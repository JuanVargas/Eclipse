one which is &quot;easier&quot; to support, e.g. it makes fewer claims of substance. Even critics of the weak anthropic principle recognize that it is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[truism]]&lt;!--, albeit a &quot;vacuously true&quot; statement [removed for the time being] --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;The Limitations of Scientific Truth: Why Science Can't Answer Life's Questions - By Nigel Brush (2005), ISBN 978-0-8254-2253-9 pp. 217&lt;/ref&gt;  However, building up other substantive arguments based on a tautological foundation is problematic.  Stronger variants of the anthropic principle are not tautologies and make substantive claims which may be considered controversial by some.

In 1961, [[Robert Dicke]] noted that the [[age of the universe]], as seen by living observers, cannot be random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Robert Dicke |author = Dicke, R. H.  | journal = Nature | title = Dirac's Cosmology and Mach's Principle | volume = 192 | pages = 440–441| year = 1961 | doi = 10.1038/192440a0|bibcode = 1961Natur.192..440D | issue=4801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, biological factors constrain the universe to be more or less in a &quot;golden age,&quot; neither too young nor too old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Paul Davies | author = Davies, P. | title = The Goldilocks Enigma | publisher = Allen Lane| year = 2006 | isbn = 0713998830}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the universe were one tenth as old as its present age, there would not have been sufficient time to build up appreciable levels of
[[metallicity]] (levels of elements besides [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]) especially [[carbon]], by [[nucleosynthesis]].  Small rocky planets did not yet exist.  If the universe were 10 times older than it actually is, most stars would be too old to remain on the [[main sequence]] and would have turned into [[white dwarf]]s, aside from the dimmest [[red dwarf]]s, and stable planetary systems would have already come to an end. Thus Dicke explained away the rough coincidence between large dimensionless numbers constructed from the constants of physics and the age of the universe, a coincidence which had inspired [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis|Dirac's varying-G theory]].

Dicke later reasoned that the density of matter in the universe must be almost exactly the [[critical density]] needed to prevent the [[Big Crunch]] (the &quot;Dicke coincidences&quot; [[argument]]). The most recent measurements may suggest that the observed density of [[baryon]]ic matter, and some theoretical predictions of the amount of [[dark matter]] account for about 30% of this critical density, with the rest contributed by a [[cosmological constant]]. [[Steven Weinberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Steven Weinberg | author = Weinberg, S. | title = Anthropic bound on the cosmological constant | journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 59| pages = 2607–2610| year = 1987 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.2607 | pmid = 10035596 | issue = 22 | bibcode=1987PhRvL..59.2607W}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an anthropic explanation for this fact: he noted that the cosmological constant has a remarkably low value, some 120 [[orders of magnitude]] smaller than the value [[particle physics]] predicts (this has been described as the &quot;worst prediction in physics&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newscientist.com/blog/space/2007/02/physicists-debate-nature-of-space-time.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the cosmological constant were more than about 10 times its observed value, the universe would suffer catastrophic [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], which would preclude the formation of stars, and hence life.

The observed values of the [[dimensionless physical constant]]s (such as the [[fine-structure constant]]) governing the four [[fundamental interaction]]s are balanced as if [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned]] to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life. A slight increase in the [[strong nuclear force]] would bind the [[dineutron]] and the [[diproton]], and [[nuclear fusion]] would have converted all hydrogen in the early universe to [[helium]]. Water and the long-lived stable stars essential for the emergence of life would not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe's age, structure, and capacity for life.

==Origin==
The phrase &quot;anthropic principle&quot; first appeared in [[Brandon Carter]]'s contribution to a 1973 [[Kraków]] [[symposium]] honouring [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] 500th birthday. Carter, a theoretical astrophysicist, articulated the Anthropic Principle in reaction to the [[Copernican Principle]], which states that humans do not occupy a privileged position in the [[Universe]]. As Carter said: &quot;Although our situation is not necessarily ''central'', it is inevitably privileged to some extent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=B.| last = Carter | authorlink = Brandon Carter | booktitle =IAU Symposium 63: Confrontation of Cosmological Theories with Observational Data | publisher =Reidel | year = 1974 | location = Dordrecht |title = Large Number Coincidences and the Anthropic Principle in Cosmology | pages = 291–298}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Carter disagreed with using the Copernican principle to justify the [[Perfect Cosmological Principle]], which states that all large regions ''and times'' in the universe must be statistically identical. The latter principle underlay the [[steady-state theory]], which had recently been falsified by the 1965 discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. This discovery was unequivocal evidence that the universe has changed radically over time (for example, via the [[Big Bang]]).

Carter defined two forms of the Anthropic Principle, a &quot;weak&quot; one which referred only to anthropic selection of privileged [[spacetime]] locations in the universe, and a more controversial &quot;strong&quot; form which addressed the values of the [[fundamental constant]]s of physics.

[[Roger Penrose]] explained the weak form as follows:

{{quote|&quot;The argument can be used to explain why the conditions happen to be just right for the existence of (intelligent) life on the earth at the present time. For if they were not just right, then we should not have found ourselves to be here now, but somewhere else, at some other appropriate time. This principle was used very effectively by Brandon Carter and [[Robert Dicke]] to resolve an issue that had puzzled physicists for a good many years. The issue concerned various striking numerical relations that are observed to hold between the physical constants (the [[gravitational constant]], the mass of the [[proton]], the [[age of the universe]], etc.). A puzzling aspect of this was that some of the relations hold only at the present epoch in the earth's history, so we appear, coincidentally, to be living at a very special time (give or take a few million years!). This was later explained, by Carter and Dicke, by the fact that this epoch coincided with the lifetime of what are called [[main-sequence]] stars, such as the sun. At any other epoch, so the argument ran, there would be no intelligent life around in order to measure the physical constants in question &amp;mdash; so the coincidence had to hold, simply because there would be [[Sapience|intelligent life]] around only at the particular time that the coincidence did hold!&quot;|''[[The Emperor's New Mind]], Chapter 10''}}

One reason this is plausible is that there are many other places and times in which we can imagine finding ourselves. But when applying the strong principle, we only have one Universe, with one set of fundamental parameters, so what exactly is the point being made? Carter offers two possibilities: First, we can use our own existence to make &quot;predictions&quot; about the parameters. But second, &quot;as a last resort&quot;, we can convert these predictions into ''explanations'' by assuming that there ''is'' more than one Universe, in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes, something that is now called a [[multiverse]] (&quot;world ensemble&quot; was Carter's term), in which the parameters (and perhaps the laws of physics) vary across universes. The strong principle then becomes an example of a [[selection effect]], exactly analogous to the weak principle. Postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step, but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question which had seemed to be out of the reach of normal science: &quot;why do the [[list of laws of science|fundamental laws of physics]] take the particular form we observe and not another?&quot;

Since Carter's 1973 paper, the term &quot;Anthropic Principle&quot; has been extended to cover a number of ideas which differ in important ways from those he espoused. Particular confusion was caused in 1986 by the book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{BarrowTipler1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; published that year which distinguished between &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; anthropic principle in a way very different from Carter's, as discussed in the next section.

Carter was not the first to invoke some form of the anthropic principle. In fact, the [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] anticipated the anthropic principle as long ago as 1904: &quot;Such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been absolutely required ... in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink = Alfred R. Wallace | author = Wallace, A.

[changes in the values of the fundamental constants of physics] would preclude the existence of man to consider the problem.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dicke | first = R.

==Variants==
'''Weak anthropic principle (WAP)''' ([[Brandon Carter|Carter]]): &quot;we must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location in the universe is ''necessarily'' privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;Note that for Carter, &quot;location&quot; refers to our location in time as well as space.

'''Strong anthropic principle (SAP)''' (Carter): &quot;the Universe (and hence the [[Dimensionless physical constant|fundamental parameters]] on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage. To paraphrase [[Descartes]], ''cogito ergo mundus talis est''.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;The Latin tag (&quot;I think, therefore the world is such [as it is]&quot;) makes it clear that &quot;must&quot; indicates a [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from the fact of our existence; the statement is thus a [[truism]].

In their 1986 book, ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'', [[John D. Barrow|John Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]] depart from Carter and define the WAP and SAP as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barrow, John D. | title = Anthropic Definitions | journal = Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume = 24| pages = 146–53 | doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/14/4/002 | year = 1997|arxiv = gr-qc/9702052 |bibcode = 1997CQGra..14L..69T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrow &amp; Tipler's definitions are quoted verbatim at ''[http://www.dhushara.com/book/quantcos/anth/anth.htm Genesis of Eden Diversity Encyclopedia.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Weak anthropic principle (WAP)''' (Barrow and Tipler): &quot;The observed values of all physical and [[cosmological]] quantities are not equally probable but they take on values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where [[carbon-based life]] can [[evolution|evolve]] and by the requirements that the Universe be old enough for it to have already done so.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Unlike Carter they restrict the principle to carbon-based life, rather than just &quot;observers.&quot; A more important difference is that they apply the WAP to the [[fundamental physical constant]]s, such as the [[fine structure constant]], the number of [[Spacetime#Privileged_character_of_3+1_spacetime|spacetime dimensions]], and the [[cosmological constant]] —, topics that fall under Carter's SAP.

'''Strong anthropic principle (SAP)''' (Barrow and Tipler): &quot;The Universe must have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/br&gt;This looks very similar to Carter's SAP, but unlike the case with Carter's SAP, the &quot;must&quot; is an imperative, as shown by the following three possible elaborations of the SAP, each proposed by Barrow and Tipler:&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;There exists one possible Universe 'designed' with the goal of generating and sustaining 'observers.'&quot;&lt;/br&gt;This can be seen as simply the classic [[design argument]] restated in the garb of contemporary [[cosmology]]. It implies that the purpose of the universe is to give rise to [[Sapience|intelligent life]], with the [[physical law|laws of nature]] and their [[fundamental physical constant]]s set to ensure that life as we know it will emerge and evolve.
* &quot;Observers are necessary to bring the Universe into being.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;Barrow and Tipler believe that this is a valid conclusion from [[quantum mechanics]], as [[John Archibald Wheeler]] has suggested, especially via his [[Digital_physics#Wheeler.27s_.22it_from_bit.22|participatory universe]] and '''Participatory Anthropic Principle''' (PAP).
* &quot;An ensemble of other different universes is necessary for the existence of our Universe.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;By contrast, Carter merely says that an [[multiverse|ensemble of universes]] is necessary for the SAP to count as an explanation.

'''Modified anthropic principle (MAP)''' (Schmidhuber): The 'problem' of existence is only relevant to a species capable of formulating the question. Prior to homo sapiens' intellectual evolution to the point where the nature of the observed universe - and humans' place within same - spawned deep inquiry into its origins, the 'problem' simply did not exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;RgenSchmidhuber&quot;&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], 2000, &quot;[http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011122 Algorithmic theories of everything.]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[philosopher]]s [[John Andrew Leslie|John Leslie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author = Leslie, J. | authorlink = John Andrew Leslie | title = Probabilistic Phase Transitions and the Anthropic Principle | booktitle = Origin and Early History of the Universe: LIEGE 26 | pages = 439–444 | publisher = Knudsen | year = 1986 | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986LIACo..26..439L}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nick Bostrom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bostrom | first = N. | authorlink = Nick Bostrom | year = 2002 | title = Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-93858-9}} 5 chapters available [http://www.anthropic-principle.com/book/ online.]&lt;/ref&gt; reject the Barrow and Tipler SAP as a fundamental misreading of Carter. For Bostrom, Carter's anthropic principle just warns us to make allowance for '''anthropic bias''', that is, the bias created by anthropic [[selection effect]]s (which Bostrom calls &quot;observation&quot; selection effects) — the necessity for observers to exist in order to get a result. He writes:

{{quote|&quot;Many 'anthropic principles' are simply confused. Some, especially those drawing inspiration from Brandon Carter's seminal papers, are sound, but... they are too weak to do any real scientific work. In particular, I argue that existing methodology does not permit any observational consequences to be derived from contemporary cosmological theories, though these theories quite plainly can be and are being tested empirically by astronomers. What is needed to bridge this methodological gap is a more adequate formulation of how observation [[selection effect]]s are to be taken into account.&quot;|''Anthropic Bias'', Introduction.|&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom, N. (2002), op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Strong self-sampling assumption (SSSA)''' ([[Nick Bostrom|Bostrom]]): &quot;Each observer-moment should reason as if it were randomly selected from the class of all observer-moments in its [[reference class]].&quot;&lt;/br&gt; Analysing an observer's experience into a sequence of &quot;observer-moments&quot; helps avoid certain paradoxes; but the main ambiguity is the selection of the appropriate &quot;reference class&quot;: for Carter's WAP this might correspond to all real or potential observer-moments in our universe; for the SAP, to all in the multiverse. Bostrom's mathematical development shows that choosing either too broad or too narrow a reference class leads to counter-intuitive results, but he is not able to prescribe an ideal choice.

According to [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], the anthropic principle essentially just says that the [[conditional probability]] of finding yourself in a universe compatible with your existence is always 1. It does not allow for any additional nontrivial predictions such as &quot;gravity won't change tomorrow.&quot; To gain more predictive power, additional assumptions on the [[prior distribution]] of [[multiverse|alternative universes]] are necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;RgenSchmidhuber&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], 2002, &quot;[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/speedprior.html The Speed Prior: A New Simplicity Measure Yielding Near-Optimal Computable Predictions.]&quot; ''Proc. 15th Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory'' (COLT 2002), Sydney, Australia, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. Springer: 216-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Playwright and novelist [[Michael Frayn]] describes a form of the Strong Anthropic Principle in his 2006 book ''The Human Touch'', which explores what he characterises as &quot;the central oddity of the Universe&quot;:

{{quote|&quot;It's this simple paradox. The Universe is very old and very large. Humankind, by comparison, is only a tiny disturbance in one small corner of it - and a very recent one. Yet the universe is only very large and very old because we are here to say it is... And yet, of course, we all know perfectly well that it is what it is whether we are here or not.&quot;|&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Frayn]], ''The Human Touch''. Faber &amp; Faber ISBN 0571232175&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Character of anthropic reasoning ==
Carter chose to focus on a tautological aspect of his ideas, which has resulted in much confusion. In fact, anthropic reasoning interests scientists because of something that is only implicit in the above formal definitions, namely that we should give serious consideration to there being other universes with different values of the &quot;fundamental parameters&quot; — that is, the dimensionless [[dimensionless physical constant|physical constants]] and initial conditions for the [[Big Bang]]. Carter and others have argued that life as we know it would not be possible in most such universes. In other words, the universe we are in is [[fine-tuned universe|fine tuned]] to permit life. Collins &amp; Hawking (1973) characterized Carter's then-unpublished big idea as the postulate that &quot;there is not one universe but a whole infinite ensemble of universes with all possible initial conditions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Collins C. B., [[Stephen Hawking|Hawking, S. W.]] | title = Why is the universe isotropic? | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 180 | pages = 317–334 | year = 1973 | doi = 10.1086/151965 | bibcode=1973ApJ...180..317C}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is granted, the anthropic principle provides a plausible explanation for the fine tuning of our universe: the &quot;typical&quot; universe is not fine-tuned, but given enough universes, a small fraction thereof will be capable of supporting intelligent life. Ours must be one of these, and so the observed fine tuning should be no cause for wonder.

But how seriously can we take the multiverse? And which specific multiverse should we assume? — this question must be answered before any quantitative anthropic predictions can be made.  Although philosophers have discussed related concepts for centuries, in the early 1970s the only genuine physical theory yielding a multiverse of sorts was the [[many worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. This would allow variation in initial conditions, but not in the truly fundamental constants. Since that time a number of mechanisms for producing a multiverse have been suggested: see the review by [[Max Tegmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tegmark, M. | authorlink = Max Tegmark | title = Is 'the theory of everything' merely the ultimate ensemble theory?| journal = Annals of Physics | volume = 270 | pages = 1–51| year = 1998 | doi = 10.1006/aphy.1998.5855|arxiv = gr-qc/9704009 |bibcode = 1998AnPhy.270....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important development in the 1980s was the combination of [[inflation theory]] with the hypothesis that some parameters are determined by [[symmetry breaking]] in the early universe, which allows parameters previously thought of as &quot;fundamental constants&quot; to vary over very large distances, thus eroding the distinction between Carter's weak and strong principles. At the beginning of the 21st century, the [[string landscape]] emerged as a mechanism for varying essentially all the constants, including the number of spatial dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, the number of non-compact dimensions, see [[String theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropic idea that fundamental parameters are selected from a multitude of different possibilities (each actual in some universe or other) contrasts with the traditional hope of physicists for a [[theory of everything]] having no free parameters: as [[Einstein]] said, &quot;What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world.&quot; Quite recently, proponents of the leading candidate for a &quot;theory of everything&quot;, [[string theory]], proclaimed &quot;the end of the anthropic principle&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kane, Gordon L., Perry, Malcolm J., and Zytkow, Anna N. | title=The Beginning of the End of the Anthropic Principle | journal = New Astronomy | volume = 7 | year = 2002 | pages = 45–53 | id= | doi=10.1016/S1384-1076(01)00088-4 | arxiv=astro-ph/0001197|bibcode = 2002NewA....7...45K }}&lt;/ref&gt; since there would be no free parameters to select. Ironically, string theory now seems to offer no hope of predicting fundamental parameters, and now some who advocate it invoke the anthropic principle as well (see [[#String theory|below]]).

The modern form of a [[design argument]] is put forth by [[Intelligent design]]. Proponents of intelligent design often cite the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning]] observations that (in part) preceded the formulation of the anthropic principle by Carter as a proof of an intelligent designer. Opponents of intelligent design are not limited to those who hypothesize that other universes exist; they may also argue, anti-anthropically, that the universe is less fine-tuned than often claimed, or that accepting fine tuning as a brute fact is less astonishing than the idea of an intelligent creator. Furthermore, even accepting fine tuning, [[Elliott Sober|Sober]] (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Sober, Elliott, 2005, &quot;[http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/black-da.pdf The Design Argument]&quot; in Mann, W. E., ed., ''The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Religion''. Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ikeda and [[William H. Jefferys|Jefferys]],&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda, M. and Jefferys, W., &quot;The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism,&quot; in ''The Improbability of God,'' Michael Martin and Ricki Monnier, Editors, pp. 150-166. Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Press. ISBN 1-59102-381-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda, M. and Jefferys, W. (2006). Unpublished FAQ &quot;[http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/anthropic.html The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism.]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the Anthropic Principle as conventionally stated actually undermines intelligent design; see [[fine-tuned universe]].

[[Paul Davies]]'s book ''[[The Goldilocks Enigma]]'' (2006) reviews the current state of the fine tuning debate in detail, and concludes by enumerating the following responses to that debate:
#The absurd universe
#:Our universe just happens to be the way it is.
#The unique universe
#:There is a deep underlying unity in physics which necessitates the universe being the way it is. Some [[Theory of Everything]] will explain why the various features of the Universe must have exactly the values that we see.
#The multiverse
#:Multiple Universes exist, having all possible combinations of characteristics, and we inevitably find ourselves within a Universe that allows us to exist.
#Creationism
#:A creator designed the Universe with the purpose of supporting complexity and the emergence of Intelligence.
#The life principle
#:There is an underlying principle that constrains the universe to evolve towards life and mind.
#The self-explaining universe
#:A closed explanatory or causal loop: &quot;perhaps only universes with a capacity for consciousness can exist.&quot; This is [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler's]] Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP).
#The fake universe
#:We live inside a virtual reality simulation.

Omitted here is [[Lee Smolin]]'s model of [[Fecund universes theory|cosmological natural selection]], also known as &quot;fecund universes,&quot; which proposes that universes have &quot;offspring&quot; which are more plentiful if they resemble our universe. Also see Gardner (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, James N., 2005, &quot;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0647.html The Physical Constants as Biosignature: An anthropic retrodiction of the Selfish Biocosm Hypothesis,]&quot; ''International Journal of Astrobiology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly each of these hypotheses resolve some aspects of the puzzle, while leaving others unanswered. Followers of Carter would admit only option 3 as an anthropic explanation, whereas 3 through 6 are covered by different versions of Barrow and Tipler's SAP (which would also include 7 if it is considered a variant of 4, as in Tipler 1994).

The anthropic principle, at least as Carter conceived it, can be applied on scales much smaller than the whole universe. For example, Carter (1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carter, B. | title = The anthropic principle and its implications for biological evolution | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | volume = A310 | pages = 347–363 | year = 1983 | doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/14/4/002 |arxiv = gr-qc/9702052 |bibcode = 1997CQGra..14L..69T }}&lt;/ref&gt; inverted the usual line of reasoning and pointed out that when interpreting the evolutionary record, one must take into account [[cosmological]] and [[astrophysical]] considerations. With this in mind, Carter concluded that given the best estimates of the [[age of the universe]], the evolutionary chain culminating in ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' probably admits only one or two low probability links. [[Antonio Feoli]] and [[Salvatore Rampone]] dispute this conclusion, arguing instead that the estimated size of our universe and the number of planets in it allows for a higher bound, so that there is no need to invoke intelligent design to explain evolution.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Feoli, A. and Rampone, S. | id =  | title = Is the Strong Anthropic Principle too weak?  |journal = Nuovo Cim. | volume = B114 |  year = 1999 | pages = 281–289 | doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/14/4/002 | arxiv=gr-qc/9812093|bibcode = 1997CQGra..14L..69T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observational evidence==
No possible observational evidence bears on Carter's WAP, as it is merely advice to the scientist and asserts nothing debatable. The obvious test of Barrow's SAP, which says that the Universe is &quot;required&quot; to support life, is to find evidence of life in universes other than ours. However, as any other universe is, by definition, unobservable (otherwise it would be part of our universe), this test cannot be carried out, and Barrow's SAP is untestable.

Philosopher [[John Andrew Leslie|John Leslie]]&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, J. (1986) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the Carter SAP (with [[multiverse]]) predicts the following:
* Physical theory will evolve so as to strengthen the hypothesis that early [[phase transition]]s occur probabilistically rather than deterministically, in which case there will be no deep physical reason for the values of fundamental constants;
* Various theories for generating [[multiverse|multiple universes]] will prove robust;
* Evidence that the universe is [[fine tuned universe|fine tuned]] will continue to accumulate;
* No life with a [[alternative biochemistry|non-carbon chemistry]] will be discovered;
* Mathematical studies of [[galaxy formation]] will confirm that it is sensitive to the rate of [[expansion of the universe]].

Hogan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hogan, Craig | title = Why is the universe just so? | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume =  72 | year = 2000 | pages = 1149–1161 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.72.1149 | bibcode=2000RvMP...72.1149H|arxiv = astro-ph/9909295 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has emphasised that it would be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact we might have to resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe ''not'' to support life.

Probabilistic predictions of parameter values can be made given:&lt;/br&gt;
(i) a particular multiverse with a &quot;[[measure theory|measure]]&quot;, i.e. a well defined &quot;density of universes&quot; (so, for parameter ''X'', one can calculate the [[prior probability]] ''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) ''dX'' that ''X'' is in the range ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''X'' &lt; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''dX''), and&lt;/br&gt;
(ii) an estimate of the number of observers in each universe, ''N''(''X'') (e.g., this might be taken as proportional to the number of stars in the universe).&lt;/br&gt;
The probability of observing value ''X'' is then proportional to ''N''(''X'') ''P''(''X'').
(A more sophisticated analysis is that of [[Nick Bostrom]].)&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom (2002), op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; A generic feature of an analysis of this nature is that the expected values of the [[fundamental physical constant]]s should not be &quot;over-tuned,&quot; i.e. if there is some perfectly tuned predicted value (e.g. zero), the observed value need be no closer to that predicted value than what is required to make life possible. The small but finite value of the [[cosmological constant]] can be regarded as a successful prediction in this sense.

One thing that would ''not'' count as evidence for the Anthropic Principle is evidence  that the Earth or the [[solar system]] occupied a privileged position in the universe, in violation of the [[Copernican principle]] (for possible counterevidence to this principle, see [[Copernican principle]]), unless there was some reason to think that that position was a [[necessary condition]] for our existence as observers.

==Applications of the principle==
{{Synthesis|date=December 2010}}

===The nucleosynthesis of carbon-12===
[[Fred Hoyle]] may have invoked anthropic reasoning to predict an astrophysical phenomenon. He is said to have reasoned from the prevalence on earth of life forms whose chemistry was based on [[carbon-12]] [[atom]]s, that there must be an undiscovered [[resonance]] in the carbon-12 nucleus facilitating its synthesis in stellar interiors via the [[triple-alpha process]]. He then calculated the energy of this undiscovered resonance to be 7.6 million [[electron-volt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
University of Birmingham [http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm Life, Bent Chains and the Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rev. Mod. Phys.'' 29 (1957) 547&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Alfred Fowler|Willie Fowler]]'s research group soon found this resonance, and its measured energy was close to Hoyle's prediction.

However, a recently released paper argues that Hoyle did not use anthropic reasoning to make this prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Kragh, Helge (2010) When is a prediction anthropic? Fred Hoyle and the 7.65 MeV carbon resonance. http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/5332/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic inflation ===
{{Main|Cosmic inflation}}

[[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]] criticized the entire theory of [[cosmic inflation]] as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = D.N. | last = Page | year= 1983 | title = Inflation does not explain time asymmetry | journal = Nature | volume = 304 | pages = 39 | doi = 10.1038/304039a0|bibcode = 1983Natur.304...39P | issue=5921}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized that initial conditions which made possible a thermodynamic [[arrow of time]] in a universe with a [[Big Bang]] origin, must include the assumption that at the initial singularity, the [[entropy]] of the universe was low and therefore extremely improbable. [[Paul Davies]] rebutted this criticism by invoking an inflationary version of the anthropic principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = P.C.W. | last = Davies |authorlink = Paul Davies | year = 1984 | title = Inflation to the universe and time asymmetry | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | pages =  524 | doi = 10.1038/312524a0|bibcode = 1984Natur.312..524D | issue=5994}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Davies accepted the premise that the initial state of the visible Universe (which filled a microscopic amount of space before inflating) had to possess a very low entropy value — due to random quantum fluctuations — to account for the observed thermodynamic arrow of time, he deemed this fact an advantage for the theory. That the tiny patch of space from which our observable Universe grew had to be extremely orderly, to allow the post-inflation universe to have an arrow of time, makes it unnecessary to adopt any &quot;ad hoc&quot; hypotheses about the initial entropy state, hypotheses other Big Bang theories require.

=== String theory ===
{{Main|String theory landscape}}

[[String theory]] predicts a large number of possible universes, called the &quot;backgrounds&quot; or &quot;vacua.&quot; The set of these vacua is often called the &quot;[[multiverse (science)|multiverse]]&quot; or &quot;[[String theory landscape|anthropic landscape]]&quot; or &quot;string landscape.&quot; [[Leonard Susskind]] has argued that the existence of a large number of vacua puts anthropic reasoning on firm ground: only universes whose properties are such as to allow observers to exist are observed, while a possibly much larger set of universes lacking such properties go unnoticed.

[[Steven Weinberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author = Weinberg, S. | authorlink = Steven Weinberg | year = 2007 | title = Living in the multiverse | booktitle = Universe or multiverse? | editor = B. Carr (ed) | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0521848415}} [http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0511037 preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; believes the Anthropic Principle may be appropriated by [[cosmologist]]s committed to [[nontheism]], and refers to that Principle as a &quot;turning point&quot; in modern science because applying it to the string landscape &quot;...may explain how the [[fundamental physical constant|constants of nature]] that we observe can take values suitable for life without being fine-tuned by a benevolent creator.&quot; Others, most notably [[David Gross]] but also [[Lubos Motl]], [[Peter Woit]], and [[Lee Smolin]], argue that this is not predictive. [[Max Tegmark]],&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark (1998) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mario Livio]], and [[Martin Rees]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Livio, M.  and Rees, M. J. | title = Anthropic reasoning | journal =  Science| volume =  309 | pages = 1022 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1126/science.1111446 | pmid = 16099967 | issue = 5737|bibcode = 2005Sci...309.1022L }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that only some aspects of a physical theory need be observable and/or testable for the theory to be accepted, and that many well-accepted theories are far from completely testable at present.

[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] (2000–2002) points out that [[Ray Solomonoff]]'s theory of universal [[inductive inference]] and its extensions already provide a framework for maximizing our confidence in any theory, given a limited sequence of physical observations, and some [[prior distribution]] on the set of possible explanations of the universe.

===Ice density===
When water freezes into ice, the ice floats because ice is less dense than liquid water. This is one possible example of the anthropic principle, because if ice did not float, it might have been difficult or impossible for living organisms to have existed in water; without the insulating properties of a top ice layer, lakes and ponds would tend to freeze solid and thaw very little during warmer periods.  This principle has been criticized as neglecting the existence of the tropical zone and other warmer climates.

Ice is unusual in that it is approximately 9% less dense than liquid water. Water is the only known [[nonmetal|non-metallic]] substance to expand when it freezes. The [[density]] of ice is 0.9167 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 0°C, whereas water has a density of 0.9998 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at the same temperature. Liquid water is densest, essentially 1.00 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, at 4°C and becomes less dense as the water molecules begin to form the [[Hexagonal (crystal system)|hexagonal]] [[crystal]]s&lt;ref&gt;The word ''crystal'' derives from Greek word for [[frost]].&lt;/ref&gt; of [[ice crystals|ice]] as the freezing point is reached. This is due to [[hydrogen bond]]ing dominating the intermolecular forces, which results in a packing of [[molecules]] less compact in the solid.

==''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle''==
The most thorough extant study of the anthropic principle is the book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]], a [[cosmologist]], and [[Frank J. Tipler]], a mathematical physicist. This book sets out in great detail the many known anthropic coincidences and constraints, including many found by its authors. While the book is primarily a work of theoretical [[astrophysics]], it also touches on [[quantum physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[earth science]]. An entire chapter argues that [[homo sapiens]] is, with high probability, the only [[extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent species]] in the [[Milky Way]].

The book begins with an extensive review of many topics in the [[history of ideas]] the authors deem relevant to the anthropic principle, because the authors believe that principle has important antecedents in the notions of [[teleology]] and [[intelligent design]]. They discuss the writings of [[Fichte]], [[Hegel]], [[Bergson]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and the [[Omega Point]] cosmology of [[Teilhard de Chardin]]. Barrow and Tipler carefully distinguish [[teleology|teleological]] reasoning from ''eutaxiological'' reasoning; the former asserts that order must have a consequent purpose; the latter asserts more modestly that order must have a planned cause. They attribute this important but nearly always overlooked distinction to an obscure 1883 book by L. E. Hicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Hicks| first= L. E.| year=1883| title=A Critique of Design Arguments| location=New York| publisher=Scribner's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing little sense in a principle requiring intelligent life to emerge while remaining indifferent to the possibility of its eventual extinction, Barrow and Tipler propose the:

{{quote|&quot;[[Final anthropic principle]] (FAP): Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.&quot;|&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Barrow and Tipler submit that the FAP is both a valid physical statement and &quot;closely connected with moral values.&quot; FAP places strong constraints on the structure of the [[universe]], constraints developed further in Tipler's ''The Physics of Immortality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = F. J. | last = Tipler |authorlink = Frank Tipler | title = The Physics of Immortality | publisher = DoubleDay | year = 1994 |isbn =  0385467982}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such constraint is that the universe must end in a [[big crunch]], which seems unlikely in view of the tentative conclusions drawn since 1998 about [[dark energy]], based on observations of very distant [[supernova]]s.

In his review&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, M.]], &quot;WAP, SAP, PAP, and FAP,&quot; ''The New York Review of Books 23'', No. 8 (May 8, 1986): 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt; of Barrow and Tipler, [[Martin Gardner]] ridiculed the FAP by quoting the last two sentences of their book as defining a Completely Ridiculous Anthropic Principle (CRAP):

{{quote|&quot;At the instant the [[Omega Point]] is reached, life will have gained control of ''all'' matter and forces not only in a single universe, but in all universes whose existence is logically possible; life will have spread into ''all'' spatial regions in all universes which could logically exist, and will have stored an infinite amount of information, including ''all'' bits of knowledge which it is logically possible to know. And this is the end.&quot;|&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 677&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticisms==
Carter himself&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Carter (2004) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; has frequently regretted his own choice of the word &quot;anthropic,&quot; because it conveys the misleading impression that the principle involves humans specifically, rather than intelligent observers in general. Others&lt;ref&gt;e.g. message from [[Martin Rees]] presented at the Kavli-CERCA conference (see video in External links)&lt;/ref&gt; have criticised the word &quot;principle&quot; as being too grandiose to describe straightforward applications of [[selection effects]].

A common criticism of Carter's SAP is that it is an easy [[deus ex machina]] which discourages searches for physical explanations. To quote Penrose again: &quot;it tends to be invoked by theorists whenever they do not have a good enough theory to explain the observed facts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Penrose, R. |authorlink = Roger Penrose | title = The Emperor's New Mind | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0198519737 | year =1989}} Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter's SAP and Barrow and Tipler's WAP have been dismissed as [[truism]]s or tautologies, that is, statements true solely by virtue of their [[logical form]] (the conclusion is identical to the premise) and not because a substantive claim is made and supported by observation of reality. As such, they are criticized as an elaborate way of saying &quot;if things were different, they would be different,&quot; which is a valid statement, but does not make a claim of some factual alternative over another. The anthropic principles implicitly posit that our ability to ponder cosmology at all is contingent on one or more [[fundamental physical constant]]s having numerical values falling within quite a narrow range, and this is not a tautology; nor is postulating a [[multiverse]]. Moreover, working out the consequences of a change in the fundamental constants for the existence of our species is far from trivial, and, as we have seen, can lead to quite unexpected constraints on physical theory. This reasoning does, however, demonstrate that carbon-based life is impossible under these altered fundamental parameters.

Critics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP claim that it is neither testable nor falsifiable, and thus is not a [[scientific method|scientific statement]] but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a [[multiverse]], although some argue that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes as a function of the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Starkman, G. D., Trotta, R. | title = Why Anthropic Reasoning Cannot Predict Λ | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 97 |pages = 201301 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.201301 | pmid = 17155671 | issue = 20 | bibcode=2006PhRvL..97t1301S|arxiv = astro-ph/0607227 }} See also this [http://www.physorg.com/news83924839.html news story.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many criticisms focus on versions of the Strong Anthropic Principle, such as Barrett and Tipler's ''anthropic cosmological principle'', which are [[Teleology|teleological]] notions that tend to describe the existence of life as a ''necessary prerequisite'' for the observable constants of physics. In a lecture titled &quot;The Confusion of Cause and Effect in Bad Science,&quot; the paleophysicist Caroline Miller said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| last=Miller| first=Caroline| year =2006| title=The Confusion of Cause and Effect in Bad Science| booktitle=Lecture at Piffard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&quot;The Anthropic Principle is based on the underlying belief that the universe was created for our benefit. Unfortunately for its adherents, all of the reality-based evidence at our disposal contradicts this belief. In a nonanthropocentric universe, there is no need for multiple universes or supernatural entities to explain life as we know it.&quot;}}

Similarly, [[Stephen Jay Gould]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay| year =1998| title=Clear Thinking in the Sciences |booktitle=Lectures at Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay | year= 2002 | title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time| isbn=0716730901  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Shermer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Shermer| first=Michael | year= 2007 | title=Why Darwin Matters| isbn=0805081216}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others claim that the stronger versions of the Anthropic Principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house [[barnacle]]s. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned]] through [[natural selection]] to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to physics, and not vice versa.

Some applications of the anthropic principle have been criticized as an [[argument by lack of imagination]], for tacitly assuming that carbon compounds and water are the only possible chemistry of life (sometimes called &quot;[[carbon chauvinism]]&quot;, see also [[alternative biochemistry]]).&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite journal | author = [[Bernard Carr|Carr, B. J.]], [[Martin Rees|Rees, M. J.]] | title = The anthropic principle and the structure of the physical world | journal = Nature | volume = 278 | pages = 605–612| year = 1979 | doi = 10.1038/278605a0 | bibcode=1979Natur.278..605C | issue=5705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of [[fundamental physical constant]]s consistent with the evolution of carbon-based life may also be wider than those who advocate a [[fine tuned universe]] have argued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Stenger| first=Victor J| authorlink = Victor Stenger | year= 2000| title=Timeless Reality: Symmetry, Simplicity, and Multiple Universes| publisher=Prometheus Books| isbn = 1-57392-859-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Harnik et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Harnik, R., Kribs, G., Perez, G. | year = 2006 | title =A Universe without Weak interactions | journal = Physical Review | volume = D74 | pages = 035006 | doi =10.1088/0264-9381/14/4/002|arxiv = gr-qc/9702052 |bibcode = 1997CQGra..14L..69T }} [http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/hep-ph/0604027 preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; propose a [[weakless universe]] in which the [[weak nuclear force]] is eliminated. They show that this has no significant effect on the other [[fundamental interaction]]s, provided some adjustments are made in how those interactions work. However, if some of the fine-tuned details of our universe were violated, that would rule out complex structures of any kind — [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[galaxies]], etc.

[[Lee Smolin]] has offered a theory designed to improve on the lack of imagination that anthropic principles have been accused of. He puts forth his [[Fecund universes#Fecund universes|fecund universes]] theory, which assumes universes have &quot;offspring&quot; through the creation of [[black hole]]s, and that these offspring universes have values of physical constants that depend on these of the mother universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Lee Smolin]] | editor=[[Neil deGrasse Tyson|Tyson, Neil deGrasse]] and [[Steven Soter|Soter, Steve]]| year=2001| title=Cosmic Horizons: Astronomy at the Cutting Edge | publisher= The New Press| isbn = 978-1565846029 | pages =148–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=May 2009}}{{Verify credibility|date=May 2009}} Some versions of the anthropic principle are only interesting if the range of physical constants that allow certain kinds of life are unlikely in a landscape of possible universes. But Lee Smolin assumes that conditions for carbon based life are similar to conditions for black hole creation, which would change the [[a priori distribution]] of universes such that universes containing life would be likely. In &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/smolin_susskind04/smolin_susskind.html Smolin vs. Susskind: The Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=May 2009}}{{Verify credibility|date=May 2009}} the string theorist [[Leonard Susskind]] disagrees about some assumptions in [[Lee Smolin]]'s theory, while Smolin defends his theory.

The philosophers of cosmology [[John Earman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Earman John | year = 1987 | title = The SAP also rises: A critical examination of the anthropic principle | url = | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 307–317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernan McMullin]] &lt;ref&gt;McMullin, Ernan. (1994). &quot;Fine-tuning the universe?&quot; In M. Shale &amp; G. Shields (ed.), ''Science, Technology, and Religious Ideas'', Lanham: University Press of America.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jesús Mosterín]] contend that &quot;in its weak version, the anthropic principle is a mere tautology, which does not allow us to explain anything or to predict anything that we did not already know. In its strong version, it is a gratuitous speculation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mosterín, Jesús. (2005). Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; A further criticism by Mosterín concerns the flawed &quot;anthropic&quot; inference from the assumption of an infinity of worlds to the existence of one like ours:

{{quote|“The suggestion that an infinity of objects characterized by certain numbers or properties implies the existence among them of objects with any combination of those numbers or characteristics [...] is mistaken. An infinity does not imply at all that any arrangement is present or repeated. [...] The assumption that all possible worlds are realized in an infinite universe is equivalent to the assertion that any infinite set of numbers contains all numbers (or at least all Gödel numbers of the [defining] sequences), which is obviously false.”}}

The '''Australian Army''' is Australia's military land force. It is part of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) along with the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. While the Chief of Defence (CDF) commands the Australian Defence Force (ADF), the Army is commanded by the Chief of Army (CA). The CA is therefore subordinate to the CDF, but is also directly responsible to the Minister for Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/da190356/s9.html| title=Defence Act (1903) - SECT 9 Command of Defence Force and arms of Defence Force| publisher= Australasian Legal Information Institute| accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Australian soldiers have been involved in a number of minor and major conflicts throughout its history, only in [[World War II]] has Australian territory come under direct attack.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Australian Army}}
[[Image:Lone Pine (AWM A02025).jpg|left|thumb|200px|A trench at Lone Pine after the battle, showing Australian and Turkish dead on the parapet]]
The history of the Australian Army can be divided into two periods:
*1901–1947, when limits were set on the size of the '''Regular Army''', the vast majority of peacetime soldiers were in '''Reserve''' units of the [[Citizens Military Force]] (also known as the CMF or Militia), and [[Australian Imperial Force]]s were formed to serve overseas, and
*Post-1947, when a standing peacetime regular [[infantry]] force was formed and the CMF (known as the Army Reserve after 1980) began to decline in importance.

During its history the Australian Army has fought a large number of major wars, including: [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902), [[First World War]] (1914–1918), the [[Second World War]] (1939–1945), [[Korea War]] (1950–1953), [[Malayan Emergency]] (1950–1960), [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]] (1962–1966), [[Vietnam War]] (1962–1973) and more recently in [[War in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] (2001 – Present) and [[Iraq]] (2003 – Present). However, since 1947 it has also been involved in many peacekeeping operations, usually under the auspices of the [[United Nations]]. The largest one began in 1999 in [[International Force for East Timor|East Timor]]. Other notable operations include peacekeeping on [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]] and in the [[Solomon Islands]], which are still ongoing to this day. Humanitarian relief after [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] in [[Aceh]] Province, [[Indonesia]], [[Operation Sumatra Assist]], ended on 24 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/peacekeeping/ |title=Australian War Memorial Official History of Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations |accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current deployments===
{{Main|Current Australian Defence Force deployments}}
[[Image:ASLAV Iraq.jpg|left|thumb|200px|ASLAVs in Iraq in 2006]]
The Australian Army currently has significant forces deployed on three major operations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.defence.gov.au/op/index.htm| title=Global Operations| work=Department of Defence| publisher=Australian Government| date=3 March 2010| accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Operation Kruger]]''' – Australia's [[Security Detachment Iraq (Australia)|embassy security detachment]] which provides security protection and escort for staff at the Australian Embassy in [[Baghdad]], and consists of 100 personnel.
* '''[[Operation Slipper]]''' – Australia's commitment to the [[War on Terror]]. The army contribution is primarily concentrated in [[Afghanistan]], including the ''Mentoring Task Force'' attached to the US-led [[Combat Team Oruzgan]] in [[Oruzgan Province]], consisting of an infantry battalion with attached cavalry, engineer and artillery force elements. Other forces include the ''Special Operations Task Group'' which includes SASR and Commando force elements operating in Oruzgan and Kandahar provinces.
* '''[[Operation Astute]]''' – Approximately 400 Australian personnel and 140 New Zealand personnel are deployed to East Timor as part of the ISF that is working in support of the Government of East Timor and the United Nations to maintain peace and stability.
* '''[[RAMSI|Operation Anode]]''' – Australia's commitment to the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] (RAMSI) Consists of a 160-strong Combined Task Force. The ADF contributes around 80 to 120 troops to this Task Force
* '''[[Operation Mazurka]]''' – Australia's commitment to Multinational Force and Observers (MFO). From 1982–1986, the RAAF provided rotary wing aviation support. Since 1994 the Australian Army has maintained a presence within the organisation. Currently 25 personnel rotate twice a year, being employed in key HQ, operations and logistics positions.
* '''[[Operation Paladin]]''' – is the Army's longest ongoing operation, where Australian personnel have served since 1956. Operation Paladin is Australia's contribution to the UN Truce Supervision Organisation that was established in 1948 to supervise the truce agreed at the conclusion of the first Arab/Israeli War.

==Colours, standards and guidons==
{{Main|Colours, standards and guidons}}
[[Image:AustArmyBanner.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William Deane|Governor-General Sir William Deane]] presents the new Army Banner to the Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army in 2001]]
Infantry, and some other combat units of the Australian Army carry flags called the Queen's colour and the Regimental Colour, known as 'the Colours'. Armoured units carry Guidons – flags smaller than Colours traditionally carried by Cavalry, Lancer, Light Horse and Mounted Infantry units. Artillery units' Guns are considered to be their Colours, and on parade are provided with the same respect. Non-combat units (combat service support corps) do not have Colours, as Colours are battle flags and so are only available to combat units. As a substitute, many have Standards or Banners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Flags, Military Flags, &amp; Queens and Regimental Colours |publisher=Digger History |url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-flags/0-flag-cat-index.htm |accessdate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Units awarded [[battle honours]] have them emblazoned on their Colours, Standards and Guidons. They are a link to the Unit's past and a memorial to the fallen. Artillery do not have Battle Honours; their single Honour is &quot;Ubique&quot; which means &quot;Everywhere&quot;.

[[Image:AustArmyColours.jpg|thumb|left|450px|All colours of the Army were on parade for the centenary of the Army, 10 March 2001]]

The Army is the guardian of the [[Flag of Australia|National Flag]] and as such, unlike the Royal Australian Air Force, does not have a flag or Colours. The Army, instead, has a banner, known as the Army Banner. To commemorate the centenary of the Army, the Governor General Sir William Deane, presented the Army with a new Banner at a parade in front of the [[Australian War Memorial]] on 10 March 2001. The Banner was presented to the Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army, WO1 Peter Rosemond.

The Army banner bears the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Australian Coat of Arms]] on the obverse, with the dates &quot;1901–2001&quot; in gold in the upper hoist. The reverse bears the 'rising sun' badge of the Australian Army, flanked by seven [[Battle honours|campaign honours]] on small gold-edged scrolls: [[Second Boer War|South Africa]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Korean War|Korea]], [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya-Borneo]], [[Vietnam War|South Vietnam]], and Peacekeeping. The banner is trimmed with gold fringe, has gold and crimson cords and tassels, and is mounted on a pike with the usual British royal crest finial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Army Flags (Australia) |publisher=Flags of the World |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/au%5Earmy.html |accessdate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==
===Strength===
In the 2008–09 financial year the Army had an average strength of 44,892 personnel, including 27,828 permanent (regular) and 17,064 active reservists (part-time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| url=http://www.defence.gov.au/budget/08-09/dar/2008-2009_Defence_DAR_06_v1s5.pdf| title=Defence Annual Report 2008-09 Volume 1 Department of Defence: Section 5| author=Department of Defence| publisher=Australian Government| page=195-200| date=23 October 2009|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition there are another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Australian National Audit Office |title=Army Reserve Forces |publisher=Australian National Audit Office |location=Canberra |year=2009 |series=Audit Report No.31 2008–09 |isbn=10367632 |url=http://www.anao.gov.au/uploads/documents/2008-09_Audit_Report_No.31.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regular Army is targeted to expand to 30,500 personnel by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ward|first=Stephen|title=Promotion is Army's future|newspaper=Army News|location=|page=21|language=|publisher=Australian Department of Defence|date=13 May 2010|url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rank and insignia===
{{Main|Australian Army officer rank insignia|Australian Army enlisted rank insignia}}
The ranks of the Australian Army are based on the ranks of the [[British Army]], and carry mostly the same actual [[Australian Army officer rank insignia|insignia]]. For [[officer (armed forces)|officer]]s the ranks are identical except for the shoulder title &quot;Australia&quot;. The [[Non-Commissioned Officer]] [[Australian Army enlisted rank insignia|insignia]] are the same up until [[Warrant Officer]] ranks, where they are stylised for Australia (for example, using the Australian, rather than the British coat of arms).

===Current recruiting issues===
[[Image:Tandem thurst 01.jpg|thumb|200px|An infantryman training with a [[Leopard 1]] tank in 2001]]

On 24 August 2006, the then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] announced a requirement for an extra 2,600 soldiers for the Australian Army, in addition to a previously announced increase of 1,500. Recent remarks{{by whom|date=January 2011}} of low morale in the Army, a high desire to leave the armed forces for civilian careers amongst serving soldiers, low unemployment figures for school-leavers and university graduates, as well as general opposition for Australian soldiers serving in Iraq have resulted in the Army falling short of its recruiting expectations.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The new campaign, which included the raising of two new infantry battalions ready for overseas deployment by 2010, reportedly cost $A10 billion. The first of the new battalions, to be operational by 2008, was formed by the de-amalgamation of 5/7 RAR into the reformed [[5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|5th Battalion]] and [[7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|7th Battalion]], Royal Australian Regimment. The second battalion to be re-raised was the [[8th/9th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]]. Prime Minister John Howard cited causes for this requirement as the threat of unstable, possibly terrorist-harbouring states in Australia’s immediate region:

{{quote|&quot;Look at what happened in East Timor. Look at what happened in the Solomon Islands. Think back a few years to [[Fiji]]. Think of [[Vanuatu]]. Think of the inherently unstable situation in [[Papua New Guinea]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PM Announces Army Expansion| first=Alexandra| last=Kirk|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=24 August 2006| url=http://www.abc.net.au/cgi-bin/common/printfriendly.pl?http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1723437.htm |accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The statement drew opposition from the Papua New Guinean Prime Minister, [[Sir Michael Somare]], who claimed on 25 August 2006 that an expansion of the Australian Army would actually be in response to its forces already deployed in the Middle East, and not for the possibility of threat from its Pacific neighbours.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

On 15 October 2006 the then Defence Minister [[Brendan Nelson]] announced that the Army would implement a new &quot;try before you buy&quot; recruitment-system, reducing the Initial Minimum Period of Service (IMPS) from four years to one year for enlisted soldiers. Aimed at school leavers, this system is designed to reduce the impact of joining the army for recruits entering the work force, making the option of military service more attractive. This is known as the &quot;ADF Gap Year&quot;, playing on the term of &quot;[[gap year]]&quot; where school-leavers take a year off before going to university to study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|title=Doorstop Interview – Defence recruitment, Iraq| subject=Brendan Nelson |publisher=Department of Defence |url=http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/NelsonMinTranscripttpl.cfm?CurrentId=6075| date=15 October 2006 |accessdate=19 October 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign nationals with prior military service have also been permitted to join the Australian Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.defencejobs.gov.au/recruitmentcentre/canIJoin/overseasApplicants/army.aspx| title=Overseas Applicants: Army| work=Defence Jobs| publisher=Defence Force Recruiting| accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern that the plan also may result in an overall reduction in the fitness-, medical and age-restrictions placed on applicants, in order to &quot;modernise&quot; the restrictions and also assist in boosting numbers drew criticism of these plans within some{{which?|date=January 2011}} veterans' organisations. Along with this announcement, arguments for more and better equipment were advanced, with speculation of a possible increase in the numbers of M113 APCs, [[Bushmaster IMV]] and [[M1A1 Abrams]] tanks being acquired. Indeed, in late 2008 additional Bushmasters and upgraded M113s were ordered for the Australian Army in significant numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;minister.defence.gov.au&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=Contract Signed for Additional Bushmasters |url=http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/Fitzgibbontpl.cfm?CurrentId=8381 |publisher=The Hon. Joel Fitzgibbon MP, Minister for Defence |date=29 October 2008 |accessdate=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-2007, following an extensive multi-million dollar advertising-campaign seeking recruits, high enlistment numbers exceeded the government's target by 1,004 persons. But due to the lack of available and adequate training facilities and personnel more than 85 percent of applicants waited for between 35 days and 6 months to start their training, resulting in dropouts in recruits during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Australian Army Rise Up Recruitment |publisher=The Inspiration Room Daily |url=http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2007/australian-army-rise-up-recruitment |accessdate=10 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, plans to create a second recruit-training battalion have been put forward, but that may take years to eventuate, if at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Diggers in hole as boom recruits go untrained |publisher=news.com.au |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21778691-421,00.html |accessdate=23 May 2007}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Registry for Internet Numbers''' ('''ARIN''') is the [[Regional Internet Registry]] (RIR) for [[Canada]], many Caribbean and North Atlantic islands, and the [[United States]]. ARIN manages the distribution of Internet number resources, including [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] address space and [[Autonomous system (Internet)|AS numbers]]. ARIN opened its doors for business on December 22, 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arin.net/about_us/history.html About ARIN]&lt;/ref&gt; after incorporating on April 18, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arin.net/about_us/corp_docs/artic_incorp.html Articles of Incorporation ]&lt;/ref&gt; ARIN is a nonprofit corporation in [[Virginia]], a [[United States|U.S.]] state. It is headquartered in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], by [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Chantilly, Virginia|Chantilly]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.arin.net/contact_us.html Contact Us].&quot; American Registry for Internet Numbers.

ARIN is one of five [[Regional Internet registry|Regional Internet Registries]] (RIRs) in the world. Like the other RIRs, ARIN:

*Provides services related to the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources
*Facilitates policy development by its members and stakeholders
*Participates in the international Internet community
*Is a nonprofit, community-based organization
*Is governed by an executive board elected by its membership

==Services==
ARIN provides services related to the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources. The nature of these services is described in ARIN's mission statement:

:''Applying the principles of stewardship, ARIN, a nonprofit corporation, allocates Internet Protocol resources; develops consensus-based policies; and facilitates the advancement of the Internet through information and educational outreach.''

These services are grouped in three areas: Registration, Organization, and Policy Development.

===Registration Services===
Registration Services pertain to the technical coordination and inventory management of Internet number resources. Services include:

*IPv4 address allocation and assignment
*IPv6 address allocation and assignment
*[[Autonomous system (Internet)|AS number]] assignment
*Directory services including:
**Registration transaction information (WHOIS)
**Routing information (Internet Routing Registry)
*DNS (Reverse)

For information on requesting Internet number resources from ARIN, see https://www.arin.net/resources/index.html. This section includes the request templates, specific distribution policies, and guidelines for requesting and managing Internet number resources.

===Organization Services===
Organization Services pertain to interaction between stakeholders, ARIN members, and ARIN. Services include:

*Elections
*Members meetings
*Information publication and dissemination
*Education and training

===Policy Development Services===
Policy Development Services facilitate the development of policy for the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources.

All ARIN policies are set by the community. Everyone is encouraged to participate in the policy development process at public policy meetings and on the Public Policy Mailing List (ppml@arin.net). The ARIN Board of Trustees ratifies policies only after:

#discussion on mailing lists and at meetings;
#ARIN Advisory Council recommendation;
#community consensus in favor of the policy; and
#full legal and fiscal review.

The community develops policies by following a formal Policy Development Process as outlined at https://www.arin.net/policy/pdp.html. The Number Resource Policy Manual, ARIN’s complete set of current policies, is available at https://www.arin.net/policy/nrpm.html.

'''Membership is not required to participate in ARIN’s policy development process or to apply for Internet number resources.'''

Services include:

*Maintaining discussion e-mail lists
*Conducting public policy meetings
*Publishing policy documents

==Organizational structure==
ARIN consists of the Internet community within its region, its members, a 7-member Board of Trustees, a 15-member Advisory Council, and a professional staff of about 50. The Board of Trustees and Advisory Council are elected by ARIN members for three-year terms.

===Board of trustees===
The ARIN membership elects the Board of Trustees (BoT), which has ultimate responsibility for the business affairs and financial health of ARIN, and manages ARIN's operations in a manner consistent with the guidance received from the Advisory Council and the goals set by the registry's members. The BoT is responsible for determining the disposition of all revenues received to ensure all services are provided in an equitable manner. The BoT ratifies proposals generated from the membership and submitted through the Advisory Council. Executive decisions are carried out following approval by the BoT.

The BoT consists of 7 members:
*Paul Andersen
*[[Scott Bradner]] (Treasurer)
*[[John Curran (businessman)|John Curran]] (President and CEO)
*Timothy Denton
*Lee Howard (Secretary)
*[[Paul Vixie]] (Chairman)
*[[Bill Woodcock]]

===Advisory Council===
In addition to the BoT, ARIN has an Advisory Council that advises ARIN and the BoT on IP allocation policy and related matters. Adhering to the procedures in the Internet Resource Policy Evaluation Process, the Advisory Council forwards consensus-based policy proposals to the BoT for ratification.

The Advisory Council consists of 15 elected members:

*Dan Alexander
*Cathy Aronson
*Marla Azinger
*Marc Crandall
*Bill Darte
*Owen DeLong
*David Farmer
*Stacy Hughes
*Scott Leibrand
*Chris Morrow
*Bill Sandiford
*Robert Seastrom
*Heather Schiller
*John Sweeting (Chair)
*Tom Zeller

==History==
[[Image:Arinlogo-sml.jpg|right|frame|ARIN Logo from 1998 until 2001]]

The organization was formed in December 1997 to &quot;provide [[Internet Protocol|IP]] registration services as an independent, nonprofit corporation.&quot; Until this time IP registration in the ARIN region was done by a department within the [[Network Solutions]] corporation, which provided the initial staff and  computer infrastructure for ARIN.  

The initial Board of Trustees consisted of  [[Scott Bradner]], [[John Curran (businessman)|John Curran]], Kim Hubbard, Don Telage, Randy Bush, Raymundo Vega Aguilar, and [[Jon Postel]] as an ex-officio member.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arin.net/about_us/fmr_board.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first president of ARIN was Kim Hubbard, from 1997 until 2000. Kim was succeeded by Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Plzak until the end of 2008. Trustee John Curran was acting President until July 1 of 2009 when he assumed the CEO role permanently.

Until late 2002 it served [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], [[South America]] and all of the [[Caribbean]]. [[LACNIC]] now handles parts of the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and South America. Also, [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was part of its region until April 2005, when [[AfriNIC]] was officially recognized by [[ICANN]] as the fifth [[Regional Internet Registry]].

{{nihongo|'''Akihabara'''|秋葉原||&quot;Field of Autumn Leaves&quot;}}, also known as {{nihongo|'''Akihabara Electric Town'''|秋葉原電気街|Akihabara Denki Gai}}, is an area of [[Tokyo]], Japan. It is located less than five minutes by rail from [[Tokyo Station]]. Its name is frequently shortened to {{nihongo|''Akiba''|アキバ}} in Japan. While there is an official locality named Akihabara nearby, part of [[Taitō, Tokyo|Taitō-ku]], the area known to most people as ''Akihabara'' (including the railway station of the [[Akihabara Station|same name]]) is actually Soto-Kanda, a part of [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]]-ku.

Akihabara is a major shopping area for electronic, computer, [[anime]], and [[otaku]] goods, including new and used items. New items are mostly to be found on the main street, Chūōdōri, with many kinds of used items found in the back streets of Soto Kanda 3-[[Japanese addressing system|chōme]]. New parts for PC-building are readily available from a variety of stores. Tools, electrical parts, wires, microsized cameras and similar items are found in the cramped passageways of Soto Kanda 1-chōme (near the station). Foreign tourists tend to visit the big name shops like Laox or other speciality shops near the station, though there is more variety and lower prices at locales a little further away. Akihabara gained some fame through being home to one of the first stores devoted to personal robots and robotics.

The area was just out of Sujikai-gomon [[city gate]] (present [[Manseibashi|Mansei bridge]]) which was one of the city gates (Mitsuke) of old [[Edo]] (Tokyo). It was the gateway from inner Edo to northern and northwestern Japan and Kan’ei-ji temple in [[Ueno, Tokyo|Ueno]]. Many dealers, craftsmen and relatively lower class [[samurai]] lived there.

==Timeline==
[[File:Akihabara 2006-02-23 a.jpg|right|thumb|Buildings in Akihabara]]
[[File:Akihabara picture3.jpg|right|thumb|Between stores in Akihabara]]

* '''1869''': A major blaze destroyed the area. It brought about the decision to clear the 30,000 square metres of land in order to keep future fires from getting into inner Tokyo city.
* '''1870''': In this cleared land a small [[Shinto]] shrine once in old [[Edo Castle]] was built. The shrine's name was {{lang|ja|鎮火社|Chinka-sha}}, which means &quot;the extinguisher shrine&quot;). But many downtown Tokyo residents misunderstood the shrine. They thought that the deity Akiba or Akiha ({{lang|ja|秋葉}}) which was the most popular fire-controlling deity in central and eastern Japan must have been enshrined in it. They also called the cleared land &quot;Akiba ga hara&quot; or &quot;Akibappara&quot; which means &quot;the deity Akiba's square&quot;.
* '''1888''': The shrine moved to Matsugaya, near [[Asakusa]].
* '''1890''': Extension of the rail line (now the [[Tōhoku Main Line]]) from Ueno to Akihabara. At first there was no passenger service, for south of the station was the Akihabara cargo docks, where goods from all over the world would flow into Kanda by river and be hauled up the east bank of the canal to be ticketed at the central cargo transport window.
* From the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] to the [[Shōwa period]], as the electric railway improved transport to Akihabara and the surrounds, and especially  due to the growth in dealerships, the district was designated as Seika Shijō ({{lang|ja|青果市場}}: vegetables and fruits market).
* '''1925''': Akihabara-Tokyo station connection opened as the [[Keihin-Tōhoku_Line|Tohoku line]] extended to Tokyo.
* '''1930''': The temporary [[Manseibashi Subway Station]] opens; it is closed in November 1931.
* '''1935''': Official establishment of Seika Shijō. (Kanda Seika Shijō).
* '''1936''': The site of [[Manseibashi Station#JNR Manseibashi Station|Manseibashi Station]] was closed (later the Transportation Museum—now closed). Railway mania had reached its zenith. The area became the number one place for electrical supplies.
*'''Circa 1945-1955''' After World War II, a black market at Kanda developed around the first school of electrical manufacturing (now the [[Tokyo Denki University]]:{{lang|ja|東京電機大学}}). Clustered around the [[Sōbu Main Line|Sobu Main line]], what began as a host of electrical stores selling [[vacuum tube]]s, radio goods and electrical items to the students, has today come to be known as Electric Town. Called &quot;musen&quot; or &quot;wireless&quot; shops, they were the first to begin selling radios. With the advent of wireless and radio goods, people came to be much more connected.
* '''1960s''': Thanks to advanced technology, the rival [[Den Den Town|Nipponbashi]] district of [[Osaka]] took its position as an equally prominent Electric Town, selling vast volumes of household [[consumer]] [[durable good]]s such as televisions, [[refrigerator]]s and [[washing machine]]s.
* '''1980s''': Accompanying the spread of the [[personal computer]] in family homes (&quot;Famikon&quot;), local shops increasingly began to deal in [[computer game]]s, and major gaming chain stores appeared on the market.
* '''1989''': Kanda Seika Shijō moved to [[Ōta-ku]], south district of Tokyo.
* '''1990s''': With the Yamada and Kojima household chain stores appearing throughout the suburban outskirts of Tokyo, the sale of consumer durables at Akihabara was greatly reduced, but the sale of computer goods increased in equal measure.
* '''1991''':[[Sofmap]] begins its rise as a major seller of new and used Japan-market computer parts and software, including popular systems from [[NEC]] (PC-8801 and 9801), [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] (X68000) and [[Fujitsu]] (FM-Towns). Sofmap chain stores begin popping up in different locations in Akihabara.
* '''1994''': The Windows PC boom and accompanying computer store growth began.
* It was also during the 1990s that the anime craze grew out of computer games, and the youth group known as otaku began to pour into Akihabara.
* '''Since 2000''', with name-brand computer sales in decline, anime shops have arisen in their place, selling to the otaku crowd.
* '''August 25, 2005''': [[Tsukuba Express]], Tokyo's fastest private railway, opens in Akihabara.
* '''Since 2005''' Major redevelopment and modernization of the station and surrounding area.
* '''June 8, 2008''': The [[Akihabara massacre]] took place on the Sunday-[[Pedestrian zone|pedestrian-zoned]] Chūōdōri street. A man killed seven in an attack on a crowd using a truck and a [[dagger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/06/08/japan.stabbing.spree/index.html At least 6 dead in Tokyo stabbing spree] Retrieved June 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUST27752620080608 Man stabs shoppers in Tokyo street] Retrieved June 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/t10015111331000.html NHKニュース　秋葉原通り魔事件 死者６人に] &quot;NHK News Akihabara Passerby Incident Death Toll to Six&quot; Retrieved June 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''January 23, 2011''': The [[pedestrian zone]] Akihabara's Chōūdōri High Street is reopened 2 1/2 years after the massacre with a memorial service and new rules.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/akihabara-reopens-pedestrian-zone&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police station==
{{nihongo|Manseibashi Police Station|万世橋警察署|Manseibashi Keisatsusho}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keishicho.metro.tokyo.jp/1/manseibashi/ 万世橋警察署 ：警視庁&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is a station of [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]]. The station takes its name from the nearby bridge, [[Manseibashi]]. The area north of the bridge is Akihabara Electric Town&quot;.

The station is located slightly east of the Mansei bridge ({{Coord|35|41|50.2|N|139|46|18.5|E|region:JP_scale:2500}}), on the Akihabara side of the Kanda River.&lt;ref name=&quot;manseibashipolicesummary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of Manseibashi Police Station|url=http://www.keishicho.metro.tokyo.jp/1/manseibashi/gaiyo/gaiyo.htm|publisher=[[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the police station, the building houses other government offices.

The station began as a substation of Kanda Police Station in April 1905. It was disbanded a year later, but re-established in various forms until June 1927, when it was established as the Kanda Manseibashi Police Station. It moved back in with the Kanda station after the station was destroyed in the [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|World War II fire-bombing of Tokyo]]. In November 1948 the station was re-established under its present name, Manseibashi Police Station.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Active Directory''' (AD) is a [[directory service]] created by [[Microsoft]].

Active Directory uses a number of standardized protocols to provide a variety of [[network service]]s, including:
* [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]] LDAP, the industry standard directory access protocol, compatible with many management and query applications. Active Directory supports LDAPv3 and LDAPv2.
* Optional [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]]-based [[authentication]]
* [[Domain Name System|DNS]]-based naming and other network information

Features include:
* Central location for network administration and security&lt;ref name=&quot;adw2k3&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Information security and single sign-on for user access to networked resources&lt;ref name=&quot;adw2k3&quot;/&gt;
* The ability to scale up or down easily&lt;ref name=&quot;adw2k3&quot;/&gt;
* Standardizing access to application data&lt;ref name=&quot;adw2k3&quot;/&gt;
* Synchronization of directory updates across servers&lt;ref name=&quot;adw2k3&quot;/&gt;

Active Directory stores all information and settings for a deployment in a central database. Active Directory allows administrators to assign policies, deploy and update software. Active Directory networks can vary from a small installation with a few computers, users and printers to tens of thousands of users, many different network [[Windows Server domain|domain]]s and large [[server farm]]s spanning many geographical locations.

==History==
Active Directory was previewed in 1999, released first with [[Windows 2000]] Server edition, and revised to extend functionality and improve administration in [[Windows Server 2003]]. Additional improvements were made in [[Windows Server 2003#Windows Server 2003 R2|Windows Server 2003 R2]], [[Windows Server 2008#Active Directory roles|Windows Server 2008]] and [[Windows Server 2008 R2#Active Directory roles|Windows Server 2008 R2]] and was renamed '''Active Directory Domain Services'''.

Active Directory was called '''NTDS''' ([[Windows NT|NT]] Directory Service) in older Microsoft documents. This name can still be seen in some Active Directory [[Executable|binaries]].

==Structure==
===Objects===
An Active Directory structure is a hierarchical arrangement of information about [[Object (computing)|objects]]. The objects fall into two broad categories: resources (e.g., printers) and [[security principal]]s (user or computer accounts and groups). Security principals are assigned unique security identifiers (SIDs).

Each object represents a single entity&amp;mdash;whether a user, a computer, a printer, or a group&amp;mdash;and its attributes. Certain objects can contain other objects. An object is uniquely identified by its name and has a set of attributes&amp;mdash;the characteristics and information that the object represents&amp;mdash; defined by a [[database schema|schema]], which also determines the kinds of objects that can be stored in Active Directory.

Each attribute object can be used to define multiple [[schema object]]s. The schema object allows the schema to be extended or modified when necessary. However, because each schema object is integral to the definition of Active Directory objects, deactivating or changing these objects can fundamentally change and/or disrupt a deployment. Schema changes automatically propagate throughout the system. Once created, an object can only be deactivated&amp;mdash;not deleted. Changing the schema usually requires planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Windows Server 2003: Active Directory Infrastructure|year=2003|publisher=Microsoft Press|pages=1–8 &amp;ndash; 1–9|isbn=0-7356-1438-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sites====
A '''Site''' object in Active Directory represents a geographic location that hosts networks. Sites contain objects called [[subnetwork|subnets]].&lt;ref name=&quot;technet1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web
        | url       = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727051.aspx
        | title     = Managing Sites
        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation
        | quote     = An Active Directory site object represents a collection of Internet Protocol (IP) subnets, usually constituting a physical Local Area Network (LAN).
    }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forests, trees, and domains===
The Active Directory framework that holds the objects can be viewed at a number of levels. The forest, tree, and domain are the logical divisions in an Active Directory network.

Within a deployment, objects are grouped into domains. The objects for a single domain are stored in a single database (which can be replicated). Domains are identified by their [[Domain Name System|DNS]] name structure, the [[namespace]].

A tree is a collection of one or more domains and domain trees in a contiguous namespace, linked in a transitive trust hierarchy.

At the top of the structure is the ''forest.'' A forest is a collection of trees that share a common global catalog, directory schema, logical structure, and directory configuration. The forest represents the security boundary within which users, computers, groups, and other objects are accessible.

====Organizational units====
The objects held within a domain can be grouped into [[Organizational Unit]]s (OUs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
        | title     = Organizational Units
        | u      = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc978003.aspx
        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation
        | quote     = An organizational unit in Active Directory is analogous to a directory in the file system
        | year      = 2010
    }}
&lt;/ref&gt; OUs can provide hierarchy to a domain, ease its administration, and can resemble the organization's structure in managerial or geographical terms. OUs can contain other OUs&amp;mdash;domains are containers in this sense. Microsoft recommends using OUs rather than domains for structure and to simplify the implementation of policies and administration. The OU is the recommended level at which to apply [[group policies]], which are Active Directory objects formally named Group Policy Objects (GPOs), although policies can also be applied to domains or sites (see below). The OU is the level at which administrative powers are commonly delegated, but delegation can be performed on individual objects or attributes as well.

Organizational Units are an abstraction for the administrator and do not function as containers; the underlying domain is the true container. It is not possible, for example, to create user accounts with an identical username (sAMAccountName) in separate OUs, such as &quot;fred.staff-ou.domain&quot; and &quot;fred.student-ou.domain&quot;, where &quot;staff-ou&quot; and &quot;student-ou&quot; are the OUs. This is so because sAMAccountName, a user object attribute, must be unique within the domain.

As the number of users in a domain increases, conventions such as &quot;first initial, middle initial, last name&quot; will fail for common names like ''Smith'', ''Garcia'', or ''Lee''. Workarounds include adding a digit to the end of the username or using the unique employee/student id number.

Because duplicate usernames cannot exist within a domain, account name generation poses a significant challenge for large organizations that can not be easily subdivided into separate domains, such as students in a public school system or university who must be able to use any computer across the network.

=====Shadow groups=====
[[File:Active directory - OUs can not be given rights to objects.png|thumb|left|In Active Directory, organizational units cannot be assigned as owners or trustees. Only groups are selectable, and members of OUs can not be collectively assigned rights to directory objects.]]
OUs do not confer access permissions, and objects placed within OUs are not automatically assigned access privileges based on their containing OU. It is a separate step for an administrator to assign an object in an OU to be a member of a group that is also within that OU. Relying on OU location alone to determine access permissions is unreliable because the object may not have been assigned to the group object for that OU.

A common practice is for an administrator to write a custom [[PowerShell]] or [[Visual Basic]] script to automatically create and maintain a ''user group'' for each OU in their directory. The scripts are run periodically to update the group to match the OU's account membership. Such groups are known as ''Shadow Groups''. Once created, these shadow groups are selectable in place of the OU in the administrative tools.

Microsoft refers to shadow groups in the Server 2008 Reference documentation, but does not explain how to create them. There are no built-in server methods or console snap-ins for managing shadow groups.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft Server 2008 Reference, discussing shadow groups used for fine-grained password policies: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc770394%28WS.10%29.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 

The division of an organization's information infrastructure into a hierarchy of one or more domains and top-level OUs is a key decision. Common models are by business unit, by geographical location, by IT Service, or by object type and hybrids of these. OUs should be structured primarily to facilitate administrative delegation, and secondarily, to facilitate group policy application. Although OUs form an administrative boundary, the only true security boundary is the forest itself and an administrator of any domain in the forest must be trusted across all domains in the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

        | date      = 2005-01-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical matters==
''Sites'' are physical, rather than logical, groupings defined by one or more [[Internet Protocol|IP]] subnets.&lt;ref&gt;
   {{Cite web
        | title     = Sites overview
        | url       = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782048(WS.10).aspx
        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation
        | quote     = A site is a set of well-connected subnets.
        | date      = 2005-01-21
    }}
&lt;/ref&gt; AD also holds the definitions of connections, distinguishing low-speed (e.g., [[Wide area network|WAN]], [[Virtual private network|VPN]]) from high-speed (e.g., [[local area network|LAN]]) links. Site definitions are independent of the domain and OU structure and are common across the forest. Sites are used to control network traffic generated by replication and also to refer clients to the nearest domain controllers. [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange Server 2007]] uses the site topology for mail routing. Policies can also be defined at the site level.

Physically the Active Directory information is held on one or more peer [[domain controller]]s (DCs), replacing the [[Windows NT|NT]] [[Primary Domain Controller|PDC]]/[[Backup Domain Controller|BDC]] model. Each DC has a copy of the Active Directory. Servers joined to Active Directory that are not domain controllers are called Member Servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
        | title     = Planning for domain controllers and member servers
        | url       = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc737059(WS.10).aspx

        | date      = 2005-01-21
    }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Active Directory database is organized in ''partitions'', each holding specific object types and following a specific replication pattern. AD synchronizes changes using ''[[multi-master replication]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

        | title     = Directory data store
        | url       = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc736627(WS.10).aspx

        | quote     = Active Directory uses four distinct directory partition types to store [...] data. Directory partitions contain domain, configuration, schema, and application data.
        | date      = 2005-01-21    }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft often refers to these partitions as 'naming contexts'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
        | title      = Active Directory Replication Traffic

        | publisher  = Microsoft Corporation
        | author     = Andreas Luther
        | quote      = The Active Directory is made up of one or more naming contexts or partitions.
        | accessdate = 2010-05-26    }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Schema' partition contains the definition of object classes and attributes within the Forest. The 'Configuration' partition contains information on the physical structure and configuration of the forest (such as the site topology). Both replicate to all domain controllers in the Forest.  The 'Domain' partition holds all objects created in that domain and replicates only to Domain Controllers within its domain. So, for example, a user created in Domain A would be listed only in Domain A's domain controllers.
A subset of objects in the domain partition replicate to domain controllers that are configured as global catalogs. Global catalog (GC) servers provide a global listing of all objects in the Forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

        | title     = What Is the Global Catalog?

        | quote     = [...] a domain controller can locate only the objects in its domain. [...] The global catalog provides the ability to locate objects from any domain [...]    }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Catalog servers replicate to themselves all objects from all domains and hence, provide a global listing of objects in the forest. However, in order to minimize replication traffic and to keep the GC's database small, only selected attributes of each object are replicated. This is called the partial attribute set (PAS). The PAS can be modified by modifying the schema and marking attributes for replication to the GC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
        | title     = Attributes Included in the Global Catalog
        | url       = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675160%28VS.85%29.aspx

        | date      = 2010-08-26
        | quote     = The isMemberOfPartialAttributeSet attribute of an attributeSchema object is set to TRUE if the attribute is replicated to the global catalog. [...] When deciding whether or not to place an attribute in the global catalog remember that you are trading increased replication and increased disk storage on global catalog servers for, potentially, faster query performance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Earlier versions of Windows used [[NetBIOS]] to communicate. Active Directory is fully integrated with DNS and requires [[TCPIP|TCP/IP]]—DNS. To be fully functional, the DNS server must support [[SRV record|SRV resource records]] or service records.

==Replication==
Active Directory replication is 'pull' rather than 'push', meaning that replicas pull changes from the server where the change was effected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
        | title     = What Is the Active Directory Replication Model?
        | url       = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc737314(WS.10).aspx
        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation
        | date      = 2003-03-28
        | quote     = Domain controllers request (pull) changes rather than send (push) changes that might not be needed.
    }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Knowledge Consistency Checker'' (KCC) creates a replication topology of ''site links'' using the defined ''sites'' to manage traffic. Intrasite replication is frequent and automatic as a result of change notification, which triggers peers to begin a pull replication cycle. Intersite replication intervals are typically less frequent and do not use change notification by default, although this is configurable and can be made identical to intrasite replication.

Each link can have a 'cost' (e.g., [[DS3]], [[Digital Signal 1|T1]], [[ISDN]] etc.) and the site link topology will be altered accordingly by the KCC. Replication may occur transitively through several site links on same-protocol ''site link bridges'', if the cost is low, although KCC automatically costs a direct site-to-site link lower than transitive connections. Site-to-site replication can be configured to occur between a ''bridgehead server'' in each site, which then replicates the changes to other DCs within the site.

Replication of Active Directory uses [[Remote Procedure Call]]s (RPC) over IP (RPC/IP). Between Sites you can use [[SMTP]] for replication, but only for changes in the Schema, Configuration, or Partial Attribute Set (Global Catalog) NCs. SMTP cannot be used for replicating the default Domain partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
        | title     = What Is Active Directory Replication Topology?

        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation
        | date      = 2003-03-28
        | quote     = SMTP can be used to transport nondomain replication [...]    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Database==
The Active Directory [[database]], the ''directory store'', in Windows 2000 Server uses the [[Microsoft JET Blue|JET Blue-based]] [[Extensible Storage Engine]] (ESE98) and is limited to 16 terabytes and 2 billion objects (but only 1 billion security principals) in each domain controller's database. Microsoft has created NTDS databases with more than 2 billion objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.technet.com&quot;&gt;[http://blogs.technet.com/efleis/archive/2006/06/08/434255.aspx Large AD database? Probably not this large...]&lt;/ref&gt; (NT4's [[Security Account Manager]] could support no more than 40,000 objects). Called NTDS.DIT, it has two main tables: the ''data table'' and the ''link table''.  In Windows Server 2003 a third main table was added for security descriptor single instancing.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.technet.com&quot;/&gt;

==Programmatic interface==
The features of Active Directory may be accessed programmatically via the [[Component Object Model|COM interface]]s provided by ''Active Directory Service Interfaces''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa772170%28VS.85%29.aspx Active Directory Service Interfaces], Microsoft&lt;/ref&gt;

==Single server operations==
'''[[FSMO|Flexible Single Master Operations]]''' ('''FSMO''', sometimes pronounced &quot;fizz-mo&quot;) operations are also known as operations master roles. Although domain controllers operate allow simultaneous updates in multiple places, certain operations are supported only on a single server. These operations are performed using the roles listed below:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Role Name
! Scope
! Description
|-
| Schema Master
| 1 per forest
| Schema modifications
|-
| Domain Naming Master
| 1 per forest
| Addition and removal of domains if present in root domain
|-
| PDC Emulator
| 1 per domain
| Provides backwards compatibility for NT4 clients for PDC operations (like password changes).  The PDC runs domain specific processes such as the Security Descriptor Propagator (SDPROP), and is the master time server within the domain. It also handles external trusts, the DFS consistency check, holds current passwords and manages all GPOs as default server.
|-
| RID Master
| 1 per domain
| Allocates pools of unique identifiers to domain controllers for use when creating objects
|-
| Infrastructure Master
| 1 per domain/partition
| Synchronizes cross-domain group membership changes.  The infrastructure master cannot run on a global catalog server (GCS) (unless all DCs are also GCs, or environment consists of a single domain).
|}

==Trust==
To allow users in one domain to access resources in another, Active Directory uses trusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
        | title     = Domain and Forest Trusts Technical Reference
        | url       = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738955(WS.10).aspx
        | publisher = Microsoft Corporation
        | date      = 2003-03-28
        | quote     = Trusts enable [...] authentication and [...] sharing resources across domains or forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trusts inside a forest are automatically created when domains are created. The forest sets the default boundaries of trust, and implicit, transitive trust is automatic for all domains within a forest.

===Terminology===
;One-way trust
:One domain allows access to users on another domain, but the other domain does not allow access to users on the first domain.
;Two-way trust
:Two domains allow access to users on both domains.
;Trusting domain
:The domain that allows access to users from a trusted domain.
;Trusted domain
:The domain that is trusted; whose users have access to the trusting domain.
;Transitive trust
:A trust that can extend beyond two domains to other trusted domains in the forest.
;Intransitive trust
:A one way trust that does not extend beyond two domains.
;Explicit trust
:A trust that an admin creates. It is not transitive and is one way only.
;Cross-link trust
:An explicit trust between domains in different trees or in the same tree when a descendant/ancestor (child/parent) relationship does not exist between the two domains.
;Shortcut
:Joins two domains in different trees, transitive, one- or two-way
;Forest
:Applies to the entire forest. Transitive, one- or two-way
;Realm
:Can be transitive or nontransitive, one- or two-way
;External
:Connect to other forests or non-AD domains. Nontransitive, one- or two-way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
        | title      = How Domain and Forest Trusts Work

Windows 2000 Server supports two-way transitive and one-way intransitive trusts. Administrators can create shortcuts.

Windows Server 2003 the ''forest root trust''. This trust can be used to connect Windows Server 2003 forests if they are operating at the 2003 forest functional level. Authentication across this type of trust is [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] based (as opposed to [[NTLM]]). Forest trusts are transitive for all the domains in the trusted forests. Forest trusts, however, are not transitive.&lt;!--this makes no sense.--&gt;

==Lightweight Directory Services==
{{anchor|ADAM}}
''AD LDS'' is a light-weight implementation of Active Directory. LDS is capable of running as a [[Windows service|service]] on computers running Microsoft [[Windows Server 2003]] or [[Windows XP|Windows XP Professional]]. LDS shares the code base with Active Directory and provides the same functionality as Active Directory, including an identical [[API]], but does not require the creation of domains or domain controllers.

Like Active Directory, LDS provides a ''Data Store'' for storage of directory data and a ''[[Directory (database)|Directory Service]]'' with an LDAP ''Directory Service Interface''. Unlike Active Directory, however, multiple LDS instances can be run on the same server.

Before [[Windows Server 2008#Active Directory roles|Windows Server 2008]], LDS was named ''Active Directory Application Mode'' (ADAM).&lt;ref name=&quot;Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa705886(VS.85).aspx  | title=AD LDS  | accessdate=2009-04-28  | publisher=Microsoft }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unix integration==
Varying levels of interoperability with Active Directory can be achieved on most Unix-like operating systems through standards-compliant LDAP clients, but these systems usually do not interpret  many attributes associated with Windows components, such as [[Group Policy]] and support for one-way trusts.

Third-parties offer Active Directory integration for Unix platforms (including UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, and a number of Java- and UNIX-based applications), including [[Centrify Corporation|Centrify]] (DirectControl), Computer Associates (UNAB), CyberSafe Limited (TrustBroker), Likewise Software ([[Likewise Open|Open]] or Enterprise), [[Quest Software]] (Authentication Services) Thursby Software Systems (ADmitMac) and [[open source]] software [[Samba (software)|Samba]] can act as a peer Active Directory domain controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba4/Releases/4.0.0alpha13|title=Samba4/Releases/4.0.0alpha13|accessdate=2010-11-29|work=SambaPeople|publisher=SAMBA Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Samba Plugfest Report&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://people.samba.org/people/2009/10/05#drs-success | title=The great DRS success! | accessdate=2009-11-02 | date=2009-10-05 | work=SambaPeople | publisher=SAMBA Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schema additions shipped with [[Windows Server 2003#Windows_Server_2003_R2|Windows Server 2003 R2]] include attributes that map closely enough to RFC 2307 to be generally usable. The reference implementation of &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 2307&lt;/nowiki&gt;, nss_ldap and pam_ldap provided by PADL.com, support these attributes directly. The default schema for group membership complies with &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 2307bis (proposed)&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.padl.com/~lukeh/rfc2307bis.txt  RFC 2307bis]&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Server 2003 R2 includes a [[Microsoft Management Console]] snap-in that creates and edits the attributes.

An alternate option is to use another directory service such as [[389 Directory Server]] (formerly Fedora Directory Server, FDS) or Sun Microsystems [[Sun Java System Directory Server]], which can perform two-way synchronization with AD and thus provide a &quot;deflected&quot; integration, as Unix and Linux clients authenticate to FDS and Windows Clients authenticate to AD. Another option is to use [[OpenLDAP]] with its ''translucent'' overlay, which can extend entries in any remote LDAP server with additional attributes stored in a local database. Clients pointed at the local database see entries containing both the remote and local attributes, while the remote database remains completely untouched.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

'''Aldona''' (baptized ''Ona'' or ''Anna''; her pagan name Aldona is known only from the writings of [[Maciej Stryjkowski]];&lt;ref name=aldona2/&gt; ca. 1309 –  26 May 1339) was the [[Queen consort|Queen]] of [[Piast Poland|Poland]] (1333–1339), and the Princess of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. She was the daughter of [[Gediminas]], Grand Duke of Lithuania.

==Biography==
Aldona married [[Casimir III of Poland]], when he was 15 or 16 years old. The bride was probably of about the same age. The marriage took place on 30 April or  16 October 1325 and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the first Polish–Lithuanian coalition against the [[Teutonic Knights]].&lt;ref name=aldona&gt;{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | last=Jonynas | first=Ignas | editor=Vaclovas Biržiška | encyclopedia=Lietuviškoji enciklopedija | title=Aldona | year=1933 | publisher=Spaudos Fondas | volume=I | location=Kaunas | pages=208–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casimir was seeking allies over the dispute of [[Pomerania]] with the Knights. Gediminas just underwent an unsuccessful attempt at [[Christianization of Lithuania]]. This coalition was a prelude to [[Union of Krewo]] in 1385 and [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569 that resulted in the new state, [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=aldona2&gt;{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia |first=Edvardas |last=Gudavičius | authorlink=Edvardas Gudavičius | editor= Vytautas Spečiūnas |encyclopedia= Lietuvos valdovai (XIII-XVIII a.): enciklopedinis žinynas |title=Aldona |year=2004 |publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos institutas |location=Vilnius |pages=40 |isbn=5-420-01535-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The details of the agreement are not known; however, it is known that Gediminas released all Polish prisoners, numbering some 25,000.&lt;ref name=aldona/&gt; The importance of the marriage was attested by the fact that Casimir abandoned his earlier plans to marry [[Jutta of Bohemia]].&lt;ref name=pious&gt;{{cite journal | first=S. C. |last=Rowell |title=Pious Princesses or Daughters of Belial: Pagan Lithuanian Dynastic Diplomacy, 1279–1423 |pages=47 | date=Spring 1994 |journal=Medieval Prosopography | volume=15 |issue=1 |issn=0198-9405 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance was put in practice when joint forces organized an attack against [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1326.&lt;ref name=pious/&gt; However, the coalition was not strong and collapsed ca. 1330, but there is no evidence of fights between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive.&lt;ref name=aldona/&gt; The marriage into the Lithuanian dynasty that ruled since ca. 1289 might have brought some legitimacy to Władysław I from the [[Piast dynasty]] who was crowned in 1320 replacing the [[Přemyslid dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Lithuania Ascending: A Pagan Empire Within East-Central Europe, 1295-1345 | first=C.

Aldona was remembered for her piety and devotion to music. Everywhere she went, she took court musicians with her. It was even suggested by [[Jan Długosz]] that [[cymbal]]s which were played in procession before her represented some [[Lithuanian mythology|pagan Lithuanian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, C. S. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 232&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband Casimir is known for his romantic affairs: after Aldona's death he married three more times. Aldona had two daughters, Cunigunde (died in 1357), who married [[Louis VI the Roman]], the son of [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], on  1 January 1345, and [[Elisabeth of Poland (1326–1361)|Elisabeth]] (died in 1361), who was married to Duke [[Bogislaus V]] of [[Pomerania]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, C. S. ''Lithuania Ascending'', xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt; Elisabeth's daughter, [[Elizabeth of Pomerania]], was the fourth wife of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]].

'''Aron Nimzowitsch''' or '''Aron Isaevich Nimtsovich''' ({{lang-lv|Ārons Ņimcovičs}}, {{lang-ru|Аро́н Иса́евич Нимцо́вич}}; born '''Aron Niemzowitsch'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/pics/cn3506_nimzowitsch_document.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; and also known as '''Aaron Nimzovich''') (7 November 1886 – 16 March 1935) was a [[Russians|Russian]]-born [[Denmark|Danish]] unofficial [[chess grandmaster]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mysystem&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | author= Aron Nimzowitsch | year=1987 | edition=Reprinted | title=[[My System]] | publisher=B.T Batsford Ltd|isbn=9-7134-5655-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a very influential chess writer. He was the foremost figure amongst the ''[[hypermodernism (chess)|hypermoderns]]''.

== Life ==
Born in [[Riga]] in [[Livonia]], then part of the [[Russian empire]], the [[Jew]]ish [[German language|German]]-speaking Nimzowitsch came from a wealthy family, where he learned [[chess]] from his father, who was a merchant. In 1904, he traveled to [[Berlin]] to study [[philosophy]], but set aside his studies soon and began a career as a professional chess player that same year. He won his first international tournament at Munich 1906.&lt;ref&gt;http://home19.inet.tele.dk/kastanie/&lt;/ref&gt; Then, he tied for first with [[Alexander Alekhine]] at St. Petersburg 1913/14 (the eighth [[Russian Chess Championship|All-Russian Masters' Tournament]]).

During the 1917 [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], Nimzowitsch was in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] war zone. He escaped being drafted into one of the armies by feigning madness, insisting that a fly was on his head. He then escaped to [[Berlin]], and gave his first name as Arnold, possibly to avoid anti-Semitic persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chesscafe.com/text/kmoch02.txt Grandmasters I Have Known - Aaron Nimzovich], by [[Hans Kmoch]], The Chess Cafe&lt;/ref&gt;

Nimzowitsch eventually moved to [[Copenhagen]] in 1922,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politietsregisterblade.dk/index.php?option=com_sfup&amp;controller=politregisterblade&amp;task=viewRegisterblad&amp;id=1926810&amp;limitstart=0 Copenhagen Police Record: &quot;Nimzowitsch, Aron, chess master, born 07-11-1886 in Riga, from 29-11-1922 living c/o Nielsen, Nansensgade 32, 1st floor, from 11-06-1923 at Missionshotellet, Løngangstræde 27, and from 28-06-1923 c/o Juul, Øster Farimagsgade 11, 2. floor]&lt;/ref&gt; which coincided with his rise to the world chess elite, where he lived for the rest of his life in one small rented room.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Oxford Companion To Chess]], 2nd  Ed. (1996), by [[David Vincent Hooper|David Hooper]] and [[Kenneth Whyld]], p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; In Copenhagen, he won twice [[Nordic Chess Championship]] in 1924 and 1934. He obtained Danish citizenship and lived in Denmark, until his death in 1935. Although he had long suffered from heart trouble, his early death was unexpected, taken ill suddenly at the end of 1934, he lay bedridden for three months before dying of [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Oxford Companion To Chess]], 2nd  Ed. (1996), by [[David Vincent Hooper|David Hooper]] and [[Kenneth Whyld]], p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in [[Bispebjerg]] Cemetery in Copenhagen.

== Chess career ==
The height of Nimzowitsch's career was the late 1920s and early 1930s. [[Chessmetrics]] places him as the third best player in the world, behind [[Alexander Alekhine]] and [[Jose Capablanca]], from 1927 to 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.chessmetrics.com/CM2/Summary.asp?Params=192510SSSSS3S000000000000111000000000000010100 Chessmetrics Summary for 1925-1935], [[Chessmetrics]] web site, accessed 7-May-2007&lt;/ref&gt; His most notable successes were first-place finishes at [[Copenhagen]] 1923, [[Marienbad]] 1925, [[Dresden]] 1926, [[Hannover]] 1926, and the [[Carlsbad 1929 chess tournament]], and second place behind Alekhine at the [[San Remo 1930 chess tournament]]. Nimzowitsch never developed a knack for match play, though; his best match success was a draw with Alekhine, but the match was only two games long and was in 1914, thirteen years before Alekhine became world champion. 

Nimzowitsch never won against Capablanca, but fared better against Alekhine. He even beat Alekhine with the [[White and Black in chess|black pieces]], in their short 1914 match at [[St Petersburg]]. One of Nimzowitsch's most famous games is his celebrated [[Immortal Zugzwang Game|immortal zugzwang game]] against [[Friedrich Sämisch|Sämisch]] at [[Copenhagen]] 1923. Another game on this theme is his win over Paul Johner at [[Dresden]] 1926. When in form, Nimzowitsch was very dangerous with the black pieces, scoring many fine wins over top players.

== Legacy ==
Nimzowitsch is considered one of the most important players and writers in chess history. His works influenced numerous other players, including [[Tartakower|Savielly Tartakower]], [[Milan Vidmar]], [[Richard Réti]], [[Akiba Rubinstein]], [[Bent Larsen]], and [[Tigran Petrosian]], and his influence is still felt today.

He wrote three books on chess strategy: ''[[Mein System]] (My System)'', 1925, ''Die Praxis meines Systems (The Practice of My System)'', 1929, commonly known as ''Chess Praxis'', and ''Die Blockade'' (The Blockade), 1925. The last of these has just been reissued in a volume containing both the German original and the English translation published by Hardinge Simpole. However,  much that is in it is covered again in ''Mein System''. It is said that 99 out of 100 chess masters have read ''Mein System''; consequently, most consider it to be Nimzowitsch's greatest contribution to chess. It sets out Nimzowitsch's most important ideas, while his second most influential work, ''Chess Praxis'', elaborates upon these ideas, adds a few new ones, and has immense value as a stimulating collection of Nimzowitsch's own games, even when these games are more entertaining than instructive.

Nimzowitsch's [[chess theory|chess theories]] flew in the face of convention. While there were those like [[Alexander Alekhine|Alekhine]], [[Emanuel Lasker]], and even [[Jose Raul Capablanca|Capablanca]] who did not live by [[Siegbert Tarrasch|Tarrasch]]'s rigid teachings, the acceptance of Tarrasch's ideas, all simplifications of the more profound work of [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], was nearly universal. That the center had to be controlled by [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] and that development had to happen in support of this control — the core ideas of Tarrasch's chess philosophy — were things every beginner thought to be irrefutable laws of nature, like gravity.

Nimzowitsch shattered these assumptions. He discovered such concepts as [[overprotection]] (the least important of his ideas from a modern standpoint though still interesting and sometimes applicable), control of the center by pieces instead of pawns, blockade, and [[prophylaxis (chess)|prophylaxis]] — playing to prevent the opponent's plans. He was also a leading advocate and exponent of the [[fianchetto]] development of the [[bishop (chess)|bishops]]. Nimzowitsch also formalised strategies using open files, outposts and invasion of the seventh rank, all of which are widely accepted today. Others had utilized such ideas in previous years, but he was the first to knit them together into a cohesive whole.

[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] (GM) [[Raymond Keene]] writes that Nimzowitsch &quot;was one of the world's leading Grandmasters for a period extending over a quarter of a century, and for some of that time he was the obvious challenger for the world championship. ... [He was also] a great and profound chess thinker, second only to Steinitz, and his works-''Die Blockade'', ''My System'' and ''Chess Praxis''-established his reputation as one of the father figures of modern chess.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Keene, ''Aron Nimzowitsch: A Reappraisal'', David McKay, 1974, p. 1. ISBN 0-679-13040-3.&lt;/ref&gt; GM [[Robert Byrne]] called him &quot;perhaps the most brilliant theoretician and teacher in the history of the game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Saidy]] and [[Norman Lessing]], ''The World of Chess'', Random House, 1974, p. 161. ISBN 0-394-48777-X.&lt;/ref&gt; GM [[Jan Hein Donner]] called Nimzowitsch &quot;a man who was too much of an artist to be able to prove he was right and who was regarded as something of a madman in his time. He would be understood only long after his death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Donner, ''The King: Chess Pieces'', New in Chess, 2006, p. 46. ISBN 90-5691-171-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many chess openings and variations are named after Nimzowitsch, the most famous being the [[Nimzo-Indian Defence]] (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4) and the less often played [[Nimzowitsch Defence]] (1.e4 Nc6). Nimzowitsch biographer [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Raymond Keene]] and others have referred to 1.f4 followed by 2.b3 as the [[Larsen's Opening|Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack]]. Keene wrote a book about the opening with that title. All of these openings exemplify Nimzowitsch's ideas about controlling the center with pieces instead of pawns. Nimzowitsch was also vital in the development of two important systems in the [[French Defence]], the [[French Defence#Winawer Variation 3...Bb4|Winawer Variation]] (in some places called the Nimzowitsch Variation; its moves are 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4) and the [[French Defence#Advance Variation 3.e5|Advance Variation]] (1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5). He also pioneered two provocative variations of the [[Sicilian Defence]], both regarded as dubious today:  the [[Sicilian Defence#Other moves in the Open Sicilian|Nimzowitsch Variation]], 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6, which invites 3.e5 Nd5, similarly to [[Alekhine's Defence]], and 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 d5?!

== Personality ==
There are many entertaining anecdotes regarding Nimzowitsch—some less savory than others. For example, he once missed first prize in a tournament in Berlin by losing to Sämisch, and when it became clear he was going to lose the game, Nimzowitsch stood up on the table and shouted, &quot;Gegen diesen Idioten muss ich verlieren!&quot; (&quot;That I should lose to this idiot!&quot;).

Nimzowitsch was annoyed by his opponents' smoking. A popular, but probably apocryphal, story is that once when an opponent laid a cigar on the table, he complained to the tournament arbiters, &quot;''he is threatening to smoke, and as an old player you must know that the threat is stronger than the execution''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Winter (chess historian)|Edward Winter]], [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/nimzowitsch.html A Nimzowitsch Story]. Retrieved on 2009-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nimzowitsch had lengthy and somewhat bitter dogmatic conflicts with Tarrasch over whose ideas constituted 'proper' chess.

Nimzowitsch's vanity and faith in his ideas of overprotection provoked [[Hans Kmoch]] to write a parody about him in February 1928 in the ''Wiener Schachzeitung''. This consisted of a [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1334664&amp;kpage=1 mock game] against the fictional player &quot;Systemsson&quot;, supposedly played and annotated by Nimzowitsch himself. The annotations gleefully exaggerate the idea of overprotection, as well as asserting the true genius of the wondrous idea. Kmoch was in fact a great admirer of Nimzowitsch, and the subject of the parody himself was amused at the effort.&lt;ref&gt;The full text of the parody is reprinted at [http://www.chesscafe.com/text/mysyspar.pdf Chesscafe.com] and in Keene's biography on Nimzowitsch (Chapter &quot;A parody by Hans Kmoch&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;  

Kmoch also wrote an article about his nine years with Nimzowitsch:&lt;ref name=&quot;KmochGrandmasters&quot;&gt;[[Hans Kmoch]], [http://www.chesscafe.com/text/kmoch02.pdf Grandmasters I Have Known]. ChessCafe.com. Retrieved on 2009-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Nimzovich suffered from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, he shook his head in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.

Nimzovitsch's colleague [[Tartakower]] observed of him, &quot;He pretends to be crazy in order to drive us all crazy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KmochGrandmasters&quot;/&gt;

'''Aragonese''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|ær|ə|ɡ|ɒ|ˈ|n|iː|z}}; {{lang|an|''aɾaɡo'nes''}} in Aragonese) is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] now spoken in a number of local varieties by between 10,000 and 30,000 people over the valleys of the [[Aragón River]], [[Sobrarbe]] and [[Ribagorza]] in [[Aragon]], [[Spain]]. It is the only remaining speech form derived from medieval [[Navarro-Aragonese]] languages.

==History==
Aragonese originated around the eighth century, as one of many [[Vulgar Latin|Latin dialects]] developed in the [[Pyrenees]] on top of a strong [[Basque language|Basque]]-like [[substratum]]. The original [[Kingdom of Aragon]] (formed by the counties of Aragon, Sobrarbe and Ribagorza) was progressively expanded from the mountain ranges towards the South, pushing the [[Moors]] farther south in the ''[[Reconquista]]'' and spreading the Aragonese language.

The dynastic union of the [[Catalonia|Catalan Counties]] and the Kingdom of Aragon&amp;mdash;which formed the [[Aragonese Crown]] in the twelfth century&amp;mdash;did not result in a merging of the language forms of the two territories into a single form; [[Catalan language|Catalan]] continued to be spoken in the east, and [[Navarro-Aragonese]] in the west. The Aragonese ''reconquista'' to the south ended in the kingdom of [[Murcia]], which was ceded by [[James I of Aragon]] to the [[Kingdom of Castile]] as a dowry for an Aragonese princess.

The spread of [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]], now more commonly known as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and the Castilian origin of the [[Trastamara]] dynasty and a strong similarity between Castilian and Aragonese, meant that further recession was to follow. One of the key moments in the history of Aragonese was when a king of Castilian origin was appointed in the fifteenth century: [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]], also known as Ferdinand of Antequera.

The mutual union of the crowns of [[crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[crown of Castile|Castile]] and the progressive suspension of all capacity of self-rule from the sixteenth century meant that Aragonese, while still widely spoken, was limited to a rural and colloquial use, as the nobility chose Spanish as their symbol of power.

During the rule of [[Francisco Franco]] in the twentieth century and the spreading of compulsory schooling, Aragonese was regarded as a mere dialect of Spanish, and therefore was frowned upon (for example, pupils were punished in schools for using it).

Then, the constitutional [[Spanish Transition|democracy]] voted by the people in 1978 also meant the debut of literary works and studies conducted in and about the Aragonese language.

==Modern Aragonese==
Today, Aragonese is still spoken natively within its core area, the Aragonese mountain ranges of the Pyrenees, in the comarcas of Somontano, Jacetania, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza.

These are the major cities and towns where Aragonese speakers can still be found: [[Huesca]], [[Graus]], [[Monzón]], [[Barbastro]], [[Bielsa]], [[Gistaín|Chistén]], [[Fonz]], [[Echo, Aragón, Spain|Echo]], [[Estadilla]], [[Benasque]], [[Campo, Spain|Campo]], [[Sabiñánigo]], [[Jaca]], [[Plan]], [[Ansó]], [[Ayerbe]], [[Broto]], and [[El Grado]].

Aragonese is also learnt as a second language by other inhabitants of the country in areas like [[Huesca]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Ejea de los Caballeros]], and [[Teruel]]. According to recent polls, altogether they only make up around 10,000 active speakers and about 30,000 passive speakers.

==Phonological characteristics==
Some historical traits of the Aragonese language:

*Open O, E from Romance result systematically into diphthongs {{IPA|[we]}}, {{IPA|[je]}}, e.g. VET'LA &gt; {{lang|an|''viella''}} (&quot;old woman&quot;, Sp. {{lang|es|''vieja''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''vella''}})

*Loss of final unstressed -E, e.g. GRANDE &gt; {{lang|an|''gran''}} (&quot;big&quot;)

*Romance initial F- is preserved, e.g. FILIUM &gt; {{lang|an|''fillo''}} (&quot;son&quot;, Sp. {{lang|es|''hijo''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''fill''}}, Pt. {{lang|pt|''filho''}})

*Romance [[Palatal approximant|yod]] (GE-, GI-, I-) results in voiceless palatal affricate ''ch'' {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, e.g. IUVENEM &gt; {{lang|an|''choven''}} (&quot;young man&quot;, Sp. {{lang|es|''joven''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''jove''}}), GELARE &gt; {{lang|an|''chelar''}} (&quot;to freeze&quot;, Sp. {{lang|es|''helar''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''gelar''}})

*Romance groups -LT-, -CT- result in {{IPA|[jt]}}, e.g. FACTUM &gt; {{lang|an|''feito''}} (&quot;done&quot;, Sp. {{lang|es|''hecho''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''fet''}}, Gal./Port. {{lang|gl|''feito''}}), MULTUM &gt; {{lang|an|''muito''}} (&quot;many&quot;/&quot;much&quot;, Sp. {{lang|es|''mucho''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''molt''}}, Gal. {{lang|gl|''moito''}}, Port. {{lang|gl|''muito''}})

*Romance groups -X-, -PS-, SCj- result into voiceless palatal fricative ''ix'' {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, e.g. COXU &gt; {{lang|an|''coixo''}} (&quot;crippled&quot;, Sp. {{lang|es|''cojo''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''coix''}})

*Romance groups -Lj-, -C'L-, -T'L- result into palatal lateral ''ll'' {{IPA|[ʎ]}}, e.g. MULIERE &gt; {{lang|an|''muller''}} (&quot;woman&quot;, Sp. {{lang|es|''mujer''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''muller''}}), ACUT'LA &gt; {{lang|an|''agulla''}} (&quot;needle&quot;, Sp. {{lang|es|''aguja''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''agulla''}})

*Latin -B- is maintained in past imperfect endings of verbs of the second and third conjugations: {{lang|an|''teneba, teniba''}} (&quot;he had&quot;, Sp. {{lang|es|''tenía''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''tenia''}}), {{lang|an|''dormiba''}} (&quot;he was sleeping&quot;, Sp. {{lang|es|''dormía''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''dormia''}})

*Aragonese, along with dialects of [[Gascon language|Gascon]], has preserved the voicelessness of many intervocalic stop consonants, e.g. CLETAM &gt; {{lang|an|''cleta''}} (&quot;sheep hurdle&quot;, Cat. {{lang|ca|''cleda''}}, Fr. {{lang|fr|''claie''}}), CUCULLIATAM &gt; ''cocullata'' (&quot;crested lark&quot;, Sp. {{lang|es|''cogujada''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''cogullada''}})

==Orthography==
In 2010, the [[Academia de l'Aragonés]], formed in 2006, has established a single orthographic standard in order to modernize medieval orthography and look for a more etymological language. This new orthography is used by the [[:an:|Aragonese Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academiadelaragones.org/biblio/PROPUESTA%20ORTOGRAFICA%20ACAR%20(copia%20protechida%20ta%20referencia).pdf Orthographic Proposal for Aragonese language]&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, Aragonese had two [[orthography|orthographic]] standards:
* The ''[[grafía de Uesca]]'' codified in 1987 by the ''Consello d'a Fabla Aragonesa'' (CFA) at a convention in [[Huesca]] (Aragonese: ''Uesca'') is used by a majority of Aragonese writers.  It uses a more uniform system when assigning letters to phonemes with less regard to the etymology of a word.  For example, words traditionally written with &quot;v&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are uniformly written with &quot;b&quot; in the Uesca system.  Likewise &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;g(+e)&quot;, and &quot;g(+i)&quot; are all written &quot;ch&quot;.  In addition, the orthography uses letters more strongly associated with Spanish (e.g., &quot;[[ñ]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charrando.com/normasgraficas.pdf Normas graficas de l'aragonés]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[grafía SLA]]'' devised in 2004 by the ''[[Sociedat de Lingüistica Aragonesa]]'' (SLA) is used by a minority of Aragonese writers.  It uses more etymological-based forms that are closer to Catalan, Occitan, and medieval Aragonese sources.  With the SLA system, &quot;v&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;g(+e)&quot;, and &quot;g(+i)&quot; are distinct forms and &quot;[[ny (digraph)|ny]]&quot; is used instead of &quot;ñ&quot;.

In the sixteenth century, Aragonese [[Morisco]]es wrote some texts [[Aljamiado|in Arabic writing]] as [[Andalusi Arabic]] was forgotten or forbidden.

==Grammar==
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
Aragonese grammar is similar to the grammar of other Iberian Romance languages, such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]].

===Pronouns===
Aragonese preserves the system of [[clitic]] pronouns derived from the Latin forms 'inde' and 'ibi', as 'en/ne' and 'bi/i/ie'.

This feature is shared with other Romance languages ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Occitan]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]]), and makes Aragonese different from other Ibero-Romance languages without those clitics ([[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]).

'En/ne' is used for:
* Partitive object: ''No n'he visto como aquello'' (''I haven't seen anything like that'', literally ''Not (of it) I have seen like that'').
* Partitive subject: ''En fa tanto de mal'' (''it hurts so much'', literally ''(of it) it causes so much of pain'')
* Ablative, place where a movement starts: ''Se'n va ra memoria'' (''memory goes away'', literally ''It (away from here) memory goes'')

'Bi/i/ie' is used for:
* Locative, place where: ''N'ibi heba uno'' (''there was one of them'', literally ''(Of them) there was one''
* Allative, movement towards somewhere: ''Vés-be'' (''(you) go there'' (imperative))

==Dialects==
There are about 25-30 dialectal variants of Aragonese, the majority of which are in the [[Huesca (province)|province of Huesca]], due to its mountainous terrain where natural [[isogloss]]es have developed around valley enclaves, and where, not surprisingly, the highest incidence of spoken Aragonese is found. [[Ribagorçan]], is one such variant: an eastern Aragonese dialect, which is transitional to [[Gascon language|Gascon]] [[Occitan]], Catalan, and Spanish.

[[Image:DynaTAC8000X.jpg|thumb|[[Motorola DynaTAC]] 8000X AMPS [[mobile phone]]]]
'''Advanced Mobile Phone System''' ('''AMPS''') was an [[analog signal|analog]] [[mobile phone]] system standard developed by [[Bell Labs]], and officially introduced in the [[Americas]] in 1983,&lt;ref name = &quot;PrivateLine&quot;&gt;[http://www.privateline.com/dailynotes/index13.html  Private Line].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;MilestonesPast&quot;&gt;[http://www.milestonespast.com/exbringing.htm  MilestonesPast].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel]] in 1986, and [[Australia]] in 1987.&lt;ref name = &quot;Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amta.org.au/default.asp?Page=142 |title=Ten years of GSM in Australia |accessdate=2008-08-16 |work=AMTA |publisher=Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the primary [[analog signal|analog]] mobile phone system in [[North America]] (and other locales) through the 1980s and into the 2000s.  As of February 18, 2008, carriers in the United States were no longer required to support AMPS and companies such as AT&amp;T and Verizon have discontinued this service permanently. AMPS was discontinued in Australia in September 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association&quot;/&gt;

== Technology ==

AMPS was a first-generation [[Cellular network|cellular]] technology that uses separate frequencies, or &quot;channels&quot;, for each conversation (see [[Frequency-division multiple access|FDMA]]).  It therefore required considerable [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] for a large number of users. In general terms, AMPS was very similar to the older &quot;0G&quot; [[Improved Mobile Telephone Service]], but used considerably more computing power in order to select frequencies, hand off conversations to [[PSTN]] lines, and handle billing and call setup.

What really separated AMPS from older systems is the &quot;back end&quot; call setup functionality.  In AMPS, the cell centers could flexibly assign channels to handsets based on signal strength, allowing the same frequency to be re-used in various locations without interference. This allowed a larger number of phones to be supported over a geographical area. AMPS pioneers fathered the term &quot;cellular&quot; because of its use of small hexagonal &quot;cells&quot; within a system.&lt;ref name=&quot;bell_young&quot;&gt;W. Rae Young, &quot;AMPS: Introduction, Background, and Objectives&quot;, Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 58, 1, pages 1-14, January 1979. ''(Note: Young was the Bell Labs engineer who invented the hexagonal cell concept.)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bell_porter&quot;&gt;Z. C. Fluhr and Philip T. Porter, &quot;AMPS: Control Architecture&quot;, Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 58, 1, pages 1-14, January 1979. ''(Note: Porter was the Bell Labs engineer who proposed that the cell towers be at the corners of the hexagons rather than the centers and have directional antennas that would transmit/receive in 3 directions into 3 adjacent hexagon cells.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

It suffered from some weaknesses when compared to today's digital technologies. Since it was an analog standard, it is very susceptible to static and noise and has no protection from eavesdropping using a  [[Scanner (radio)|scanner]]. In the 1990s, &quot;cloning&quot; was an epidemic that cost the industry millions of dollars.  An eavesdropper with specialized equipment could intercept a handset's [[Electronic Serial Number|ESN]] (Electronic Serial Number) and MIN (Mobile Identification Number, aka the telephone number). An Electronic Serial Number is a packet of data which is sent by the handset to the cellular system for billing purposes, effectively identifying that phone on the network. The system then allows or disallows calls and or features based on its customer file. If an ESN/MIN Pair is intercepted, it could then be cloned onto a different phone and used in other areas for making calls without paying.

[[Image:2007Computex e21Forum-MartinCooper.jpg|thumb|left| [[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Dr. Martin Cooper]] of Motorola, made the first private handheld mobile phone call on a larger prototype model in 1973. This is a reenactment.]]
Cell phone cloning became possible with off-the-shelf technology in the '90s.  Three key items were needed.  The first was a radio receiver, such as the Icom PCR-1000, that could tune into the Reverse Channel, which is the frequency that the phones transmit data to the tower on.  The second item was PC with a sound card and a software program called Banpaia, and the third item was a phone that could easily be used for cloning, such as the Oki 900.  By tuning the radio to the proper frequency, it would receive the signal transmitted by the cell phone to be cloned, containing the phone's ESN/MIN Pair.  This signal would be fed into the sound card audio input of the PC, and Banpaia would decode the ESN/MIN pair from this signal and display it on the screen.  The person could then input that data into the Oki 900 phone and reboot it, after which the phone network could not distinguish the Oki from the original phone whose signal had been received.  This gave the cloner, through the Oki phone, the ability to use the mobile phone service of the legitimate subscriber whose phone was cloned just as if that phone had been physically stolen instead, except that the subscriber was not without his or her phone and was not aware that the phone had been cloned—at least until that subscriber received his or her next bill.

The problem became so large that some carriers required the use of a [[Personal identification number|PIN]] before making calls. Eventually, the cellular companies initiated a system called RF Fingerprinting, where it could determine subtle differences in the signal of one phone from another and shut down some cloned phones. Some legitimate customers had problems with this though if they made certain changes to their own phone, such as replacing the battery and/or antenna. The Oki 900 was the ultimate tool of cell phone hackers because it could listen in to AMPS phone calls right out of the box with no hardware modifications.

==Standards==
AMPS was originally standardized by [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] as EIA/TIA/IS-3. EIA/TIA/IS-3 was superseded by EIA/TIA-553 and TIA interim standard IS-91 (Narrowband Advanced Mobile Phone System). AMPS networks have been replaced by digital networks based on standards including [[Digital AMPS]], [[GSM]], and [[CDMA2000]] which brought improved security as well as increased capacity.  Though cloning is still possible even with digital technologies, the cost of wireless service is so low that the problem has virtually disappeared.

==Frequency bands==

AMPS cellular service operated in the 800 [[MHz]] [[Cellular frequencies|Cellular]] [[FM]] band. For each market area, the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) allowed two licensee (networks) known as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; carriers. Each carrier within a market uses a specified &quot;block&quot; of frequencies consisting of 21 control channels and 395 voice channels. Originally, the B (wireline) side license was usually owned by the local phone company, and the A (non-wireline) license was given to wireless telephone providers.

At the inception of cellular in 1983, the FCC had granted each carrier within a market 333 channels (666 channels total). By the late 1980s, the cellular industry's subscriber base had grown into the millions across America and it became necessary to add channels for additional capacity.  In 1989, the FCC granted carriers an expansion from the current 666 channels to the final 832 (416 per carrier). The additional frequencies were from the band held in reserve for future (inevitable) expansion. These frequencies were immediately adjacent to the existing cellular band.  These bands had previously been allocated to UHF TV channels 70–83.

The anatomy of each channel is composed of 2 [[frequency|frequencies]]. 416 of these are in the 824–849&amp;nbsp;MHz range for transmissions from mobile stations to the base stations, paired with 416 frequencies in the 869–894&amp;nbsp;MHz range for transmissions from base stations to the mobile stations.  Each cell site will use a subset of these channels, and must use a different set than neighboring cells to avoid interference. This significantly reduced the number of channels available at each site in real-world systems. Each AMPS channel is 30&amp;nbsp;kHz wide.

Laws were passed in the US which prohibited the FCC [[type acceptance]] and sale of any receiver which could tune the frequency ranges occupied by analog AMPS cellular services.  Though the service is no longer offered, these laws remain in force.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;!-- where is the law --&gt;

==Digital AMPS==
Later, many AMPS networks were partially converted to [[D-AMPS]], often referred to as '''TDMA''' (though [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] is a generic term that applies to many cellular systems). D-AMPS is a [[digital]], [[2G]] standard used mainly by [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] and [[U.S. Cellular]] in the United States, [[Rogers Wireless]] in Canada, [[Telcel]] in Mexico, [[Vivo S.A.]] and [[Telecom Italia Mobile]] (TIM) in Brazil, [[VimpelCom]] in Russia, [[Movilnet]] in Venezuela. In Latin America, AMPS is no longer offered and has been replaced by [[GSM]] and new [[UMTS]] networks.

==GSM and CDMA2000==
AMPS and D-AMPS have now been phased out in favor of either [[CDMA2000]] or [[GSM]] which allow for higher capacity data transfers for services such as [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]], [[Multimedia Messaging System]] (MMS), and wireless Internet access. There are some phones capable of supporting AMPS, D-AMPS and GSM all in one phone (using the [[GAIT (wireless)|GAIT]] standard).

==Analog AMPS being replaced by digital==
In 2002, the FCC decided to no longer require A and B carriers to support AMPS service as of February 18, 2008. Since the AMPS standard is analog technology, it suffers from an inherently inefficient use of the frequency spectrum. All AMPS carriers have converted most of their consumer base to a digital standard such as CDMA2000 or GSM and continue to do so at a rapid pace.  Digital technologies such as GSM and CDMA2000 support multiple voice calls on the same channel and offer enhanced features such as two-way text messaging and data services.

Unlike in the United States, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) and [[Industry Canada]] have not set any requirement for maintaining AMPS service in Canada.  [[Rogers Wireless]] has dismantled their AMPS (along with [[IS-136]]) network, the networks were shut down May 31, 2007.  [[Bell Mobility]] and [[Telus Mobility]], who operated AMPS networks in Canada, announced that they would observe the same timetable as outlined by the FCC in the United States, and as a result would not begin to dismantle their AMPS networks until after February 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;sptnews&quot;&gt;http://www.sptnews.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=238&amp;Itemid=9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[OnStar]] relied heavily on North American AMPS service for its subscribers because, when the system was developed, AMPS offered the most comprehensive wireless coverage in the US.  In 2006, [[ADT Security Services|ADT]] asked the FCC to extend the AMPS deadline due to many of their alarm systems still using analog technology to communicate with the control centers.&lt;ref name = &quot;ITWorld&quot;&gt;[http://wireless.itworld.com/4279/061004adt/page_1.html ITWorld].&lt;/ref&gt;  Cellular companies who own an A or B license (such as Verizon and Alltel) were required to provide analog service until February 18, 2008. After that point, however, most cellular companies were eager to shut down AMPS and use the remaining channels for digital services. [[OnStar]] transitioned to digital service with the help of data transport technology developed by Airbiquity, but warned customers who could not be upgraded to digital that their service would permanently expire on January 1, 2008.&lt;ref name = &quot;OnStar&quot;&gt;[http://www.onstar.com/us_english/jsp/explore/onstar_basics/helpful_info.jsp?info-view=tech_equip  OnStar].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Companies that used analog AMPS==
* [[Verizon Wireless]] — Formerly operating an AMPS network, on February 18, 2008, Verizon has discontinued all AMPS service.  Now primarily operates on [[CDMA2000]] technology.
*[[Bell Mobility]] and [[Telus Mobility]] operated AMPS networks in Canada, though they have since been overlaid with digital services. Both Bell Mobility and Telus Mobility have announced that they will observe the same shutdown guidelines as in the United States, and will not begin decommissioning their AMPS networks until after February 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;sptnews&quot; /&gt;
* [[Alltel]] — In 2005 disclosed that only 15% of their total customer base are still using the existing analog network. The company has posted a three phase turn down [http://www.alltel.com/wps/wcm/connect/Personal/home/p/customerservice/annoucements/announcements_analog_sunset_p.html/ schedule], which was completed in September 2008. With the recent acquisition of Western Wireless, Alltel now takes the claim of the &quot;largest network in America.&quot;  The claim was true, oddly enough because of wide analog coverage in rural areas.  All Alltel AMPS and D-AMPS service was discontinued in September 2008
* [[Coastel Offshore Cellular]] — Operated an AMPS network in the Gulf of Mexico that stretched from south of Corpus Christi, TX to south of Gulf Shores, AL.  In 2006 Coastel was the only carrier in the US whose entire customer base was still 100% analog based.  In 2007 Coastel was merged with Petrocom and SOLA Communications to form [[Broadpoint]] Inc. and the network was converted to [[GSM]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadpointinc.com/aboutus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moviline ([[Telefónica]] Servicios Uno since 1971, Moviline since 1994) was the analogue service provider for the Spanish operator. Moviline has operated an ETACS 900 (mHz) network in Spain. Since 31 December 2003, the system has been closed to new users, at that time, it covered 100% of the Spanish population, but now some antennas have been given to GSM operators. The Moviline brand has been completely replaced by [[Movistar]], the digital brand of [[Telefónica]], since 1992. The network was completely converted to [[GSM]] and its in all Spanish territory. [[Movistar]] have a 3G network with [[UMTS]] technology, and offer services over [[GSM]] in places without 3G coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derecho.com/xml/disposiciones/min/disposicion.xml?id_disposicion=69383&amp;desde=min Document covering end of Spanish analogue mobile telephone services] (in Spanish), Ministerio de Industria, Turismo y Comercio (Spain). Article dated 2003-12-19, retrieved 2007-01-28.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] - In areas where AT&amp;T Mobility previously had D-AMPS operating on 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz frequencies, no analog AMPS network existed, and the D-AMPS network on the 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency was shut down in mid-2007. Service on the remaining 850&amp;nbsp;MHz AMPS markets was discontinued along with 850&amp;nbsp;MHz D-AMPS service on February 18, 2008, except in areas where service was provided by [[Dobson Communications]].  The Dobson AMPS and TDMA networks were shut down on March 1, 2008.
* [[Telecom New Zealand]] — Operated an AMPS/TDMA network in New Zealand from 1987 until 2007 throughout the whole country and the network was renowned for its superb coverage, In 2000 Telecom announced that they would discontinue the AMPS network within 5 years (2005) to give customers an opportunity to transition to the CDMA2000 and later 1XRTT technologies that replaced it. They later extended that deadline until 6PM 31March 2007. At approximately 7:15 on March 31, 2007 the AMPS/TDMA network ceased to function.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telecom.co.nz/content/0,2502,200633-1548,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Telstra]] (formerly Telecom Australia) - operated an AMPS network in Australia from February 1987 until the end of 2000.  As part of the introduction of mobile phone competition in Australia, the Australian government mandated GSM as the new standard for mobile networks, and required that Telstra close the AMPS network by 2000.  However, GSM base stations could only serve a limited area.  While this was OK for Europe, it meant that GSM could not cover large, sparsely populated rural areas of Australia cost effectively.  Telstra deployed a CDMA network, which did not suffer this limitation, and while the AMPS network was closed down at the end of 1999 in the major cities, the closure deadline was extended until the end of 2000 in rural areas to ease the transition to CDMA.  The CDMA network has since been replaced by [[Next G|an 850&amp;nbsp;MHz UMTS network]].
* [[SaskTel]] - operated an AMPS network in [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]].  It was the third largest AMPS network, by subscribers, in the world at the time of its turndown.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wirelessintelligence.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  It was officially shutdown site by site starting at 00:00 on January 2, 2010 after twenty-one years of service.  [[SaskTel]] continues to run CDMA and UMTS networks.

[[Image:Airplane vortex edit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A [[vortex]] is created by the passage of an aircraft wing, revealed by smoke. Vortices are one of the many phenomena associated to the study of aerodynamics. The equations of aerodynamics show that the vortex is created by the difference in pressure between the upper and lower surface of the wing. At the end of the wing, the lower surface effectively tries to 'reach over' to the low pressure side, creating rotation and the vortex.]]
'''Aerodynamics''' is a branch of [[Dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] concerned with studying the motion of air, particularly when it interacts with a moving object. Aerodynamics is a subfield of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[gas dynamics]], with much theory shared between them. Aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, with the difference being that gas dynamics applies to all gases. Understanding the motion of air (often called a flow field) around an object enables the calculation of forces and moments acting on the object. Typical properties calculated for a flow field include [[velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]] and [[temperature]] as a function of position and time. By defining a [[control volume]] around the flow field, equations for the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy can be defined and used to solve for the properties. The use of aerodynamics through [[mathematical]] analysis, empirical approximations, [[wind tunnel]] experimentation, and [[computer simulation]]s form the scientific basis for [[heavier than air flight|heavier-than-air flight]].

Aerodynamic problems can be identified in a number of ways. The flow environment defines the first classification criterion. ''External'' aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes. Evaluating the [[lift (force)|lift]] and [[drag (physics)|drag]] on an [[fixed-wing aircraft|airplane]] or the [[shock wave]]s that form in front of the nose of a [[rocket]] are examples of external aerodynamics. ''Internal'' aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects. For instance, internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a [[jet engine]] or through an [[air conditioning]] pipe.

The ratio of the problem's characteristic flow speed to the [[speed of sound]] comprises a second classification of aerodynamic problems. A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound, [[transonic]] if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), [[supersonic]] when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and [[hypersonic]] when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; minimum [[Mach number]]s for hypersonic flow range from 3 to 12.

The influence of [[viscosity]] in the flow dictates a third classification. Some problems may encounter only very small viscous effects on the solution, in which case viscosity can be considered to be negligible. The approximations to these problems are called [[inviscid flow]]s. Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called viscous flows.

==History==
===Early ideas - ancient times to the 17th century===
[[Image:Design for a Flying Machine.jpg|thumb|300px|A drawing of a design for a flying machine by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (c. 1488). This machine was an [[ornithopter]], with flapping wings similar to a bird, first presented in his [[Codex on the Flight of Birds]] in 1505.]]

Images and stories of flight have appeared throughout recorded history,&lt;ref&gt;Don Berliner (1997). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Efr2Ll1OdqMC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Aviation: Reaching for the Sky]''&quot;. The Oliver Press, Inc. p.128. ISBN 1-881508-33-1&lt;/ref&gt; such as the legendary story of [[Icarus]] and [[Daedalus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ovid; Gregory, H. | title=The Metamorphoses | publisher=Signet Classics | year=2001 | isbn=0451527933 | oclc=45393471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although observations of some aerodynamic effects like wind resistance (a.k.a. [[drag (physics)|drag]]) were recorded by the likes of [[Aristotle]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], very little effort was made to develop governing laws for understanding the nature of flight prior to the 17th century.

In 1505, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] wrote the ''[[Codex on the Flight of Birds]]'', one of the earliest treatises on aerodynamics. He notes for the first time that the [[center of gravity]] of a flying bird does not coincide with its [[center of pressure]], and he describes the construction of an [[ornithopter]], with flapping wings similar to a bird's.

[[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] was the first person to develop a theory of air resistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Newton, I. | title=Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Book II | year=1726}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him one of the first aerodynamicists. As part of that theory, Newton believed that drag was due to the dimensions of a body, the density of the fluid, and the velocity [[Exponentiation|raised to the second power]]. These beliefs all turned out to be correct for low flow speeds. Newton also developed a law for the drag force on a flat plate inclined towards the direction of the fluid flow. Using ''F'' for the drag force, ''ρ'' for the density, ''S'' for the area of the flat plate, ''V'' for the flow velocity, and ''θ'' for the inclination angle, his law was expressed as &lt;math&gt;F = \rho SV^2 \sin^2 (\theta) &lt;/math&gt;

Unfortunately, this equation is incorrect for the calculation of drag in most cases. Drag on a flat plate is closer to being linear with the angle of inclination as opposed to acting quadratically at low angles. The Newton formula can lead one to believe that flight is more difficult than it actually is, and it may have contributed to a delay in human flight. However, it is correct for a very slender plate when the angle becomes large and flow separation occurs, or if the flow speed is supersonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=von Karman, Theodore | title=Aerodynamics: Selected Topics in the Light of Their Historical Development | publisher=Dover Publications | year=2004 | isbn=0486434850 | oclc=53900531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern beginnings - 18th to 19th century===
[[Image:Governableparachute.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A drawing of a glider by [[Sir George Cayley]], one of the early attempts at creating an aerodynamic shape.]]

In 1738 The [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[mathematician]] [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published his book ''Hydrodynamica'', in which he first set out the principle, named after him, by which aerodynamic lift may be derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/658890/Hydrodynamica#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Hydrodynamica%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia | title= Hydrodynamica | accessdate=2008-10-30 |publisher= Britannica Online Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Cayley|Sir George Cayley]] is credited as the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight—[[weight]], [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Drag (physics)|drag]], and [[thrust]]—and the relationship between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| quote = Sir George Cayley, born in 1773, is sometimes called the Father of Aviation. A pioneer in his field, he was the first to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight - weight, lift, drag, and thrust and their relationship. He was also the first to build a successful human-carrying glider. Cayley described many of the concepts and elements of the modern airplane and was the first to understand and explain in engineering terms the concepts of lift and thrust.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AerNav123&quot;&gt;''Cayley, George''. &quot;On Aerial Navigation&quot; [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf Part 1], [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf Part 2], [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf Part 3] ''Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy'', 1809-1810. (Via [[NASA]]). [http://invention.psychology.msstate.edu/i/Cayley/Cayley.html Raw text]. Retrieved: 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Cayley believed that the drag on a flying machine must be counteracted by a means of propulsion in order for level flight to occur. Cayley also looked to nature for aerodynamic shapes with low drag. Among the shapes he investigated were the cross-sections of [[trout]]. This may appear counterintuitive, however, the bodies of fish are shaped to produce very low resistance as they travel through water. Their cross-sections are sometimes very close to that of modern low drag [[airfoil]]s.

Air resistance experiments were carried out by investigators throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Drag theories were developed by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=d'Alembert, J. | title=Essai d'une nouvelle theorie de la resistance des fluides | year=1752}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Kirchhoff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kirchhoff, G. | title=Zur Theorie freier Flussigkeitsstrahlen | publisher=Journal fur die reine und angewandte Mathematik (70), 289-298 | year=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rayleigh, Lord | title=On the Resistance of Fluids | publisher=Philosophical Magazine (5)2, 430-441 | year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equations for fluid flow with [[friction]] were developed by [[Claude-Louis Navier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Navier, C. L. M. H. | title=Memoire sur les lois du mouvement des fluides | publisher=Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences (6), 389-416 | year=1823}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Gabriel Stokes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Stokes, G. | title=On the Theories of the Internal Friction of Fluids in Motion | publisher=Transaction of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (8), 287-305 | year=1845}}&lt;/ref&gt; To simulate fluid flow, many experiments involved immersing objects in streams of water or simply dropping them off the top of a tall building. Towards the end of this time period [[Gustave Eiffel]] used his [[Eiffel Tower]] to assist in the drop testing of flat plates.

Of course, a more precise way to measure resistance is to place an object within an artificial, uniform stream of air where the velocity is known. The first person to experiment in this fashion was [[Francis Herbert Wenham]], who in doing so constructed the first [[wind tunnel]] in 1871. Wenham was also a member of the first professional organization dedicated to aeronautics, the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. Objects placed in wind tunnel models are almost always smaller than in practice, so a method was needed to relate small scale models to their real-life counterparts. This was achieved with the invention of the dimensionless [[Reynolds number]] by [[Osborne Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Reynolds, O. | title=An Experimental Investigation of the Circumstances which Determine whether the Motion of Water Shall Be Direct or Sinuous and of the Law of Resistance in Parallel Channels | publisher=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A-174, 935-982 | year=1883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds also experimented with [[Laminar flow|laminar]] to [[Turbulence|turbulent]] flow transition in 1883.

By the late 19th century, two problems were identified before heavier-than-air flight could be realized. The first was the creation of low-drag, high-lift aerodynamic wings. The second problem was how to determine the power needed for sustained flight. During this time, the groundwork was laid down for modern day [[fluid dynamics]] and aerodynamics, with other less scientifically inclined enthusiasts testing various flying machines with little success.

[[Image:WB Wind Tunnel.jpg|thumb|300px|A replica of the [[Wright Brothers]]' [[wind tunnel]] is on display at the Virginia Air and Space Center. Wind tunnels were key in the development and validation of the laws of aerodynamics.]]In 1889, [[Charles Renard]], a French aeronautical engineer, became the first person to reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Renard, C. | title=Nouvelles experiences sur la resistance de l'air | publisher=L'Aeronaute (22) 73-81 | year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renard and German physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] explored the wing loading of birds, eventually concluding that humans could not fly under their own power by attaching wings onto their arms. [[Otto Lilienthal]], following the work of Sir George Cayley, was the first person to become highly successful with glider flights. Lilienthal believed that thin, curved airfoils would produce high lift and low drag.

[[Octave Chanute]] provided a great service to those interested in aerodynamics and flying machines by publishing a book outlining all of the research conducted around the world up to 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Chanute, Octave| title=Progress in Flying Machines | publisher=Dover Publications | year=1997 | isbn=0486299813 | oclc=37782926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practical flight - early 20th century===
With the information contained in Chanute's book, the personal assistance of Chanute himself, and research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the [[Wright brothers]] gained just enough knowledge of aerodynamics to fly the first powered aircraft on December 17, 1903, just in time to beat the efforts of [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]]. The Wright brothers' flight confirmed or disproved a number of aerodynamics theories. Newton's drag force theory was finally proved incorrect. This first widely-publicised flight led to a more organized effort between aviators and scientists, leading the way to modern aerodynamics.

During the time of the first flights, [[Frederick W. Lanchester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lanchester, F. W. | title=Aerodynamics | year=1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Wilhelm Kutta]], and [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]] independently created theories that connected [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, [[Ludwig Prandtl]] is credited with developing the mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Prandtl, L. | title=Tragflügeltheorie | publisher=Göttinger Nachrichten, mathematischphysikalische Klasse, 451-477 | year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with [[boundary layer]]s. Prandtl, a professor at the [[University of Göttingen]], instructed many students who would play important roles in the development of aerodynamics like [[Theodore von Kármán]] and [[Michael Max Munk|Max Munk]].

===Faster than sound - later 20th century===
As aircraft began to travel faster, aerodynamicists realized that the density of air began to change as it came into contact with an object, leading to a division of fluid flow into the incompressible and [[Compressible flow|compressible]] regimes. In compressible aerodynamics, density and pressure both change, which is the basis for calculating the [[speed of sound]]. Newton was the first to develop a mathematical model for calculating the speed of sound, but it was not correct until [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] accounted for the molecular behavior of gases and introduced the [[heat capacity ratio]]. The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the [[Mach number]] after [[Ernst Mach]], who was one of the first to investigate the properties of [[supersonic]] flow which included [[Schlieren photography]] techniques to visualize the changes in density. [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] and [[Pierre Henri Hugoniot]] independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a [[shock wave]]. [[Jakob Ackeret]] led the initial work on calculating the lift and drag on a supersonic airfoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ackeret, J. | title=Luftkrafte auf Flugel, die mit der grosserer als Schallgeschwindigkeit bewegt werden | publisher=Zeitschrift fur Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt (16), 72-74 | year=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore von Kármán and [[Hugh Latimer Dryden]] introduced the term [[transonic]] to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. Because of the increase in drag approaching Mach 1, aerodynamicists and aviators disagreed on whether supersonic flight was achievable.

[[Image:X-43A (Hyper - X) Mach 7 computational fluid dynamic (CFD).jpg|thumb|left|300px|A computer generated model of NASA's [[X-43A]] hypersonic research vehicle flying at Mach 7 using a [[computational fluid dynamics]] code.]]On September 30, 1935 an exclusive conference was held in [[Rome]] with the topic of high velocity flight and the possibility of breaking the [[sound barrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Anderson, John D.| title=Fundamentals of Aerodynamics | publisher=McGraw-Hill | edition=4th |year=2007 | isbn=0071254080 | oclc=60589123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants included [[Theodore von Kármán]], [[Ludwig Prandtl]], [[Jakob Ackeret]], [[Eastman Jacobs]], [[Adolf Busemann]], [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]], [[Gaetano Arturo Crocco]], and Enrico Pistolesi. The new research presented was impressive. Ackeret presented a design for a [[supersonic wind tunnel]]. Busemann gave perhaps the best presentation on the need for aircraft with [[swept wing]]s for high speed flight. Eastman Jacobs, working for [[NACA]], presented his optimized airfoils for high subsonic speeds which led to some of the high performance American aircraft during [[World War II]]. Supersonic propulsion was also discussed. The sound barrier was broken using the [[Bell X-1]] aircraft twelve years later, thanks in part to those individuals.

By the time the sound barrier was broken, much of the subsonic and low supersonic aerodynamics knowledge had matured. The [[Cold War]] fueled an ever evolving line of high performance aircraft. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] was started as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using a computer.

With some exceptions, the knowledge of [[hypersonic]] aerodynamics has matured between the 1960s and the present decade. Therefore, the goals of an aerodynamicist have shifted from understanding the behavior of fluid flow to understanding how to engineer a vehicle to interact appropriately with the fluid flow. For example, while the behavior of hypersonic flow is understood, building a [[scramjet]] aircraft to fly at hypersonic speeds has seen very limited success. Along with building a successful scramjet aircraft, the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems will continue to fuel new research in aerodynamics.

==Introductory terminology==
* [[Lift (force)|Lift]]
* [[Drag (physics)|Drag]]
* [[Reynolds number]]
* [[Mach number]]

==Continuity assumption==
Gases are composed of [[molecule]]s which collide with one another and solid objects. If density and velocity are taken to be well-defined at infinitely small points, and are assumed to vary continuously from one point to another, the discrete molecular nature of a gas is ignored.

The continuity assumption becomes less valid as a gas becomes more rarefied. In these cases, [[statistical mechanics]] is a more valid method of solving the problem than continuous aerodynamics. The [[Knudsen number]] can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.

==Laws of conservation==
[[Image:Conservation for aerodynamics.PNG|thumb|400px|Control volume schematic of internal flow with one inlet and exit including an axial force, work, and heat transfer. State 1 is the inlet and state 2 is the exit.]]
Aerodynamics problems are often solved using [[conservation laws]] as applied to a [[Continuum mechanics|fluid continuum]]. The conservation laws can be written in [[integral]] or [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] form. In many basic problems, three conservation principles are used:
* [[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|Continuity]]: If a certain mass of fluid enters a volume, it must either exit the volume or change the mass inside the volume. In fluid dynamics, the continuity equation is analogous to [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's current law (KCL)|Kirchhoff's Current Law]] in electric circuits. The differential form of the continuity equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\ {\partial \rho \over \partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Above, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid density, '''u''' is a velocity vector, and ''t'' is time. Physically, the equation also shows that mass is neither created nor destroyed in the control volume.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J.D., ''Fundamentals of Aerodynamics'', 4th Ed., McGraw-Hill, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[steady state]] process, the rate at which mass enters the volume is equal to the rate at which it leaves the volume.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J.(1975), ''Aerodynamics'', Section 3.3, Pitman Publishing Limited, London&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the first term on the left is then equal to zero. For flow through a tube with one inlet (state 1) and exit (state 2) as shown in the figure in this section, the continuity equation may be written and solved as:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \rho_{1} u_{1} A_{1} = \rho_{2} u_{2} A_{2} &lt;/math&gt;

Above, ''A'' is the variable cross-section area of the tube at the inlet and exit. For incompressible flows, density remains constant.
* [[Momentum|Conservation of Momentum]]: This equation applies [[Newton's second law of motion]] to a continuum, whereby force is equal to the [[time derivative]] of [[momentum]]. Both [[Surface force|surface]] and [[Body force|body]] forces are accounted for in this equation. For instance, ''F'' could be expanded into an expression for the frictional force acting on an internal flow.

:&lt;math&gt;\ {D \mathbf{u} \over D t} = \mathbf{F} - {\nabla p \over \rho} &lt;/math&gt;

For the same figure, a control volume analysis yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\ p_{1}A_{1} + \rho_{1}A_{1}u_{1}^2 + F = p_{2}A_{2} + \rho_{2}A_{2}u_{2}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Above, the force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is placed on the left side of the equation, assuming it acts with the flow moving in a left-to-right direction. Depending on the other properties of the flow, the resulting force could be negative which means it acts in the opposite direction as depicted in the figure.
* [[Conservation of energy|Conservation of Energy]]: Although [[energy]] can be converted from one form to another, the total [[energy]] in a given system remains constant.

:&lt;math&gt;\ \rho {Dh \over Dt} = {D p \over D t} + \nabla \cdot \left( k \nabla T\right) + \Phi &lt;/math&gt;

Above, ''h'' is [[enthalpy]], ''k'' is the [[thermal conductivity]] of the fluid, ''T'' is temperature, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the viscous dissipation function. The viscous dissipation function governs the rate at which mechanical energy of the flow is converted to heat. The expression on the left side is a [[material derivative]]. The term is always positive since, according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], viscosity cannot add energy to the control volume.&lt;ref&gt;White, F.M., ''Viscous Fluid Flow'', McGraw-Hill, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Again using the figure, the energy equation in terms of the control volume may be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \rho_{1}u_{1}A_{1} \left( h_{1} + {u_{1}^{2} \over 2}\right) + \dot{W} + \dot{Q} = \rho_{2}u_{2}A_{2} \left( h_{2} + {u_{2}^{2} \over 2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Above, the shaft work and heat transfer are assumed to be acting on the flow. They may be positive (to the flow from the surroundings) or negative (to the surroundings from the flow) depending on the problem. The [[ideal gas law]] or another equation of state is often used in conjunction with these equations to form a system to solve for the unknown variables.

==Incompressible aerodynamics==
An [[incompressible flow]] is characterized by a constant density despite flowing over surfaces or inside ducts. A flow can be considered incompressible as long as its speed is low. For higher speeds, the flow will begin to compress as it comes into contact with surfaces. The [[Mach number]] is used to distinguish between incompressible and compressible flows.

===Subsonic flow===
Subsonic (or low-speed) aerodynamics is the study of fluid motion which is everywhere much slower than the speed of sound through the fluid or gas. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is [[inviscid]], [[Compressibility|incompressible]] and [[irrotational]]. This case is called [[Potential flow]] and allows the [[differential equations]] used to be a simplified version of the governing equations of [[fluid dynamics]], thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a special case of Subsonic aerodynamics.

In solving a subsonic problem, one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility. Compressibility is a description of the amount of change of [[density]] in the problem. When the effects of compressibility on the solution are small, the aerodynamicist may choose to assume that density is constant. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the problem is called a compressible problem. In air, compressibility effects are usually ignored when the [[Mach number]] in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102m) per second or 228 miles (366&amp;nbsp;km) per hour at 60&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F). Above 0.3, the problem should be solved by using compressible aerodynamics.

==Compressible aerodynamics==
{{main|Compressible flow}}
According to the theory of aerodynamics, a flow is considered to be compressible if its change in [[density]] with respect to [[pressure]] is non-zero along a [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]. This means that - unlike incompressible flow - changes in density must be considered. In general, this is the case where the [[Mach number]] in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach .3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density with respect to the change in pressure of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the [[stagnation point]] of an object immersed in the gas flow and the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all compressible.

===Transonic flow===
{{main|Transonic}}
The term Transonic refers to a range of velocities just below and above the local [[speed of sound]] (generally taken as [[Mach Number|Mach]] 0.8–1.2). It is defined as the range of speeds between the [[critical mach|critical Mach number]], when some parts of the airflow over an aircraft become [[supersonic]], and a higher speed, typically near [[Mach number|Mach 1.2]], when all of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds some of the airflow is supersonic, and some is not.

===Supersonic flow===
{{main|Supersonic}}
Supersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound. Calculating the lift on the [[Concorde]] during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem.

Supersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow. Fluids react to differences in pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is &quot;told&quot; to respond to its environment. Therefore, since [[sound]] is in fact an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, the [[speed of sound]] in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that &quot;information&quot; can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself in the case of a fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a [[stagnation pressure]] as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid &quot;knows&quot; the object is there and is avoiding it. However, in a supersonic flow, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally does strike the object, it is forced to change its properties -- [[temperature]], [[density]], [[pressure]], and [[Mach number]] -- in an extremely violent and [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible]] fashion called a [[shock wave]]. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-velocity (see [[Reynolds number]]) fluids, is the central difference between supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics problems.

===Hypersonic flow===
{{main|Hypersonic}}
In aerodynamics, hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic. In the 1970s, the term generally came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the speed of sound) and above. The hypersonic regime is a subset of the supersonic regime. Hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.

==Associated terminology==
The incompressible and compressible flow regimes produce many associated phenomena, such as boundary layers and turbulence.

===Boundary layers===
{{main|Boundary layer}}
The concept of a [[boundary layer]] is important in many aerodynamic problems. The viscosity and fluid friction in the air is approximated as being significant only in this thin layer. This principle makes aerodynamics much more tractable mathematically.

===Turbulence===
{{main|Turbulence}}
In aerodynamics, turbulence is characterized by chaotic, stochastic property changes in the flow. This includes low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and velocity in space and time. Flow that is not turbulent is called laminar flow.

==Aerodynamics in other fields==
'''{{further|[[Automotive aerodynamics]]}}
Aerodynamics is important in a number of applications other than aerospace engineering. '''
It is a significant factor in any type of [[Automotive engineering|vehicle design]], including [[automobile]]s. It is important in the prediction of forces and moments in [[sailing]]. It is used in the design of large components such as [[hard drive]] heads. [[Structural engineering|Structural engineers]] also use aerodynamics, and particularly [[aeroelasticity]], to calculate [[wind]] loads in the design of large buildings and [[bridge]]s. Urban aerodynamics seeks to help [[Urban planning|town planners]] and designers improve comfort in outdoor spaces, create urban microclimates and reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics studies the ways [[atmospheric circulation]] and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. The aerodynamics of internal passages is important in [[HVAC|heating/ventilation]], [[Duct (HVAC)|gas piping]], and in [[Internal combustion engine|automotive engines]] where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.

'''Andreas Schlüter''' (20 May 1664 &amp;ndash; May 1714) was a [[Germans|German]] [[baroque]] [[sculptor]] and [[architect]] associated with the [[Petrine Baroque]] style of architecture and decoration.

==Biography==
Andreas Schlüter was born in [[Hamburg]]&lt;ref&gt;''nach älteren Quellen angeblich am 20. Mai 1664 in Hamburg als Sohn des Bildhauers Gerhart Schlüter geboren'' - [http://mdz10.bib-bvb.de/~db/bsb00008413/images/index.html?seite=187 ''Andreas Schlüter''], in: [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]] (ADB). Bd. 55, Leipzig 1910, S. 184–194.&lt;/ref&gt;  His early life is obscure as at least three different persons of that name are documented. The records of [[St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg]] show that an Andreas Schlüter, son of sculptor Gerhart Schlüter, had been baptized there on 22 May 1664. Documents from &lt;!-- &quot;In biographies of clearly German persons, the name should be used in the form Danzig (Gdańsk) and later Danzig exclusively&quot;. Do not add anything else! --&gt; [[History of Gdańsk|Danzig]] (Gdańsk) &lt;!-- &quot;In biographies of clearly German persons, the name should be used in the form Danzig (Gdańsk) and later Danzig exclusively&quot;. Do not add anything else! --&gt; reported that an Andreas Schlüter ''(senior)'' had worked 1640-1652 in Danzig's Jopengasse lane (today's ulica Piwna). Possibly born in 1640, an ''Andres Schliter'' is recorded as apprentice on 9 May 1656 by the mason's guild. Other sources state 1659 as year of birth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]] online article on [[Zeughaus]] [http://www.dhm.de/magazine/zeughaus/Skulpturenschmuck.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

He probably did spend several years abroad as [[Journeyman]]. His first work, in 1675, may have been epitaphs of the Dukes [[Sambor]] and [[Mestwin]] in the dome of [[Pelplin monastery]].

Schlüter's first known work was the decoration of the [[facade]] of the St. Johannis Chapel, or Danzig Royal Chapel, in 1681. He later created statues for King [[John III Sobieski]]'s [[Wilanów Palace]] in [[Warsaw]] and sepulchral sculptures in [[Zhovkva Castle|Żółkiew (Zhovkva)]]. In 1689, he moved to Warsaw and made the [[pediment]] reliefs and sculptural work of [[Jan Dobrogost Krasiński|Krasiński Palace]].

[[File:Kikin.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Kikin Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] is often attributed to Schlüter, although there is no proof of his authorship]]

Schlüter was invited to [[Berlin]] in 1694 by [[Eberhard von Danckelmann]] to work as court sculptor at the [[Zeughaus|armory (''Zeughaus'')]] for Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III]]. His sculpted decorations are a masterpiece of baroque expression and [[pathos]]. While the more visible reliefs on the outside had to praise fighting, the statues of dying warriors in the interior denounced war and gave an indication of his pacifist religious beliefs (he is said to have been a [[Mennonite]]). Travelling through Italy in 1696, he studied the work of masters like [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] und [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].

Schlüter also worked as an architect and built many state buildings in Berlin in his role as &quot;Hofbaumeister&quot; (Court Architect), which he lost when one tower showed signs of a weak fundament. He also served as director of the [[Akademie der Künste]] from 1702 to 1704, after which he began concentrating on sculpting again, as &quot;Hofbildhauer&quot; (Court Sculptor). His most important [[equestrian sculpture]] is that of the &quot;Great Elector&quot;, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William of Brandenburg]], cast in 1708 and placed at &quot;Lange Brücke&quot; near the [[Berlin City Palace]], now situated in the honor court before [[Charlottenburg Palace]].

The Berlin City Palace, and many of his works, were partially destroyed by bombing in [[World War II]] and by the subsequent [[German Democratic Republic|Communist regime]]. A similar fate probably befell the [[Amber Room]], made between 1701 and 1709, Schlüter's most famous work of architecture.

In 1713 Schlüter's fame brought him to work for Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], where he died of an illness after creating several designs. Together with [[Johann Friedrich Braunstein]], he designed the Grand Palace and [[Monplaisir]] Palace in [[Petergof|Peterhof]]. Also the city's oldest building, Kikin's Palace, and the reliefs at the [[Summer Palace (Saint Petersburg)|Summer Palace]] are attributed to him.

[[Image:Slope Field.png|thumb|The [[slope field]] of ''ƒ''(''x'') = (x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3)-(x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2)-x+c, showing three of the infinitely many solutions that can be produced by varying the [[Constant of integration|arbitrary constant]] ''C''.]]

In [[calculus]], an '''&quot;anti-derivative&quot;''', '''antiderivative''', '''primitive [[integral]]''' or '''indefinite [[integral]]'''&lt;ref&gt;

Antiderivatives are also called '''general integrals''', and sometimes '''integrals'''. The latter term is generic, and refers not only to indefinite integrals (antiderivatives), but also to [[integral|definite integrals]]. When the word integral is used without additional specification, the reader is supposed to deduce from the context whether it is referred to a definite or indefinite integral. Some authors define the indefinite integral of a function as the set of its infinitely many possible antiderivatives. Others define it as an arbitrarily selected element of that set. Wikipedia adopts the latter approach.
&lt;/ref&gt;
of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' is a function ''F'' whose [[derivative]] is equal to ''f'', i.e., ''F'' ′ = ''f''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=6th | year=2008 | isbn=0-495-01166-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Larson | first1=Ron | authorlink=Ron Larson (mathematician)| last2=Edwards | first2=Bruce H. | title=Calculus | publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=9th | year=2009 | isbn=0-547-16702-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of solving for antiderivatives is called '''antidifferentiation''' (or '''indefinite integration''') and its opposite function is called differentiation, which is the process of finding a [[derivative]]. Antiderivatives are related to [[integral|definite integral]]s through the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]: the definite integral of a function over an interval is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval.

The discrete equivalent of the notion of antiderivative is [[antidifference]].

== Rules and formulas ==
'''Antidifferentiation''' is the process of finding the set of all antiderivatives of a given function. The symbol &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \int&lt;/math&gt; denotes the operation of antidifferentiation

:&lt;math&gt;\int f(x) \,dx = F(x) + C&lt;/math&gt;

::where

:&lt;math&gt;F'\!(x) =\frac {d}{dx} F(x) = f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The expression ''F''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''C'' is the '''general antiderivative''' of ''ƒ''. The constant ''C'' is used because the derivative of a constant is always&amp;nbsp;0.  The notation ''C'' should be understood to mean a quantity that is constant on every connected interval within the domain separately, but not necessarily constant on the whole domain.  For example

: &lt;math&gt; \int \frac{1}{x^3}\;dx = -\frac{1}{2x^2} + \begin{cases} \text{one constant} &amp; \text{for }x &gt; 0, \\  \text{another constant} &amp; \text{for }x &lt; 0.\end{cases}  &lt;/math&gt;

Because antidifferentiation is the inverse operation of the differentiation, antidifferentiation theorems and rules are obtained from those on differentiation. Thus, the following theorems can be proven from the corresponding differentiation theorems:

*General antidifferentiation rule:
::&lt;math&gt;\int dx = x +C&lt;/math&gt;

*The general antiderivative of a constant times a function is the constant multiplied by the general antiderivative of the function:
::&lt;math&gt;\int af(x) \,dx = a \int f(x)\, dx +C&lt;/math&gt;

*If ''ƒ'' and ''g'' are defined on the same interval, then the general antiderivative of the sum of ''ƒ'' and ''g'' equals the sum of the general antiderivatives of ''ƒ'' and ''g'':
::&lt;math&gt;\int [f(x) + g(x)] \,dx = \int f(x) \,dx + \int g(x)\, dx +C&lt;/math&gt;

*If ''n'' is a real number,
::&lt;math&gt;
\int x^n\, dx = 
\begin{cases} 
  \frac {x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C,  &amp; \text{if }n \ne -1 \\[6pt]
  \ln |x| + C, &amp; \text{if }n = -1
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

{{Main|Lists of integrals}}

==Example==
The function ''F''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3 is an antiderivative of ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. As the derivative of a [[Constant function|constant]] is [[0 (number)|zero]], ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; will have an [[infinity|infinite]] number of antiderivatives; such as (''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0, (''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7,  (''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3)&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;42, (''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;293 etc. Thus, all the antiderivatives of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be obtained by changing the value of C in ''F''(''x'') =&amp;nbsp;(''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''C''; where ''C'' is an arbitrary constant known as the [[Arbitrary constant of integration|constant of integration]]. Essentially, the [[graph of a function|graphs]] of antiderivatives of a given function are [[vertical translation]]s of each other; each graph's location depending upon the [[Value (mathematics)|value]] of&amp;nbsp;''C''.

==Uses and properties==
Antiderivatives are important because they can be used to [[integral#Computing integrals|compute definite integrals]], using the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]: if ''F'' is an antiderivative of the [[Riemann integral|integrable]] function ''f'', then:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

Because of this, each of the infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function ''f'' is sometimes called the &quot;general integral&quot; or &quot;indefinite integral&quot; of ''f'' and is written using the integral symbol with no bounds:
:&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''F'' is an antiderivative of ''f'', and the function ''f'' is defined on some [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], then every other antiderivative ''G'' of ''f'' differs from ''F'' by a constant: there exists a number ''C'' such that ''G''(''x'') = ''F''(''x'') + ''C'' for all ''x''.  ''C'' is called the [[arbitrary constant of integration]]. If the domain of ''F'' is a [[disjoint union]] of two or more intervals, then a different constant of integration may be chosen for each of the intervals. For instance

:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=\begin{cases}-\frac{1}{x}+C_1\quad x&lt;0\\-\frac{1}{x}+C_2\quad x&gt;0\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

is the most general antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=1/x^2&lt;/math&gt; on its natural domain &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty).&lt;/math&gt;

Every [[continuous function]] ''f'' has an antiderivative, and one antiderivative ''F'' is given by the definite integral of ''f'' with variable upper boundary:
:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=\int_0^x f(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;
Varying the lower boundary produces other antiderivatives (but not necessarily all possible antiderivatives).  This is another formulation of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. 

There are many functions whose antiderivatives, even though they exist, cannot be expressed in terms of [[elementary function]]s (like [[polynomial]]s, [[exponential function]]s, [[logarithm]]s, [[trigonometric functions]], [[inverse trigonometric functions]] and their combinations).  Examples of these are 
:&lt;math&gt;\int e^{-x^2}\,dx,\qquad \int \frac{\sin(x)}{x}\,dx,\qquad \int\frac{1}{\ln x}\,dx,\qquad \int x^{x}\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[differential Galois theory]] for a more detailed discussion.

== Techniques of integration ==

Finding antiderivatives of elementary functions is often considerably harder than finding their derivatives.  For some elementary functions, it is impossible to find an antiderivative in terms of other elementary functions.  See the article on [[Elementary function (differential algebra)|elementary functions]] for further information.

We have various methods at our disposal:  

* the [[linearity of integration]] allows us to break complicated integrals into simpler ones
* [[integration by substitution]], often combined with [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]] or the [[natural logarithm]]
* [[integration by parts]] to integrate products of functions
* the [[inverse chain rule method]], a special case of integration by substitution
* the method of [[partial fractions in integration]] allows us to integrate all [[rational function]]s (fractions of two polynomials)
* the [[Risch algorithm]]
* integrals can also be looked up in a [[table of integrals]]
* when integrating multiple times, we can use certain additional techniques, see for instance [[double integral]]s and [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]], the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] and the [[Stokes' theorem]]
* [[computer algebra system]]s can be used to automate some or all of the work involved in the symbolic techniques above, which is particularly useful when the algebraic manipulations involved are very complex or lengthy
* if a function has no elementary antiderivative (for instance, exp(-''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)), its definite integral can be approximated using [[numerical integration]]
* to calculate the (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times) repeated antiderivative of a function &lt;math&gt;f,&lt;/math&gt;   [[Cauchy]]'s formula is useful (cf. [[Cauchy formula for repeated integration]]):
::&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_0}^x \int_{x_0}^{x_1} \dots \int_{x_0}^{x_{n-1}} f(x_n) \,dx_n \dots \, d x_2\, d x_1= \int_{x_0}^x f(t) \frac{(x-t)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}\,dt .&lt;/math&gt;

== Antiderivatives of non-continuous functions ==

Non-continuous functions can have antiderivatives. While there are still open questions in this area, it is known that:
* Some highly [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological functions]] with large sets of discontinuities may nevertheless have antiderivatives.
* In some cases, the antiderivatives of such pathological functions may be found by [[Riemann integral|Riemann integration]], while in other cases these functions are not Riemann integrable.

Assuming that the domains of the functions are open intervals:
* A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a function ''f'' to have an antiderivative is that ''f'' have the [[intermediate value theorem|intermediate value property]]. That is, if [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] is a subinterval of the domain of ''f'' and ''d'' is any real number between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b''), then ''f''(''c'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''d'' for some ''c'' between ''a'' and ''b''. To see this, let ''F'' be an antiderivative of ''f'' and consider the continuous function ''g''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''F''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''dx'' on the closed interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']. Then ''g'' must have either a maximum or minimum ''c'' in the open interval (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') and so 0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''g''′(''c'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(''c'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''d''.
* The set of discontinuities of ''f'' must be a [[Baire space#Historical definition|meagre set]]. This set must also be an [[F-sigma]] set (since the set of discontinuities of any function must be of this type).  Moreover for any meagre F-sigma set, one can construct some function ''f'' having an antiderivative, which has the given set as its set of discontinuities.
* If ''f'' has an antiderivative, is [[bounded function|bounded]] on closed finite subintervals of the domain and has a set of discontinuities of [[Lebesgue measure]] 0, then an antiderivative may be found by integration.
* If ''f'' has an antiderivative ''F'' on a closed interval [''a'',''b''], then for any choice of partition &lt;math&gt;a=x_0&lt;x_1&lt;x_2&lt;\dots&lt;x_n=b&lt;/math&gt;, if one chooses sample points &lt;math&gt;x_i^*\in[x_{i-1},x_i]&lt;/math&gt; as specified by the [[mean value theorem]], then the corresponding Riemann sum [[telescoping series|telescopes]] to the value ''F''(''b'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''F''(''a'').

&amp; = F(x_n)-F(x_0) = F(b)-F(a)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:However if  ''f''  is unbounded, or if  ''f''  is bounded but the set of discontinuities of ''f'' has positive Lebesgue measure, a different choice of sample points &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; may give a significantly different value for the Riemann sum, no matter how fine the partition. See Example 4 below.

=== Some examples ===

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=2x\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)-\cos\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;f\left(0\right)=0&lt;/math&gt; is not continuous at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; but has the antiderivative

:&lt;math&gt;F\left(x\right)=x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

 with &lt;math&gt;F\left(0\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''f'' is bounded on closed finite intervals and is only discontinuous at 0, the antiderivative ''F'' may be obtained by integration: &lt;math&gt;F(x)=\int_0^x f(t)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The function 

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=2x\sin\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)-\frac{2}{x}\cos\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;f\left(0\right)=0&lt;/math&gt; is not continuous at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; but has the antiderivative 

:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;F\left(0\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Unlike Example 1, ''f''(''x'') is unbounded in any interval containing 0, so the Riemann integral is undefined.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; If ''f''(''x'') is the function in Example 1 and ''F'' is its antiderivative, and &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[dense set|dense]] [[countable]] subset of the open interval &lt;math&gt;\left(-1,1\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then the function 

:&lt;math&gt;g(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{f(x-x_n)}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;

has an antiderivative 

:&lt;math&gt;G(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{F(x-x_n)}{2^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The set of discontinuities of ''g'' is precisely the set &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''g'' is bounded on closed finite intervals and the set of discontinuities has measure 0, the antiderivative ''G'' may be found by integration.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[dense set|dense]] [[countable]] subset of the open interval &lt;math&gt;\left(-1,1\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Consider the everywhere continuous strictly increasing function 

:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{2^n}(x-x_n)^{1/3}.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that 

:&lt;math&gt;F'(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{3\cdot2^n}(x-x_n)^{-2/3}&lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:antideriv1.gif|125px|right|thumb|Figure 1.]] 
[[Image:antideriv2.gif|thumb|right|125px|Figure 2.]] 

for all values ''x'' where the series converges, and that the graph of ''F''(''x'') has vertical tangent lines at all other values of ''x''. In particular the graph has vertical tangent lines at all points in the set &lt;math&gt;\{x_n\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Moreover &lt;math&gt;F\left(x\right)\ge0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' where the derivative is defined. It follows that the inverse function &lt;math&gt;G=F^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable everywhere and that 

:&lt;math&gt;g\left(x\right)=G'\left(x\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'' in the set &lt;math&gt;\{F(x_n)\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt; which is dense in the interval &lt;math&gt;\left[F\left(-1\right),F\left(1\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;. Thus ''g'' has an antiderivative ''G''. On the other hand, it can not be true that 

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{F(-1)}^{F(1)}g(x)\,dx=GF(1)-GF(-1)=2,&lt;/math&gt;

since for any partition of &lt;math&gt;\left[F\left(-1\right),F\left(1\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;, one can choose sample points for the Riemann sum from the set &lt;math&gt;\{F(x_n)\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt;, giving a value of 0 for the sum. It follows that ''g'' has a set of discontinuities of positive Lebesgue measure. Figure 1 on the right shows an approximation to the graph of ''g''(''x'') where &lt;math&gt;\{x_n=\cos(n)\}_{n\ge1}&lt;/math&gt; and the series is truncated to 8 terms. Figure 2 shows the graph of an approximation to the antiderivative ''G''(''x''), also truncated to 8 terms. On the other hand if the Riemann integral is replaced by the [[Lebesgue integral]], then [[Fatou's lemma]] or the [[dominated convergence theorem]] shows that ''g'' does satisfy the fundamental theorem of calculus in that context.
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In Examples 3 and 4, the sets of discontinuities of the functions ''g'' are dense only in a finite open interval &lt;math&gt;\left(a,b\right)&lt;/math&gt;. However these examples can be easily modified so as to have  sets of discontinuities which are dense on the entire real line &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. Let
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(x) = \frac{a+b}{2} + \frac{b-a}{\pi}\tan^{-1}(x).&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;g\left(\lambda(x)\right)\lambda'(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a dense set of discontinuities on  &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and has antiderivative &lt;math&gt;G\cdot\lambda.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Using a similar method as in Example 5, one can modify ''g'' in Example 4 so as to vanish at all [[rational numbers]]. If one uses a naive version of the [[Riemann integral]] defined as the limit of left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums over regular partitions, one will obtain that the integral of such a function ''g'' over an interval &lt;math&gt;\left[a,b\right]&lt;/math&gt; is 0 whenever ''a'' and ''b'' are both rational, instead of &lt;math&gt;G\left(b\right)-G\left(a\right)&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus the fundamental theorem of calculus will fail spectacularly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2008}}
An '''alphabet song''' is any of various songs used to teach children an [[alphabet]], used in [[kindergarten]]s, [[pre-school]]s and homes around the world. Alphabet songs typically follow the [[alphabetic principle]] (though the [[phonics]] method offers variants). In languages such as [[English language|English]] with [[morphophonemic]] variation, an alphabet song usually chooses a particular [[pronunciation]] for each letter in the alphabet (i.e. &quot;c'''a'''ke&quot; is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|k}}, not {{IPA|[ˈkaːkɛ]}}) and also typically for some words in the song.

== The A.B.C. ==
&quot;The A.B.C.&quot; ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|eɪ|ˌ|b|iː|ˈ|s|iː}}) or &quot;A.B.C's&quot; ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|eɪ|ˌ|b|iː|ˈ|s|iː|z}}) is one of the best-known [[English language]] alphabet songs, and perhaps the one most frequently referred to as &quot;the alphabet song&quot;, especially in the [[United States]].
[[Image:Alphabet song.png|thumb|250px|right|Music for the alphabet song including some common variations on the lyrics]]
{{Listen|filename=Alphabet song.ogg|title=Alphabet song|description=Tune for ''Alphabet song''}}
The song was first copyrighted in 1835 by the [[Boston]]-based music publisher [[Charles Bradlee]], and given the title &quot;The A.B.C., a German air with variations for the flute with an easy accompaniment for the piano forte&quot;. The musical arrangement was attributed to [[Louis Le Maire]] (sometimes Lemaire), an 18th century composer. This was &quot;Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1835, by C. Bradlee, in the clerk's office of the District Court of Massachusetts&quot;, according to the Newberry Library,&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First  Newberry Library catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; which also says, &quot;The theme is that used by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] for his [[Twelve Variations on &quot;Ah vous dirai-je, Maman&quot;|piano variations, Ah, vous dirai-je, maman]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The alphabet song is sometimes said to come from another of Bradlee's publications, &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot;, but the first line of that song is given as &quot;Come, come my children, I must see&quot;, in [http://orbis.library.yale.edu [[Yale University]]'s library catalog].  It is described as &quot;a favorite glee for three voices, as sung at the Salem glee club.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This tune is more commonly recognizable as &quot;[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]&quot;.

Lyrics: ''(each line represents two measures, or eight beats)''
:''a-b-c-d-e-f-g,'' ({{IPA|/eɪ biː siː diː iː ɛf dʒiː,/}})
:''h-i-j-k-lmnop,'' ({{IPA|/eɪtʃ aɪ dʒeɪ keɪ ɛlɛmɛnoʊ piː,/}} l-m-n-o spoken twice as quickly as rest of rhyme)
:''q-r-s, t-u-v,'' ({{IPA|/kjuː ɑr ɛs, tiː juː viː,/}} pause between s and t)
:''w--x, y-and-z,'' ({{IPA|/dʌbɨjuː ɛks, waɪ, ziː,/}} pause between x and y, w and x last for two beats)
:''Now I know my ABCs;'' ({{IPA|/naʊ aɪ noʊ maɪ eɪ biː siːz,/}})
:''next time won't you sing with me?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evaeaston.com/pr/media/r/alpha-song.ra |format=[[RealPlayer]]|title=Listen to the song sung |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928033936/http://evaeaston.com/pr/media/r/alpha-song.ra |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA|/nɛkst taɪm woʊnt juː sɪŋ wɪθ miː/}}).

=== Zed for Zee ===
In the [[United States]], [[Z]] is pronounced ''zee''; in most other English-speaking countries it is pronounced ''zed''.  Generally the absent ''zee''-rhyme is not missed, although some children use a ''zee'' pronunciation in the rhyme which they would not use elsewhere. Variants of the song exist to accommodate the ''zed'' pronunciation.  One variation shortens the second line and lengthens the last, to form a near-rhyme between [[N]] and zed:

:''a-b-c-d-e-f-g''
:''h-i-j-k-lmnop''
:''q-r-s''
:''t-u-v''
:''w-x''
:''y and zee''
:''Now I know my &quot;ABCs&quot;,''
:''Next time won't you sing with me''

In UK ([[Nursery Rhymes]]):

:''a-b-c-d-e-f-g''
:''h-i-j-k-lmnop''
:''q-r-s-t-u-v-w''
:''x-y-zed''
:''Now I know my &quot;ABCs&quot;''
:''Next time won't you sing with me''

Other variants make significantly more changes in order to rhyme with zed, and even alter the rest of the song to fit a new rhythm. For example:
:''a-b-c-d-e-f-g''
:''h-i-j-k-lmnop''
:''lmnop-q-r-s-t''
:''u-v-w-x-y-zed''
:''x-y-zed''
:''Sugar on your bread''
:''Eat it all up''
:''Before you go to bed.''

== Phonics ==
This alphabet song, sung to a different melody from that of the previous, is taught by some pre-schools that use the [[phonics]] method.

:''What does the A say?  Ay Aa Ah''{{Clarify|date=August 2009}} (the vowels are sounded completely)
:''What does the B say?  B* B* B*'' (only the leading sound of consonants are sung in the response part)
:''What does the C say?  S* and K*''
:''What does the D say?  D* D* D*''
:''What does the E say?  Ee and Eh''
:. . .
(continue for each letter with several slightly different melodies)
:. . .
:''What does the X say?  Cs Cs Cs''
:''What does the Y say?  Yuh* Ee* Eye*''
:''What does the Z say?  Zzz Zzz Zzz''

:''What do you call these phones and sounds?''
:''English alphabet letters.''
:''Yeah!''

This song teaches children that each letter has a name and sounds. Just like a [[dog]] says &quot;woof&quot; and a [[cat]] says &quot;meow&quot;, the &quot;I&quot; says &quot;eye&quot; and &quot;ee&quot;.

== Acrostic songs ==
There are also songs that go through the alphabet, making each letter stand for something in the process. One example was recorded in 1948, by [[Buddy Kaye]], [[Fred Wise (lyricist)|Fred Wise]], [[Sidney Lippman]], and later [[Perry Como]], called ''[['A' — You're Adorable]]'':

:''A, you're adorable''
:''B, you're so beautiful''
:''C, you're a cutie full of charms''
:''D, you're a darling''
:''And E, you're exciting''
:''And F, you're a feather in my arms''
:''G, you look good to me''
:''H, you're so heavenly''
:''I, you're the one I idolize''
:''J, we're like Jack and Jill''
:''K, you're so kissable''
:''L, is the love light in your eyes''
:''M, N, O, P''
:''I could go on all day''
:''Q, R, S, T''
:''Alphabetically speaking: &quot;You're OK&quot;''
:''U, made my life complete''
:''V, means you're very sweet''
:''W, X, Y, Z''
:''It's fun to wander through the alphabet with you to tell you what you mean to me''

== Backwards song ==
The group [[Wee Sing]] released an alphabet song with the letters in reverse order.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} It is called ZYXs. It goes as follows:

:''Z-Y-X-W-V-and-U--''
:''T-and-S-and-R-and-Q--''
:''P-O-N-M-L-K-J--,''
:''I-H-G-F-EDCBA--'' (EDCBA said like LMNOP in alphabet song)
:''Now I know my ZYXs''
:''Next time we'll sing down in [[Texas]]''

The Canadian children's TV series ''[[The Big Comfy Couch]]'' used a version of the song in the episode &quot;Backwards&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Comedian [[Soupy Sales]] released a song in 1966 called &quot;Backwards Alphabet&quot; which contained the reverse alphabet in lyrical style.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The '''Antigonid dynasty''' (Greek: Δυναστεία των Αντιγονιδών) was a dynasty of [[Hellenistic]] kings descended from [[Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's]] general [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]] (&quot;the One-eyed&quot;).

==History==

Succeeding the [[Antipatrid dynasty]] in much of Macedonia, Antigonus ruled mostly over Asia Minor and northern Syria.  His attempts to take control of the whole of Alexander's empire led to his defeat and death at the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in 301 BC. Antigonus's son [[Demetrius I Poliorcetes]] survived the battle, and managed to seize control of [[Macedon]] itself a few years later, but eventually lost his throne, dying in prison. After a period of confusion, Demetrius's son [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] was able to establish the family's control over the old Kingdom of Macedon, as well as over most of the Greek city-states, by 276 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = J.

==Legacy==

It was one of four dynasties established by Alexander's successors, the others being the [[Seleucid dynasty]], [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] and [[Attalid dynasty]]. The last scion of the dynasty, [[Perseus of Macedon]], who reigned between 179-168 BCE, was recognized as a champion of [[Greeks|Greek]] freedom against [[Ancient Roman Empire|Rome]]. Nonetheless he proved unable to stop the advancing Roman legions and the Greeks' defeat at the [[Battle of Pydna]] signaled the end of the dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;'''Britannica''', ''Antigonid dynasty'', 2008, O.Ed. &quot;Philip’s successor, Perseus (reigned 179–168 bc), was recognized as a champion of Greek freedom against Rome. But Perseus’ failure to deploy his full resources brought about his defeat (168) at Pydna in Macedonia and signaled the end of the dynasty.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abjuration''' is the solemn repudiation, abandonment, or renunciation by or upon [[oath]], often the renunciation of [[citizenship]] or some other [[right]] or [[privilege]]. (It comes from the [[Latin]] ''abjurare'', &quot;to forswear&quot;).

==Abjuration of the realm==

'''Abjuration of the realm''' was a type of abjuration in ancient [[English law]]. The person taking the oath swore to leave the country directly and promptly never to return to the kingdom unless by permission of the sovereign. This was often taken by fugitives who had taken [[sanctuary]]: 

{{quote|
I swear on the Holy Book that I will leave the realm of England and never return without the express permission of my Lord the King or his heirs. I will hasten by the direct road to the port allotted to me and not leave the King's highway under pain of arrest or execution. I will not stay at one place more than one night and will seek diligently for a passage across the sea as soon as I arrive, delaying only one tide if possible. If I cannot secure such passage, I will walk into the sea up to my knees every day as a token of my desire to cross. And if I fail in all this, then peril shall be my lot.
}}

==English Commonwealth==
Near the start of the [[English Civil War]], on 18 August 1643 Parliament passed an &quot;An Ordinance for Explanation of a former Ordinance for Sequestration of Delinquents Estates with some Enlargements.&quot; The enlargements included an oath which became known as the &quot;Oath of Abjuration&quot;:
{{quote|I ..; Do abjure and renounce the Popes Supremacy and Authority over the Catholick Church in General, and over my self in Particular; And I do believe that there is not any Transubstantiation in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, or in the Elements of Bread and Wine after Consecration thereof, by any Person whatsoever; And I do also believe, that there is not any Purgatory, Or that the consecrated Hoast, Crucifixes, or Images, ought to be worshipped, or that any worship is due unto any of them; And I also believe that Salvation cannot be Merited by Works, and all Doctrines in affirmation of the said Points; I do abjure and renounce, without any Equivocation, Mental Reservation, or secret Evasion whatsoever, taking the words by me spoken, according to the common and usual meaning of them. So help me God.|
&lt;ref&gt;C.H. Firth, R.S. Rait (editors  (1911)). ''Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660'', &quot;August 1643: An Ordinance for Explanation of a former Ordinance for Sequestration of Delinquents Estates with some Enlargements&quot;, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=55851 pp. 254-260].  Date accessed: 16 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1656, it was reissued in what was for Catholics an even more objectionable form. Everyone was to be &quot;adjudged a Papist&quot; who refused this oath, and the consequent penalties began with the confiscation of two thirds of the recusant's goods, and went on to deprive him of almost every civic right.&lt;ref name=CE-attribution&gt;{{catholic|inline=1|wstitle=English Post-Reformation Oaths}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The [[Catholic Encyclopaedia]] make the point that the oath and the penalties were so severe that it stopped the efforts of the [[Gallicanism|gallicanizing party]] among the English Catholics, who had been ready to offer forms of submission similar to the old oath of Allegiance, which was condemned anew about this time by Pope [[Innocent X]].&lt;ref name=CE-attribution/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=English Post-Reformation Oaths}} Cites Reusch, ''Index der verboten Bücher'' (Bonn, 1883)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Britain==
In [[England]], an oath of abjuration was taken by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|members of Parliament]], clergy, and laymen, pledging to support the current [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] and repudiated the right of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] and other claimants to the throne. This oath was imposed under [[William III of England|William III]], [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. It was superseded by the [[oath of allegiance]].

==The Netherlands==
Another famous abjuration was brought about by the [[Act of Abjuration|Plakkaat van Verlatinghe]] of July 26, 1581, the formal [[declaration of independence]] of the [[Low Countries]] from the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish king]], [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. This oath was the climax of the [[Eighty Years' War]] (Dutch Revolt).

[[Image:Vindication1b.jpg|200px|right|thumb|alt=Page reads &quot;A VINDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN: WITH STRICUTRES ON POLITICAL AND MORAL SUBJECTS. BY MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT. PRINTED AT BOSTON, BY PETER EDES FOR THOMAS AND ANDREWS, Faust's Statue, No. 45, Newbury-Street, MDCCXCII.&quot;|Title page from the first American edition of ''Rights of Woman'']]
'''''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects''''' ([[1792 in literature|1792]]), written by the 18th-century British [[feminist]] [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], is one of the earliest works of [[feminist philosophy]]. In it, Wollstonecraft responds to those educational and political theorists of the 18th century who did not believe women should have an education. She argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be &quot;companions&quot; to their husbands, rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men.

Wollstonecraft was prompted to write the ''Rights of Woman'' after reading [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord's]] 1791 report to the French [[National Constituent Assembly|National Assembly]], which stated that women should only receive a domestic education; she used her commentary on this specific event to launch a broad attack against sexual double standards and to indict men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the ''Rights of Woman'' hurriedly in order to respond directly to ongoing events; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it.

While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal. Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her. Although it is commonly assumed now that the ''Rights of Woman'' was unfavourably received, this is a modern misconception based on the belief that Wollstonecraft was as reviled during her lifetime as she became after the publication of [[William Godwin|William Godwin's]] ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1798). The ''Rights of Woman'' was actually well-received when it was first published in 1792. One biographer has called it &quot;perhaps the most original book of [Wollstonecraft's] century&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
[[Image:Talleyrand 01.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Portrait of a man, showing his head and shoulders. He is wearing a black jacket with a high-necked collar and a white shirt tied in a bow. His head is adorned by a curly blonde wig.|[[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]], by [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]]]]
''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' was written against the tumultuous background of the [[French Revolution]] and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the ''[[Revolution Controversy]]'', British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the separation of church and state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'', a response to [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790).&lt;ref name=MS1112&gt;Macdonald and Scherf, &quot;Introduction&quot;, 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Reflections'', Burke criticized the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) in which [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In ''Reflections'' he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilization is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's ''Rights of Men'', published just six weeks after Burke's ''Reflections'', is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] presented his ''Rapport sur l'instruction publique'' (1791) to the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in France, Wollstonecraft was galvanized to respond.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 107; Sapiro, 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; In his recommendations for a national system of education, Talleyrand had written:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let us bring up women, not to aspire to advantages which the Constitution denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees them&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Men are destined to live on the stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.&lt;ref&gt;Talleyrand, &quot;Rapport sur l'instruction publique&quot;, reprinted in ''Vindications'', 394–95.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Marie-Olympe-de-Gouges.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Portrait of a woman, showing her head, with a gray wig. Two large curls are sitting at the nape of her neck. Her shoulders are covered with a filmy, cream-colored shawl.|[[Olympe de Gouges]]]]
Wollstonecraft dedicated the ''Rights of Woman'' to Talleyrand: &quot;Having read with great pleasure a pamphlet which you have lately published, I dedicate this volume to you; to induce you to reconsider the subject, and maturely weigh what I have advanced respecting the rights of woman and national education.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 101.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1791, French feminist [[Olympe de Gouges]] had published her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'', and the question of women's rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain.&lt;ref name=MS1112/&gt;

The ''Rights of Woman'' is an extension of Wollstonecraft's arguments in the ''Rights of Men''. In the ''Rights of Men'', as the title suggests, she is concerned with the rights of particular men (18th-century British men) while in the ''Rights of Woman'', she is concerned with the rights afforded to &quot;woman&quot;, an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter of the ''Rights of Woman'' addresses the issue of [[natural rights]] and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 105–6; Kelly, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rights of Woman'' thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by contemporary [[Political philosophy|political philosophers]] such as [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 182–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Wollstonecraft did not employ the formal argumentation or logical prose style common to 18th-century philosophical writing when composing her own works. The ''Rights of Woman'' is a long essay that introduces all of its major topics in the opening chapters and then repeatedly returns to them, each time from a different point of view. It also adopts a hybrid tone that combines rational argument with the fervent rhetoric of [[sensibility]].&lt;ref name=K110&gt;Kelly, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, ''sensibility'' was a physical phenomenon that came to be attached to a specific set of moral beliefs. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men.&lt;ref name=BB9&gt;Barker-Benfield, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the [[abolitionism|movement to abolish the slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Barker-Benfield, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; But sensibility also paralyzed those who had too much of it; as scholar G. J. Barker-Benfield explains, &quot;an innate refinement of nerves was also identifiable with greater suffering, with weakness, and a susceptibility to disorder&quot;.&lt;ref name=BB9/&gt;

By the time Wollstonecraft was writing the ''Rights of Woman'', sensibility had already been under sustained attack for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, ''Sensibility'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Sensibility, which had initially promised to draw individuals together through sympathy, was now viewed as &quot;profoundly separatist&quot;; novels, plays, and poems that employed the language of sensibility asserted individual rights, sexual freedom, and unconventional familial relationships based only upon feeling.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, ''Sensibility'', 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as [[Janet Todd]], another scholar of sensibility, argues, “to many in Britain the cult of sensibility seemed to have feminized the nation, given women undue prominence, and emasculated men.”&lt;ref&gt;Todd, ''Sensibility'', 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rational education===
One of Wollstonecraft's central arguments in the ''Rights of Woman'' is that women should be educated rationally in order to give them the opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and [[conduct book]] writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books,&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor, Jennie. &quot;[http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=216 Conduct Book].&quot; ''The Literary Encyclopedia''. Retrieved on 14 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as [[Catharine Macaulay]] and [[Hester Chapone]], maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, ''[[Thoughts on the Education of Daughters]]'' (1787), in her children's book, ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (1788), as well as in the ''Rights of Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 169ff; Kelly, 123; Taylor, 14–15; Sapiro, 27–28; 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stating in her preface that “my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if [woman] be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all&quot;, Wollstonecraft contends that society will degenerate without educated women, particularly because mothers are the primary educators of young children.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 102; Sapiro, 154–55.&lt;/ref&gt; She attributes the problem of uneducated women to men and “a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who [consider] females rather as women than human creatures&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Women are capable of rationality; it only appears that they are not, because men have refused to educate them and encouraged them to be frivolous (Wollstonecraft describes silly women as &quot;spaniels&quot; and &quot;toys&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 124–26; Taylor, 234–37; Sapiro, 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt; While stressing it is of the same kind, she entertains the notion that women might not be able to attain the same degree of knowledge that men do.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite book|author=Tong, Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|edition=3|publisher=Westview Press (Perseus Books)|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft attacks conduct book writers such as [[James Fordyce]] and [[John Gregory (moralist)|John Gregory]] as well as educational philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] who argue that a woman does not need a rational education. (Rousseau famously argues in ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men; Wollstonecraft, infuriated by this argument, attacks not only it but also Rousseau himself.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 126; Taylor, 14–15; Sapiro, 130–31.&lt;/ref&gt;) Intent on illustrating the limitations that contemporary educational theory placed upon women, Wollstonecraft writes, &quot;taught from their infancy that beauty is woman’s sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 157.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that without this damaging ideology, which encourages young women to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, they could achieve much more. Wives could be the rational &quot;companions&quot; of their husbands and even pursue careers should they so choose: &quot;women might certainly study the art of healing, and be physicians as well as nurses. And midwifery, decency seems to [[wikt:allot|allot]] to them&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. they might, also, study politics&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Business of various kinds, they might likewise pursue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 286; see also Kelly, 125–24; Taylor, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Wollstonecraft, &quot;the most perfect education&quot; is &quot;an exercise of the understanding as is best calculated to strengthen the body and form the heart. Or, in other words, to enable the individual to attach such habits of virtue as will render it independent.”&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her broad philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft lays out a specific plan for national education to counter [[Talleyrand|Talleyrand's]]. In Chapter 12, &quot;On National Education&quot;, she proposes that all children be sent to a &quot;country day school&quot; as well as given some education at home &quot;to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures&quot;. She also maintains that schooling should be [[coeducation|co-educational]], contending that men and women, whose marriages are &quot;the cement of society&quot;, should be &quot;educated after the same model&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', Chapter 12; see also, Kelly, 124–25; 133–34; Sapiro, 237ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

New York: Praeger Publishers, 1972; p. 217. {{LCCN|72|0|77546}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It is debatable to what extent the ''Rights of Woman'' is a [[feminist]] text; because the definitions of ''feminist'' vary, different scholars have come to different conclusions. Wollstonecraft herself would never have referred to her text as feminist because the words ''feminist'' and ''feminism'' were not coined until the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;''Feminist'' and ''feminism''. ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Retrieved on 17 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there was no [[feminist movement]] to speak of during Wollstonecraft's lifetime. In the introduction to her seminal work on Wollstonecraft's thought, [[Barbara Taylor]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Describing [Wollstonecraft's philosophy] as feminist is problematic, and I do it only after much consideration. The label is of course anachronistic&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Treating Wollstonecraft’s thought as an anticipation of nineteenth and twentieth-century feminist argument has meant sacrificing or distorting some of its key elements. Leading examples of this&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. have been the widespread neglect of her religious beliefs, and the misrepresentation of her as a bourgeois liberal, which together have resulted in the displacement of a religiously inspired utopian radicalism by a secular, class-partisan reformism as alien to Wollstonecraft’s political project as her dream of a divinely promised age of universal happiness is to our own. Even more important however has been the imposition on Wollstonecraft of a heroic-individualist brand of politics utterly at odds with her own ethically driven case for women’s emancipation. Wollstonecraft’s leading ambition for women was that they should attain virtue, and it was to this end that she sought their liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 12; see also, 55–57; see also Sapiro, 257–59.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the ''Rights of Woman'', Wollstonecraft does not make the claim for gender equality using the same arguments or the same language that late 19th- and 20th century feminists later would. For instance, rather than unequivocally stating that men and women are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 126, 146; Taylor, 105–106; 118–20.&lt;/ref&gt; For Wollstonecraft, men and women are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to 21st-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the 18th century. For example, it implied that both men and women—not just women—should be modest&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 102 and 252.&lt;/ref&gt; and respect the sanctity of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft's argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late 18th century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.

However, Wollstonecraft's arguments for equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 110; Sapiro, 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let it not be concluded, that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, Wollstonecraft calls on men, rather than women, to initiate the social and political changes she outlines in the ''Rights of Woman''. Because women are uneducated, they cannot alter their own situation—men must come to their aid.&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 79; Kelly, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft writes at the end of her chapter &quot;Of the Pernicious Effects Which Arise from the Unnatural Distinctions Established in Society&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I then would [[wikt:fain|fain]] convince reasonable men of the importance of some of my remarks; and prevail on them to weigh dispassionately the whole tenor of my observations.&amp;nbsp;– I appeal to their understandings; and, as a fellow-creature, claim, in the name of my sex, some interest in their hearts. I entreat them to assist to emancipate their companion, to make her a help meet for them! Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience, they would find us more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more faithful wives, more reasonable mothers&amp;nbsp;– in a word, better citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 288.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is Wollstonecraft's last novel, ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman]]'' (1798), the fictionalized sequel to the ''Rights of Woman'', that is usually considered her most radical feminist work.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Chapter 9; Sapiro, 37; 149; 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensibility===
One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing criticisms in the ''Rights of Woman'' is against false and excessive [[sensibility]], particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are &quot;blown about by every momentary gust of feeling&quot;; because these women are &quot;the prey of their senses&quot;, they cannot think rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 177.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, not only do they do harm to themselves but they also do harm to all of civilization: these are not women who can refine civilization – these are women who will destroy it. But reason and feeling are not independent for Wollstonecraft; rather, she believes that they should inform each other. For Wollstonecraft, as for the important 18th-century philosopher [[David Hume]], the passions underpin all reason.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a theme that she would return to throughout her career, but particularly in her novels ''[[Mary: A Fiction]]'' (1788) and ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman]]''.

As part of her argument that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that they should not be constrained by or made slaves to their bodies or their sexual feelings.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 259–60; Taylor, 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular argument has led many modern feminists to suggest that Wollstonecraft intentionally avoids granting women any sexual desire. Cora Kaplan argues that the &quot;negative and prescriptive assault on female sexuality&quot; is a &quot;''[[leitmotif]]''&quot; of the ''Rights of Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, “Wild Nights&quot;, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wollstonecraft advises her readers to &quot;calmly let passion subside into friendship&quot; in the ideal companionate marriage (that is, in the ideal of a love-based marriage that was developing at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 249.&lt;/ref&gt; It would be better, she writes, when “two virtuous young people marry . . . if some circumstances checked their passion”.&lt;ref name=W192&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wollstonecraft, “love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom&quot;.&lt;ref name=W192/&gt; As Mary Poovey explains, “Wollstonecraft betrays her fear that female desire might in fact court man’s lascivious and degrading attentions, that the subordinate position women have been given might even be deserved. Until women can transcend their fleshly desires and fleshly forms, they will be hostage to the body.”&lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; If women are not interested in sexuality, they cannot be dominated by men. Wollstonecraft worries that women are consumed with &quot;romantic wavering&quot;, that is, they are interested only in satisfying their lusts.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ''Rights of Woman'' eliminates sexuality from a woman's life, Kaplan contends, it  “expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual&quot; while at the same time &quot;exaggerat[ing] the importance of the sensual in the everyday life of women&quot;. Wollstonecraft was so determined to wipe sexuality from her picture of the ideal woman that she ended up foregrounding it by insisting upon its absence.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, &quot;Wild Nights&quot;, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; But as Kaplan and others have remarked, Wollstonecraft may have been forced to make this sacrifice: &quot;it is important to remember that the notion of woman as politically enabled and independent [was] fatally linked [during the eighteenth century] to the unrestrained and vicious exercise of her sexuality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, &quot;Wild Nights&quot;, 33; see also Taylor, 118–19; Taylor, 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republicanism===
[[Image:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Men with guns being led by a half-naked woman who is holding the French flag. She and they are walking over dead bodies. The painting is structured like a triangle, with the woman at the apex. The dead are lying at the base of the triangle.|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1833)]]
[[Claudia L. Johnson (scholar)|Claudia Johnson]], a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, has called the ''Rights of Woman'' &quot;a republican manifesto&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson contends that Wollstonecraft is hearkening back to the [[Commonwealth men|Commonwealth]] tradition of the 17th century and attempting to reestablish a [[republicanism|republican]] ethos. In Wollstonecraft's version, there would be strong, but separate, masculine and feminine roles for citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 29; see also Taylor, 211–22; Sapiro, 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Johnson, Wollstonecraft &quot;denounces the collapse of proper sexual distinction as the leading feature of her age, and as the grievous consequence of sentimentality itself. The problem undermining society in her view is feminized men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; If men feel free to adopt both the masculine position and the sentimental feminine position, she argues, women have no position open to them in society.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson therefore sees Wollstonecraft as a critic, in both the ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men|Rights of Men]]'' and the ''Rights of Woman'', of the &quot;masculinization of sensitivity&quot; in such works as [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Rights of Woman'' Wollstonecraft adheres to a version of republicanism that includes a belief in the eventual overthrow of all titles, including the monarchy. She also briefly suggests that all men and women should be represented in government. But the bulk of her “political criticism,” as Chris Jones, a Wollstonecraft scholar, explains, “is couched predominantly in terms of morality&quot;.&lt;ref name=J43&gt;Jones, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Her definition of virtue focuses on the individual’s happiness rather than, for example, the good of the entire society.&lt;ref name=J43/&gt; This is reflected in her explanation of [[natural rights]]. Because rights ultimately proceed from God, Wollstonecraft maintains that there are duties, tied to those rights, incumbent upon each and every person. For Wollstonecraft, the individual is taught republicanism and benevolence within the family; domestic relations and familial ties are crucial to her understanding of social cohesion and patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 46; Taylor, 211–22; ''Vindications'', 101–102, for example.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class===
In many ways the ''Rights of Woman'' is inflected by a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] view of the world, as is its direct predecessor the ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men|Rights of Men]]''. Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle class, which she calls the &quot;most natural state&quot;. She also frequently praises modesty and industry, virtues which, at the time, were associated with the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 128ff; Taylor, 167–68; Sapiro, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; From her position as a middle-class writer arguing for a middle-class ethos, Wollstonecraft also attacks the wealthy, criticizing them using the same arguments she employs against women. She points out the &quot;false-refinement, immorality, and vanity&quot; of the rich, calling them &quot;weak, artificial beings, raised above the common wants and affections of their race, in a premature unnatural manner [who] undermine the very foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the whole mass of society&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 111; see also Taylor, 159–61; Sapiro, 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Wollstonecraft's criticisms of the wealthy do not necessarily reflect a concomitant sympathy for the poor. For her, the poor are fortunate because they will never be trapped by the snares of wealth: “Happy is it when people have the cares of life to struggle with; for these struggles prevent their becoming a prey to enervating vices, merely from idleness!”&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, she contends that charity has only negative consequences because, as Jones puts it, she “sees it as sustaining an unequal society while giving the appearance of virtue to the rich&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 45; see also Taylor, 218–19; Sapiro, 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her national plan for education, she retains class distinctions (with an exception for the intelligent), suggesting that: &quot;After the age of nine, girls and boys, intended for domestic employments, or mechanical trades, ought to be removed to other schools, and receive instruction, in some measure appropriated to the destination of each individual . . . The young people of superior abilities, or fortune, might now be taught, in another school, the dead and living languages, the elements of science, and continue the study of history and politics, on a more extensive scale, which would not exclude polite literature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 311; Kelly, 132–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric and style==
[[Image:EmileTitle.jpeg|right|thumb|alt=Page reads &quot;Émile, ou de L'Education. Par J. J. Rousseau, Citoyen de Genève....Tome Premier. A La Haye, Chez jean Neaulme, Libraire. M.DCC.LXII....&quot;|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau's]] ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762)]]
In attempting to navigate the cultural expectations of female writers and the generic conventions of political and philosophical discourse, Wollstonecraft, as she does throughout her ''[[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]]'', constructs a unique blend of masculine and feminine styles in the ''Rights of Woman''.&lt;ref name=K109&gt;Kelly, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; She utilizes the language of philosophy, referring to her work as a &quot;treatise&quot; with &quot;arguments&quot; and &quot;principles&quot;.&lt;ref name=K109/&gt; However, Wollstonecraft also uses a personal tone, employing &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot;, dashes and exclamation marks, and autobiographical references to create a distinctly feminine voice in the text.&lt;ref name=K110/&gt; The ''Rights of Woman'' further hybridizes its genre by weaving together elements of the conduct book, the short essay, and the novel, genres often associated with women, while at the same time claiming that these genres could be used to discuss philosophical topics such as rights.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 113–14; Taylor, 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Wollstonecraft argues against excessive [[sensibility]], the rhetoric of the ''Rights of Woman'' is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader. Many of the most emotional comments in the book are directed at [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]. For example, after excerpting a long passage from ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762), Wollstonecraft pithily states, &quot;I shall make no other comments on this ingenious passage, than just to observe, that it is the philosophy of lasciviousness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 162.&lt;/ref&gt; A mere page later, after indicting Rousseau's plan for female education, she writes &quot;I must relieve myself by drawing another picture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 163.&lt;/ref&gt; These terse exclamations are meant to draw the reader to her side of the argument (it is assumed that the reader will agree with them). While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas will reach the broadest possible audience,&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 111–12.&lt;/ref&gt; she actually combines the plain, rational language of the political treatise with the poetic, passionate language of sensibility in order to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 109ff; Sapiro, 207–208.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft defends her positions not only with reasoned argument but also with ardent rhetoric.

In her efforts to vividly describe the condition of women within society, Wollstonecraft employs several different analogies.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 118ff; Sapiro, 222.&lt;/ref&gt; She often compares women to slaves, arguing that their ignorance and powerlessness places them in that position. But at the same time, she also compares them to &quot;capricious tyrants&quot; who use cunning and deceit to manipulate the men around them. At one point, she reasons that a woman can become either a slave or tyrant, which she describes as two sides of the same coin.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 158; Sapiro, 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft also compares women to soldiers; like military men, they are valued only for their appearance. And like the rich, women's &quot;softness&quot; has &quot;debased mankind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 165; Taylor, 159–61; Sapiro, 124–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revision==
Wollstonecraft was forced to write the ''Rights of Woman'' hurriedly in order to respond to [[Talleyrand]] and ongoing events. Upon completing the work, she wrote to her friend [[William Roscoe]]: &quot;I am dissatisfied with myself for not having done justice to the subject.&amp;nbsp;– Do not suspect me of false modesty&amp;nbsp;– I mean to say that had I allowed myself more time I could have written a better book, in every sense of the word&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, Mary. ''The Collected Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft''. Ed. Janet Todd. New York: Penguin Books (2003), 193–94.&lt;/ref&gt; When Wollstonecraft revised the ''Rights of Woman'' for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald and Scherf, &quot;Introduction&quot;, 23 and Mellor, 141–42.&lt;/ref&gt; She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 141–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wollstonecraft never wrote the second part to the ''Rights of Woman,'' although [[William Godwin]] published her &quot;Hints&quot;, which were &quot;chiefly designed to have been incorporated in the second part of the ''Vindication of the Rights of Woman''&quot;, in the posthumous collection of her works.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald and Scherf, Appendix C.&lt;/ref&gt; However, she did begin writing the novel ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman]]'', which most scholars consider a fictionalized sequel to the ''Rights of Woman''. It was unfinished at her death and also included in the ''Posthumous Works'' published by Godwin.&lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[Image:Marywollstonecraft.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Left-looking half-length portrait of a slightly pregnant woman in a white dress|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] by [[John Opie]] (c. 1797)]]
When it was first published in 1792, the ''Rights of Woman'' was reviewed favourably by the ''[[Analytical Review]]'', the ''General Magazine'', the ''Literary Magazine'', ''New York Magazine'', and the ''Monthly Review'', although the assumption persists even today that ''Rights of Woman'' received hostile reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Janes, 293; Sapiro, 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; It was almost immediately released in a second edition in 1792, several American editions appeared, and it was translated into French. Taylor writes that &quot;it was an immediate success&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 25; see also, Janes, 293–302; Wardle, 157–58; Kelly, 135–36; Sapiro 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, other writers such as [[Mary Hays]] and [[Mary Robinson (poet)|Mary Robinson]] specifically alluded to Wollstonecraft's text in their own works. Hays cited the ''Rights of Woman'' in her novel ''[[Memoirs of Emma Courtney]]'' (1796) and modelled her female characters after Wollstonecraft's ideal woman.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 143–44 and 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Although female conservatives such as [[Hannah More]] excoriated Wollstonecraft personally, they actually shared many of the same values. As the scholar Anne Mellor has shown, both More and Wollstonecraft wanted a society founded on “Christian virtues of rational benevolence, honesty, personal virtue, the fulfillment of social duty, thrift, sobriety, and hard work&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1790s, many writers within British society were engaged in an intense debate regarding the position of women in society. For example, the respected poet and essayist [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]] and Wollstonecraft sparred back and forth; Barbauld published several poems responding to Wollstonecraft’s work and Wollstonecraft commented on them in footnotes to the ''Rights of Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The work also provoked outright hostility. The [[bluestocking]] [[Elizabeth Carter]] was unimpressed with the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon, 154&quot;&gt;Gordon, 154&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]], the [[Neoplatonist]] translator who had been a landlord to the Wollstonecraft family in the late 1770s, swiftly wrote a satire called ''A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes'': if women have rights, why not [[animal rights|animals too]]?&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon, 154&quot;/&gt; 

After Wollstonecraft died in 1797, her husband [[William Godwin]] published his ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1798). He revealed much about her private life that had previously not been known to the public: her illegitimate child, her love affairs, and her attempts at suicide. While Godwin believed he was portraying his wife with love, sincerity, and compassion, contemporary readers were shocked by Wollstonecraft's unorthodox lifestyle and she became a reviled figure. [[Richard Polwhele]] targeted her in particular in his anonymous long poem ''[[The Unsex'd Females]]'' (1798), a defensive reaction to women's literary self-assertion: Hannah More is Christ to Wollstonecraft's Satan. His poem was &quot;well known&quot; among the responses ''A Vindication''.&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Craciun, ''Mary Wollstonecraft's a'' Vindication of the Rights of Woman'': A Sourcebook'' (Routledge, 2002, 2).&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer comments this &quot;ingenious poem&quot; with its &quot;playful sallies of sarcastic wit&quot; against &quot;our modern ladies,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Griffiths, ''The Monthly Review'' 30 (1799): 103.&lt;/ref&gt; though others found it &quot;a tedious, lifeless piece of writing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=PolUnse.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=front Introduction], ''The Unsex'd Females'', Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical responses largely fell along clear-cut political lines.

Wollstonecraft’s ideas became associated with her life story and women writers felt that it was dangerous to mention her in their texts. Hays, who had previously been a close friend&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Robins Pennell|Pennell, Elizabeth Robins]] p351, ''Life of Mary Wollstonecraft''. (Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1884).&lt;/ref&gt; and an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her ''Rights of Woman'', for example, did not include her in the collection of ''Illustrious and Celebrated Women'' she published in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 145; Taylor, 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maria Edgeworth]] specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in her novel ''[[Belinda (Edgeworth novel)|Belinda]]'' (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist in the character of Harriet Freke.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 155; Taylor, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; But, like [[Jane Austen]], she does not reject Wollstonecraft’s ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial to the development of the nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative views towards Wollstonecraft persisted for over a century. The ''Rights of Woman'' was not reprinted until the middle of the 19th century and it still retained an aura of ill-repute. [[George Eliot]] wrote &quot;there is in some quarters a vague prejudice against the ''Rights of Woman'' as in some way or other a reprehensible book, but readers who go to it with this impression will be surprised to find it eminently serious, severely moral, and withal rather heavy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sapiro, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[suffragist]] (i.e. moderate reformer, as opposed to [[suffragette]]) [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett]] wrote the introduction to the centenary edition of the ''Rights of Woman'', cleansing the memory of Wollstonecraft and claiming her as the foremother of the struggle for the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 521&lt;/ref&gt;  While the ''Rights of Woman'' may have paved the way for feminist arguments, 20th century feminists have tended to use Wollstonecraft's life story, rather than her texts, for inspiration;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan,&quot;Mary Wollstonecraft’s reception and legacies&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; her unorthodox lifestyle convinced them to try new &quot;experiments in living&quot;, as [[Virginia Woolf]] termed it in her famous essay on Wollstonecraft.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Virginia. &quot;[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91c2/chapter13.html The Four Figures]&quot;. Retrieved on 17 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is some evidence that the ''Rights of Woman'' may be influencing current feminists. [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], a feminist who is critical of [[Women and Islam|Islam's dictates regarding women]], cites the ''Rights of Woman'' in her autobiography ''[[Infidel (book)|Infidel]]'', writing that she was &quot;inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ayaan Hirsi Ali|Hirsi Ali, Ayaan]]. ''Infidel''. New York: Free Press (2007), 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Afghan Hound''' is one of the oldest [[sighthound]] [[dog breed]]s. Distinguished by its thick, fine, silky coat and its tail with a ring curl at the end, the breed acquired its unique features in the cold mountains of [[Afghanistan]], where it was originally used to hunt [[hare]]s and [[gazelle]]s by [[coursing]] them. Its local name is '''Sag-e Tāzī''' ({{lang-fa|سگ تازی}}) or '''Tāžī Spai''' ({{lang-ps|تاژي سپی}}). Other alternate names for this breed are ''[[Koochee dog|Kuchi Hound]]'', ''Tāzī'', ''Balkh Hound'', ''Baluchi Hound'', ''Barutzy Hound'', ''Shalgar Hound'', ''Kabul Hound'', ''Galanday Hound'', or sometimes incorrectly ''African Hound''.

==Description==
===Appearance===
[[Image:Afghan-Hound.jpg|thumb|left|This Afghan hound is black and [[brindle]]; however, the photo shows it with a reddish tinge to the coat, which can occur in a black-coated dog.]]
The Afghan Hound is tall, standing in height 24-29&amp;nbsp;inches and weighing 45-60 pounds. The coat may be any colour, but white markings, particularly on the head, are discouraged; many individuals have a [[melanistic mask|black facial mask]]. Some specimens have facial hair that looks like a [[Fu Manchu moustache]] that are called &quot;mandarins.&quot; Some Afghan Hounds are almost white, but particolour hounds (white with islands of red or black) are not acceptable and may indicate impure breeding. The long, fine-textured coat requires considerable care and grooming. The long topknot and the shorter-haired saddle on the back in the miniature dog are distinctive features of the Afghan Hound coat. The high hipbones and unique small ring on the end of the tail are also characteristics of the breed.

The temperament of the typical Afghan Hound can be aloof and dignified, but happy and clownish when playing. This breed, as is the case with many sighthounds, has a high prey drive and may not get along with small animals. The Afghan Hounds' reasoning skills have made it a successful competitor in dog agility trials as well as an intuitive therapy dog and companion.  Genomic studies have pointed to the Afghan Hound as one of the oldest of dog breeds.&lt;ref&gt;P. Savolainen et al. Science 298, 1610 Nov 22, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The breed has a reputation among some dog trainers of having a relatively slow &quot;obedience intelligence&quot; as defined by author [[Stanley Coren]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Intelligence of Dogs (book)]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although seldom used today for hunting in [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]] where they are popular, Afghan hounds are frequent participants in [[lure coursing]] events and are also popular in the [[List of dog sports|sport]] of [[conformation show]]ing.

==Health==
===Mortality===
Afghan Hounds in UK surveys had a median lifespan of about 12 years and 18 years if the dog is taken care of,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassidy Data&quot;&gt;http://users.pullman.com/lostriver/breeddata.htm Dog Longevity Web Site, Breed Data page. Compiled by K. M. Cassidy. Retrieved July 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which is similar to other breeds of their size.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassidy Weight&quot;&gt;http://users.pullman.com/lostriver/weight_and_lifespan.htm Dog Longevity Web Site, Weight and Longevity page. Compiled by K. M. Cassidy. Retrieved July 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (31%), old age (20%), cardiac (10.5%), and urologic (5%).&lt;ref name=&quot;KC Survey&quot;&gt;http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/570 Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee. 2004. Purebred Dog Health Survey. Retrieved July 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morbidity and health concerns===
Major health issues are [[allergy|allergies]], and [[cancer]]. Sensitivity to [[anesthesia]] is an issue the Afghan hound shares with the rest of the [[sighthound]] group, as sighthounds have relatively low levels of body fat. Afghan hounds are also among the dog breeds most likely to develop [[chylothorax]], a rare condition which causes the thoracic ducts to leak, allowing large quantities of [[Chyle|chyle fluid]] to enter the dog's chest cavity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akcchf.org/pdfs/whitepapers/HoundGroup07.pdf]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition commonly results in a lung torsion (in which the dog's lung twists within the chest cavity, requiring emergency surgery), due to the breed's typically deep, &quot;barrel&quot;-shaped chest. If not corrected through surgery, chylothorax can ultimately cause fibrosing pleuritis, or a hardening of the organs, due to scar tissue forming around the organs to protect them from the chyle fluid. Chylothorax is not necessarily, but often, fatal.

==History==
[[Sighthound]]s are among the oldest recognisable [[Dog type|types]] of dogs, and genetic testing has placed the Afghan Hound breed among those with the least genetic divergence from the wolf on some markers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2007/5/genetics-and-the-shape-of-dogs

}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is taken to mean that such dogs are descended from the oldest [[dog type]]s, not that the breeds tested had in antiquity their exact modern form. Today's modern purebred breed of Afghan Hound descends from dogs brought in the 1920s to Great Britain, and are a blending of types and varieties of long haired sighthounds from across Afghanistan and the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghan-network.net/Culture/afghan-hound.html |title=Afghan Hound: A History |publisher=Afghan Network |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some had been kept as hunting dogs, others as guardians.&lt;ref&gt;Afghan Hounds, by Beverly Pisano pg. 12

ISBN 978-0-87666-682-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Although demonstrably ancient, verifiable written or visual records that tie today's Afghan Hound breed to specific Afghan owners or places is absent, even though there is much speculation about possible connections with the ancient world among [[Animal fancy|fanciers]] and in non-scientific breed books and breed websites. Connections with other types and breeds from the same area may provide clues to the history. A name for a desert coursing Afghan hound, [[Tazi]] (sag-e-tazi), suggests a shared ancestry with the very similar Tasy breed from the [[Caspian Sea]] area of [[Russia]] and [[Turkmenistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebreedsofdogs.com/EAST_RUSSIAN_COURSING_HOUNDS.htm |title=East Russian Coursing Hounds |work=Dog Breeds: List of Breeds of Dogs |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Other types or breeds of similar appearance are the Taigan from the mountainous [[Tian Shan]] region on the Chinese border of Afghanistan, and the [[Barakzay]], or [[Kurram Valley]] Hound, from [[India]]/[[Pakistan]]. There are at least 13 types known in Afghanistan,&lt;ref name=&quot;historie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nika-afghani.unas.cz/historie.htm |title=Historie afgánského chrta |language=Czech |trans_title=History of the Afghan Hound |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some are being developed (through breeding and recordkeeping) into modern purebred breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/~w-40770/star/rare/rare2.html |title=List of Rare Sighthounds |date=May 18, 2000 |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the lives of the peoples with whom these dogs developed change in the modern world, often these [[landrace]] types of dogs lose their use and disappear; there may have been many more types of longhaired sighthound in the past.

Once out of Persia, India and Afghanistan, the history of the Afghan Hound breed becomes an important part of the history of the very earliest dog shows and [[The Kennel Club]] (UK). Various sighthounds were brought to England in the 1800s by army officers returning from India (which at the time included Pakistan), Afghanistan, and [[Persia]], and were exhibited at dog shows, which were then just becoming popular, under various names, such as Barukzy hounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;historie&quot; /&gt; They were also called &quot;Persian Greyhounds&quot; by the English, in reference to their own indigenous sighthound.

One dog in particular, ''Zardin'', was brought in 1907 from India by Captain Bariff&lt;http://www.afghanhoundtimes.com/zardinb.htm&gt;, and became the early ideal of [[breed type]] for what was still called the Persian Greyhound. Zardin was the basis of the writing of the first breed standard in 1912, but breeding of the dogs was stopped by World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;historie&quot; /&gt;

Out of the longhaired sighthound types known in Afghanistan, two main strains make up the modern Afghan Hound breed. The first were a group of hounds brought to [[Scotland]] from [[Balochistan (Afghanistan)|Baluchistan]] by Major and Mrs. G. Bell-Murray and Miss Jean C. Manson in 1920, and are called the ''Bell-Murray strain''. These dogs were of the lowland or steppe type, also called kalagh, and are less heavily coated. The second strain was a group of dogs from a kennel in [[Kabul]] owned by Mrs. Mary Amps, which she shipped to England in 1925. She and her husband came to Kabul after the Afghan war in 1919, and the foundation sire of her kennel (named Ghazni) in Kabul was a dog that closely resembled Zardin. Her ''Ghazni strain'' were the more heavily coated mountain type.  Most of the Afghans in the United States were developed from the Ghazni strain from England. The first Afghans in Australia were imported from the United States in 1934, also of the Ghazni strain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aniwa.com/en/chien/document/en/chien/magazine/discover/dog-breeds/afghan-hound--from-the-streets-of-kabul-to-the-main-rings-of-the-world/index.htm Chien Magazine Afghan Hound history]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The French breed club was formed in 1939 (FALAPA). The mountain and steppe strains became mixed into the modern Afghan Hound breed, and a new standard was written in 1948, which is still used today.

The spectacular beauty of Afghan Hound dogs caused them to become highly desirable showdogs and pets, and they are recognised by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. One of the Amps Ghazni, ''Sirdar'', won BIS at [[Crufts]] in 1928 and 1930. An Afghan hound was featured on the cover of [[Life Magazine]], November 26, 1945. &quot;Afghan Hounds were the most popular in Australia in the 1970s…and won most of the major shows&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aniwa.com/en/chien/document/en/general/magazine/discover/dog-breeds/a-bunch-of-internationally-famous-breeders/index.htm]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Afghan Hound won BIS (Best in Show) at the 1996 [[World Dog Show]] in Budapest. Afghan hounds were BIS at the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] in 1957 and again in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/history/biswinners.html |title=Best In Show Winners |publisher=The Westminster Kennel Club |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That win also marked the most recent win at Westminster for an breeder-owner-handler, Chris Terrell.

The Afghan Hound breed is no longer used for hunting, although it can be seen in the sport of [[lure coursing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peds.co.uk/afghan/coursing.htm Afghan Hound Lure Coursing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Because of its distinctive appearance, the Afghan hound has been represented in animated feature films, including Universal Pictures' [[Balto]] (Sylvie), Disney's [[Lady and the Tramp II]] (Ruby), an Afghan hound also appeared on 101 Dalmatians and the television series [[What-a-Mess]] (Prince Amir of Kinjan and, as Rita in the 1988 [[Disney]] animated film [[Oliver &amp; Company]]. Afghan hounds have also been featured in television advertisements and in fashion magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afghanhoundactors.com/about.html |title=Afghan Hound Actors for Film, Television, Print and Stage |publisher=Afghan Hound Actors |year=2008 |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Afghan hound is represented in books as well, including being featured in a series of mystery novels by Nina Wright (Abra), and a talking Afghan Hound in [[David Rothman]]'s The [[Solomon Scandals]] (2008, Twilight Times Books). In the novel ''[[Between the Acts]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]] uses an Afghan hound (named Sohrab) to represent aspects of one of the book's human characters.&lt;ref&gt;The Philosophy of Virginia Woolf: A Philosophical Reading of the Mature Novels

On August 3, 2005, Korean scientist [[Hwang Woo-Suk]] announced that his team of researchers had become the first team to successfully [[cloning|clone]] a dog, an Afghan Hound named [[Snuppy]]. In 2006 Hwang Woo-Suk was dismissed from his university position for fabricating data in his research. Snuppy, nonetheless, was a genuine clone, and thus the first cloned dog in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4784301 |title=Meet Snuppy, the World's First Cloned Dog |last=Palca |first=Joe |publisher=NPR |date=August 3, 2005 |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the BBC Three Sitcom ''[[Mongrels (TV series)|Mongrels]]'' the character of Destiny is an Afghan Hound.

In the 2010 comedy [[Marmaduke (film)|Marmaduke]] two Afghan hounds appear in the dog park and are shown to resemble high school girls watching the more athletic dogs as if they were &quot;jocks&quot; and are also shown to be &quot;air heads&quot;.

[[Frank Muir]] wrote a series of children's books about an Afghan puppy called &quot;What-a-mess&quot;.

The '''Azawakh''' is a [[sighthound]] [[dog breed]] from [[Africa]]. 

== Description ==
=== Appearance ===
Morphology is very similar to that of the Middle Eastern and North African sight hounds, all swift, high-bred coursing hounds, although there are several obvious differences. For example, a short, flat back combined with long legs place the hips higher than the withers. The Azawakh is almond eyed and thin. It moves with a distinctly feline gait and can be found in a variety of colors as well as varying degrees of refinement, though format is basically constant. 

The standards call for a hound from {{convert|33|to|55|lb|kg|abbr=off}}; its height is {{convert|24|to|29|in|cm|abbr=off}}. The coat is very short and almost absent on the belly. Its bone structure shows clearly through the skin and musculature. Its muscles are &quot;dry&quot;, meaning that they lie quite flat, unlike the [[Greyhound]] and [[Whippet]]. In this respect it is similar in type to the [[Saluki]]. 

In [[Africa]], Azawakh are found in a variety of colors such as red, blue fawn (that is, with a lilac cast), grizzle, and, rarely, blue and black. The Azawakh in its native land also comes with various white markings including Irish marked (white collar) and particolour (mostly white).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tombouktous-azawakhs.de/epa.html Tombouktous-azawakhs.de] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this wide color variation in the native population, the American standard used by the [[American Kennel Club|AKC]] and [[United Kennel Club|UKC]] allows any color combination found in Africa. In the United States, the FCI standard is modified to have no color restrictions at a minimum and there is a strong sentiment that the FCI standard should be heavily edited or replaced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theazawakhclub.com/the-standard-of-the-azawakh/a-new-standard/ © 2009 The Azawakh Club of America, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Colors permitted by the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale|FCI]] breed standard are clear sand to dark fawn/brown, red and [[brindle]] (with or without a [[melanistic mask|dark mask]]), with white bib, tail tip, and white on all feet (which can be tips of toes to high stockings). Currently, white stockings that go above the elbow joint are considered disqualifying features in France, as is a white collar or half collar (Irish marked).  

The Azawakh’s light, supple, lissome gait is a notable breed characteristic, as is an upright [[double suspension gallop]].

=== Health ===
Azawakhs are an incredibly sound coursing hound. Serious coursing injuries are rare. The dogs heal very quickly from injury.

Azawakh have no known incidence of hip dysplasia. There is a small occurrence of adult-onset idiopathic [[epilepsy]] in the breed. [[Wobbler disease]] or cervical vertebral instability does rarely occur. Some breeders believe this is largely a developmental problem where puppies grow too quickly due to a high-protein western diet.

Like the Basenji and Tibetan Mastiff, the Azawakh bitch often has a single annual estrus. Unassisted birth of healthy puppies is the norm. Litter sizes are usually from 4 to 6 puppies but litters as small as 1 and as large as 8 occur.

Azawakh need a fairly high level of exercise and should have regular runs off lead in large enclosed areas to run off steam. The dogs are very social and emotional. They need a master that provides firm but fair leadership. Azawakh thrive on companionship of other Azawakh.

=== Temperament ===
[[File:Azawakh 12 big.jpg|thumb|right|Azawakh in motion]]
Unlike other sighthounds, the primary function of the Azawakh in its native land is that of protector. It develops an intense bond with his owner, yet can perform independently from its master. With those they accept, Azawakh are gentle and extremely affectionate. With strangers many are reserved and prefer not to be touched, but are not inherently aggressive. Although raised to protect livestock, they do not have innate aggression toward canine nor human unless they are threatened. 

Azawakh have high energy and tremendous endurance. They are excellent training companions for runners and are nearly impervious to heat. They will happily run in weather over 100 degrees Fahrenheit that would kill a [[Greyhound]]. They often dig holes in the garden.

Many Azawakh dislike rain and cold weather.

Azawakh are pack oriented and form complex social hierarchies. They have tremendous memories and are able to recognize each other after long periods of separation. They can often be found sleeping on top of each other for warmth and companionship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tombouktous-azawakhs.de/ece.html Tombouktous-azawakhs.de] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin ===
Recent genetic, blood protein and archaeological studies as well as direct observation in the field offer a glimpse into the origin of the contemporary Azawakh breed. He comes out of the population of [[pariah dogs]] of sub-Saharan Africa&amp;mdash;also called ''bush dogs'' or ''basenji''--and is also closely related to the [[Sloughi]] of the [[Maghreb]]. Despite morphological similarities, mitochondrial DNA evidence shows that he is only very distantly related to other sight hounds. Azawakh have a rare [[glucose isomerase]] allele (GPI&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;) that occurs only in [[foxes]], [[jackals]], [[Italian wolves]], Sloughi dogs and a handful of other quite unrelated rare dogs found mostly in Japan. The presence of the GPI&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; suggests an ancient differentiation of the Azawakh from other dog populations near the base of the dog family tree divergence from wolves or perhaps a uniquely African cross-breeding with local African canids such as jackals. [[Petroglyph]] rock art dating from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago during the [[Green Sahara]] (also known as the Holocene and Neolithic Subpluvial) shows cursorial dogs in conjunction with hunters. Archaeologists have found dog bones buried in Holocene settlements in the Sahara. At the close of the Holocene Wet Phase in the 4th millennium BCE, the Sahara returned to desert and created a formidable physical barrier to travel. Together, this evidence suggests that the Azawakh population has a unique genetic heritage that has been largely isolated from other dog populations for millennia.

In the [[common era]] the Sahel dogs are almost totally isolated from northern dogs by the Sahara, but the ties to the pariah dogs to the south are extremely close. Azawakh are virtually indistinguishable from the Sahel pariah dog population from which they are drawn. In addition to a basic physical structure, the Azawakh share a number of unique traits with the pariah dogs:

* intense suspicion of the unknown
* strong guarding instinct
* pack hunting behavior
* complex social hierarchies
* unique vocalizations
* extra pre-molar teeth
* strong instinct to dig dens

Throughout the Sahel, very elegant puppies can be found among rustic siblings. The Sahel nomads do not have the same breed concepts as in the West and, unlike the [[Bedouin]] of the North, do not recognize a strict separation of ''al hor'' (noble) from ''kelb'' (mongrel) dogs. The nomads act as an extra level of selection on top of the intense natural selection pressure of the Sahel environment. The approach to selection is diametrically opposed to Western breeding. Instead of selecting which dogs to breed upon maturity, they decide which puppies should live. This approach has the advantage of maintaining a large reservoir of genetic variability and resilience.

The peoples of the Sahel control dam lines and cull puppies heavily at birth according to locally held aesthetic criteria that we do not fully understand. In the Sahel, color is not a selection criterion. The alpha male dog from the local population is usually the sire. Unless it is a wet year, only one puppy from a litter might be selected to live. Females are usually culled unless the family projects a need for more dogs in the future.

=== History ===
[[Image:Azawakh 52 jd.jpg|thumb|right|Azawakh among the [[Taureg people|Tuareg]]]]
Bred by the [[Taureg people|Tuareg]], [[Fula people|Fula]] and various other nomads of the [[Sahara]] and sub-Saharan Sahel in the countries of [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Burkina Faso]], and southern [[Algeria]], the breed is used there as a [[guard dog]] and to hunt [[gazelle]] and [[hare]] at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. The austerity of the [[Sahel]] environment has ensured that only the most fit dogs survive and has accentuated the breed's ruggedness and independence. Unlike some other sighthounds, the Azawakh is more of a pack hunter and they bump down the quarry with hindquarters when it has been tired out. In role of a guard dog, if an Azawakh senses danger it will bark to alert the other members of the pack, and they will gather together as a pack under the lead of the alpha dog, then chase off or attack the predator. The [[Sloughi]], by comparison, is more of an independent lone hunter and has a high hunting instinct.

They are relatively uncommon in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] but there is a growing band of devotees. Azawakhs have a range of temperaments from lap dog to quite fierce. Lifelong socialization and firm but gentle handling are critical. Well socialised and trained, they can be good with other dogs, cats, children, and strangers. Azawakh may be registered with the FCI in the USA via the Federación Canófila de Puerto Rico (FCPR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcpr2000.org/index-en.html Federación Canófila de Puerto Rico] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; European FCI clubs and the AKC recognize the FCPR as an acceptable registry. The [[American Kennel Club|AKC]] currently recognizes Azawakh as a [[Foundation Stock Service Program|Foundation Stock Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Smart|first=Sylvia|title=Dog Breeders Professional Secrets: Ethical Breeding Practices|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=io270OahEdMC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;ots=rvvNm3Jw7M&amp;dq=%22foundation%20stock%20service%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q=%22foundation%20stock%20service%22&amp;f=false|year=2008|publisher=Dogwise Publishing|isbn=192924259X, 9781929242597|page=44|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; breed and they are eligible to participate in AKC-sanctioned Companion &amp; Performance events. The breed will enter the AKC Miscellaneous Class on June 30, 2011. The American Azawakh Association (AAA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://azawakhs.org American Azawakh Association] &lt;/ref&gt; is the AKC Parent Club for the Azawakh. Azawakh may be registered with the [[United Kennel Club|UKC]] and [[American Rare Breed Association|ARBA]]. The breed is not yet registered by [[Canadian Kennel Club|CKC]]. Azawakh are eligible for [[American Sighthound Field Association|ASFA]] and [[American Kennel Club|AKC]] lure coursing and [[NOFCA]] open field coursing events.

'''Acrylic paint''' is fast drying [[paint]] containing pigment suspension in [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] polymer [[emulsion]]. Acrylic paints can be diluted with water, but become water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted (with water) or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a [[watercolor painting|watercolor]] or an [[oil painting]], or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media.

== History ==
{{Ref improve section|date=February 2011}}
Dr. Otto Rohm invented acrylic resin, which quickly transformed into acrylic paint. Acrylics were first made commercially available in the 1950s. These were [[mineral spirits|mineral spirit]]-based paints called [[Magna paint|Magna]]&lt;ref&gt;Terry Fenton [http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials online essay] about [[Kenneth Noland]], and acrylic paint, accessed April 30th, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; offered by Bocour Artist Colors. Water-based acrylic paints were subsequently sold as &quot;latex&quot; house paints, although acrylic dispersion uses no [[latex]] derived from a [[Para rubber tree|rubber tree]]. Interior &quot;latex&quot; house paints tend to be a combination of [[Binder (material)|binder]] (sometimes acrylic, [[vinyl]], [[Polyvinyl acetate|pva]], and others), [[filler (materials)|filler]], [[pigment]], and [[water]]. Exterior &quot;latex&quot; house paints may also be a &quot;co-polymer&quot; blend, but the very best exterior water-based paints are 100% acrylic.&lt;ref&gt;Acrylic Paint [http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Acrylic%20Paint?cx=partner-pub-0939450753529744%3Av0qd01-tdlq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Acrylic%20Paint&amp;sa=Search#856] Definition, accessed December 07, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the water-based acrylic binders were introduced as house paints, artists and companies alike began to explore the potential of the new binders. Water-soluble artists' acrylic paints became commercially available in the 1950s, offered by [[Liquitex]], with high-viscosity paints similar to those made today becoming available in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Liquitex Acrylic Art Materials [http://www.liquitex.com/aboutliquitex/history.cfm] History Timeline of Liquitex, accessed December 06, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Techniques ===

{{Main|Acrylic painting techniques }}

Acrylic artist paints may be thinned with water and used as [[wash (painting)|washes]] in the manner of watercolor paints, but the washes are not re-hydratable once dry. For this reason, acrylics do not lend themselves to color lifting techniques as do [[gum arabic]] based watercolor paints.

[[Image:Www Beo cc.jpg|thumb|Fluorescent acrylic paints lit by UV light. Paintings by Beo Beyond]]

Acrylic paints with gloss or matte finishes are available, although a satin (semi-matte) sheen is most common; some brands exhibit a range of finish (e.g., heavy-body paints from [[Golden Artist Colors|Golden]], [[Liquitex]], and [[Winsor &amp; Newton]]). As with oils, pigment amounts, and particle size or shape can naturally affect the paint sheen. Matting agents can also be added during manufacture to dull the finish. The artist can mix media with their paints and use topcoats or varnishes to alter or unify sheen if desired.

When dry, acrylic paint is generally non-removable from a solid surface. Water or mild solvents do not re-solubilize it, although [[isopropyl alcohol]] can lift some fresh paint films off.  [[Toluene]] and [[acetone]] can remove paint films, but they do not lift paint stains very well and are not selective. The use of a solvent to remove paint will result in removal of all of the paint layers, acrylic [[gesso]], etc. Oils can remove acrylic paint from skin.&lt;ref&gt;Removing Acrylic Paint From Skin [http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf419156.tip.html] Instructions accessed December 08, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a proper, artist-grade acrylic gesso should be used to prime canvas in preparation for painting with acrylic. It is important to avoid adding non-stable or non-archival elements to the gesso upon application. However, the viscosity of acrylic can successfully be reduced by using suitable extenders that maintain the integrity of the paint film. There are [[Acrylic retarder|retarder]]s to slow drying and extend workability time and flow releases to increase color-blending ability.

== Painters and acrylic ==
Prior to the 19th century, artists mixed their own paints to increase the longevity of the artwork and achieve desired pigment load, viscosity, and to control the use of fillers, if any. While suitable media and raw pigments are available for the individual production of acrylic paint, due to the fast drying time and other technical issues, hand mixing may not be practical.

Acrylic painters modify the appearance, hardness, flexibility, texture, and other characteristics of the paint surface using acrylic media or by simply adding water. Watercolor and oil painters also use various media, but the range of acrylic media is much greater. Acrylics have the ability to bond to many different surfaces, and media can be used to adjust their binding characteristics. Acrylic can be used on paper, canvas and a range of other materials. However, their use on engineered woods such as [[Medium-density fibreboard]] can be problematic because of the porous nature of those surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Sealing, Staining, and Filling [http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/HI_27.pdf] Wood Finishing and Refinishing accessed December 08, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases it is recommended that the surface should be previously sealed with an appropriate sealer. They can be applied in thin layers or washes creating effects that resemble watercolors and other water-based media. They can also be used to build thick layers of paint: gel and molding paste media are sometimes used to create paintings with relief features that are literally sculptural. Acrylic paints are also used in hobbies such as: train, car, house, and human models. People who make such models use acrylic paint to build facial features on dolls or raised details on other types of models.

Acrylic paints are the most common paints used in [[surrealist techniques#Grattage|grattage]]. Grattage is a surrealist technique that became popular with the release of acrylic paint. Acrylics are used for this purpose because they easily scrape or peel from a surface.&lt;ref&gt;Grattage [http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Grattage] Art Techniques accessed December 08, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between acrylic and oil paint ==
[[Image:Sapuan akrilik.jpg|thumb]]
The vehicle and binder of [[oil paint]]s is [[linseed oil]] or another [[drying oil]], whereas water serves as the vehicle for an [[emulsion]] (suspension) of acrylic polymer that is the binder in acrylic paint. Thus, oil paint is said to be &quot;oil-based&quot;, while acrylic paint is &quot;water-based&quot; (or sometimes &quot;water-borne&quot;).

The main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time.  Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over underpaintings. This slow drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain techniques, but in other regards it impedes the artist trying to work quickly. The fast evaporation of water from regular acrylic paint films can be slowed with the use of [[acrylic retarder]]s. Retarders are generally glycol or glycerin-based additives. The addition of a retarder slows the evaporation rate of the water.

Oil paints may require the use of solvents such as mineral spirits or [[turpentine]] to thin the paint and clean up; these generally have some level of toxicity and are often found objectionable.  (Relatively recently, water-miscible oil paints have been developed for artists' use.) Oil paint films can become increasing yellow and brittle with time and lose much of their flexibility in a few decades. Additionally, the rules of &quot;[[fat over lean]]&quot; must be employed to ensure the paint films are durable.

Oil paint has a higher pigment load because it is able to absorb substantially more pigment than acrylic because linseed oil has a smaller molecule than does acrylic.&lt;ref&gt;What is Acrylic Paint? [http://www.tititudorancea.com/z/what_is_acrylic_paint.htm] History and Techniques, accessed December 08, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Oil provides a different (less clear) refractive index than acrylic dispersions, imparting a unique &quot;look and feel&quot; to the resultant paint film.&lt;ref&gt;What is Acrylic Paint? [http://www.tititudorancea.com/z/what_is_acrylic_paint.htm] History and Techniques, accessed December 08, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Not all pigments in oil are available in acrylic.[[Prussian blue]] has been recently added to the acrylic colors. On the other hand there are no fluorescent oil paints like in acrylic.

Due to acrylic's more flexible nature and more consistent drying time between colors, the painter does not have to follow the &quot;fat over lean&quot; rule of oil painting, where more medium must be applied to each layer to avoid cracking. While canvas needs to be properly sized and primed before painting with oil (otherwise it will eventually rot the canvas), acrylic can be safely applied to raw canvas. The rapid drying of the paint tends to discourage the blending of color and use of [[wet-in-wet]] technique as in oil painting. While acrylic retarders can slow drying time to several hours, it remains a relatively fast-drying medium, and the addition of too much acrylic retarder can prevent the paint from ever drying properly.

Although the permanency of acrylics is sometimes debated by conservators, they appear more stable than oil paints. Oil paints fade in color and develop a yellow tint over time; they also begin to crack with age. Acrylic paints have only been around for fifty years, but within this time frame they have yet to alter in ways seen in oil paint. The changes seen in using oil paint is caused by the binder of the paint (linseed oil). Linseed oil dries as an inelastic film. As temperatures rise and fall, this film cracks. Acrylic paint is very elastic, which prevents cracking from occurring. Acrylic paint's binder is acrylic polymer emulsion; as this binder dries the paint remains flexible.&lt;ref&gt;Acrylic Paint Common Questions [http://www.liquitex.com/techniques/liquitexqa.cfm] Technical Summary of Acrylic Paint accessed December 06, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Another difference between oil and acrylic paints is the versatility offered by acrylic paints - acrylic is very useful in mixed media, allowing use of pastel (oil &amp; chalk), charcoal, pen, etc. on top of the dried acrylic painted surface. Mixing other bodies into the acrylic is possible - sand, rice, even pasta may be incorporated in the artwork. Mixing artist or student quality acrylic paint with household acrylic emulsions is possible, allowing the use of pre-mixed tints straight from the tube or tin, so presenting the painter with a vast color range at his or her disposal. This versatility is also illustrated in the wide variety of additional artistic uses that acrylics afford the artist. Specialist acrylics have been manufactured and used for lino block printing (acrylic block printing ink produced by Derivan since the early 1980s), face painting, airbrushing, water color techniques, fabric screen printing and the list goes on.

In [[physics]], '''angular momentum''', '''moment of momentum''', or '''rotational momentum'''&lt;ref&gt;Truesdell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith &amp; Truesdell&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[conservation law|conserved]] [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity that can be used to describe the overall state of a physical system. The angular momentum '''L''' of a particle with respect to some point of origin is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{r} \times m\mathbf{v}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''r''' is the particle's [[Position (vector)|position]] from the origin, {{nowrap|'''p''' {{=}} ''m'''''v'''}} is its [[linear momentum]], and × denotes the [[cross product]].

The angular momentum of a system of particles (e.g. a rigid body) is the sum of angular momenta of the individual particles. For a [[rigid body]] rotating around an axis of symmetry (e.g. the fins of a ceiling fan), the angular momentum can be expressed as the product of the body's [[moment of inertia]] ''I'' (a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotation rate) and its [[angular velocity]] '''ω''':
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = I \boldsymbol{\omega} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

In this way, angular momentum is sometimes described as the rotational analog of [[linear momentum]].

Angular momentum is [[conservation laws|conserved]] in a system where there is no net external [[torque]], and its conservation helps explain many diverse phenomena.  For example, the increase in rotational speed of a spinning figure skater as the skater's arms are contracted is a consequence of conservation of angular momentum.  The very high rotational rates of [[neutron star]]s can also be explained in terms of angular momentum conservation. Moreover, angular momentum conservation has numerous applications in physics and engineering (e.g. the [[gyrocompass]]).

[[File:Torque animation.gif|frame|right|Relationship between [[force]] (F), [[torque]] (τ), [[momentum]] (p), and angular momentum (L) vectors in a rotating system]]

===Definition===

The angular momentum '''L''' of a particle about a given origin is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''r''' is the position vector of the particle relative to the origin, '''p''' is the [[Momentum|linear momentum]] of the particle, and × denotes the [[cross product]].

As seen from the definition, the [[derived SI unit]]s of angular momentum are [[newton (unit)|newton]] [[metre]] [[second]]s (N·m·s or kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) or [[joule]] [[second]]s. Because of the cross product, '''L''' is a [[pseudovector]] perpendicular to both the radial vector '''r''' and the momentum vector '''p''' and it is assigned a sign by the [[right-hand rule]].

For an object with a fixed mass that is rotating about a fixed symmetry axis, the angular momentum is expressed as the product of the [[moment of inertia]] of the object and its angular velocity vector:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}= I \boldsymbol{\omega} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''I'' is the [[moment of inertia]] of the object (in general, a [[tensor]] quantity), and '''ω''' is the [[angular velocity]].

The angular momentum of a particle or rigid body in rectilinear motion (pure translation) is a vector with constant magnitude and direction.  If the path of the particle or rigid body passes through the given origin, its angular momentum is zero.

Angular momentum is also known as [[moment (physics)|moment]] of [[momentum]].

=== Angular momentum of a collection of particles ===

If a system consists of several particles, the total angular momentum about a point can be obtained by adding (or integrating) all the angular momenta of the constituent particles.

=== Angular momentum simplified using the center of mass===
It is very often convenient to consider the angular momentum of a collection of particles about their [[center of mass]], since this simplifies the mathematics considerably. The angular momentum of a collection of particles is the sum of the angular momentum of each particle:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\sum_i \mathbf{R}_i\times m_i \mathbf{V}_i&lt;/math&gt;

where '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the position vector of particle ''i'' from the reference point, ''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is its mass, and '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is its velocity. The center of mass is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=\frac{1}{M}\sum_i m_i \mathbf{R}_i&lt;/math&gt;

where the total mass of all particles is given by

:&lt;math&gt;M=\sum_i m_i.\,&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that the velocity of the center of mass is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}=\frac{1}{M}\sum_i m_i \mathbf{V}_i.\,&lt;/math&gt;

If we define '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; as the displacement of particle ''i'' from the center of mass, and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; as the velocity of particle ''i'' with respect to the center of mass, then we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_i=\mathbf{R}+\mathbf{r}_i\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}_i=\mathbf{V}+\mathbf{v}_i\,&lt;/math&gt;

and also

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i m_i \mathbf{r}_i=0\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\sum_i m_i \mathbf{v}_i=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

so that the total angular momentum with respect to the center is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\sum_i (\mathbf{R}+\mathbf{r}_i)\times m_i (\mathbf{V}+\mathbf{v}_i) = \left(\mathbf{R}\times M\mathbf{V}\right) + \left(\sum_i \mathbf{r}_i\times m_i \mathbf{v}_i\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is just the angular momentum of the center of mass. It is the same angular momentum one would obtain if there were just one particle of mass ''M'' moving at velocity '''V''' located at the center of mass. The second term is the angular momentum that is the result of the particles moving relative to their center of mass. This second term can be even further simplified if the particles form a [[rigid body]], in which case it is the product of [[moment of inertia]] and [[angular velocity]] of the spinning motion (as above). The same result is true if the discrete point masses discussed above are replaced by a continuous distribution of matter.

=== Fixed axis of rotation ===

For many applications where one is only concerned about rotation around one axis, it is sufficient to discard the pseudovector nature of angular momentum, and treat it like a scalar where it is positive when it corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation, and negative clockwise. To do this, just take the definition of the cross product and discard the unit vector, so that angular momentum becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;L = |\mathbf{r}||\mathbf{p}|\sin	\theta_{r,p}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''r'',''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the angle between '''r''' and '''p''' measured from '''r''' to '''p'''; an important distinction because without it, the sign of the cross product would be meaningless. From the above, it is possible to reformulate the definition to either of the following:

:&lt;math&gt;L = \pm|\mathbf{p}||\mathbf{r}_{\perp}|&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_{\perp}&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''[[lever]] arm distance'' to '''p'''.

The easiest way to conceptualize this is to consider the lever arm distance to be the distance from the origin to the line that '''p''' travels along. With this definition, it is necessary to consider the direction of '''p''' (pointed clockwise or counter-clockwise) to figure out the sign of L. Equivalently:

:&lt;math&gt;L = \pm|\mathbf{r}||\mathbf{p}_{\perp}|&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_{\perp}&lt;/math&gt; is the component of '''p''' that is perpendicular to '''r'''. As above, the sign is decided based on the sense of rotation.

For an object with a fixed mass that is rotating about a fixed symmetry axis,
the angular momentum is expressed as the product of the [[moment of inertia]] of the object and its angular
velocity vector:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}= I \boldsymbol{\omega} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''I'' is the [[moment of inertia]] of the object (in general, a [[tensor]] quantity) and '''ω''' is the [[angular velocity]].

It is a misconception that angular momentum is always about the same axis as angular velocity.  Sometime this may not be possible, in these cases the angular momentum component along the axis of rotation is the product of angular velocity and moment of inertia about the given axis of rotation.

As the [[kinetic energy]] ''K'' of a massive rotating body is given by

:&lt;math&gt;K = I\omega^2/2 &lt;/math&gt;

it is proportional to the square of the angular velocity.

===Conservation of angular momentum===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Conservation law]] --&gt;&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Stress (mechanics]] --&gt;
[[File:PrecessionOfATop.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[torque]] caused by the two opposing forces '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and -'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; causes a change in the angular momentum '''L''' in the direction of that torque (since torque is the time derivative of angular momentum). This causes the top to [[precess]].]]

In a closed system angular momentum is constant. This conservation law mathematically follows from continuous directional symmetry of space (no direction in space is any different from any other direction). See [[Noether's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The classical theory of fields&quot;, L.D. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz( Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 1995) ISBN 0-7506-2768-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The time derivative of angular momentum is called [[torque]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{L}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}}{\mathrm{d}t} \times \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{r} \times \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t} = 0 + \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}  = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F} &lt;/math&gt;

(The cross-product of velocity and momentum is zero, because these vectors are parallel.) So requiring the system to be &quot;closed&quot; here is mathematically equivalent to zero external torque acting on the system:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{\mathrm{system}} =  \mathrm{constant} \leftrightarrow \sum \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{ext}} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_{ext}&lt;/math&gt; is any torque applied to the system of particles.
It is assumed that internal interaction forces obey [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law of motion]] in its strong form, that is, that the forces between particles are equal and opposite and act along the line between the particles.

In orbits, the angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet itself and the angular momentum of its orbit:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{\mathrm{total}} = \mathbf{L}_{\mathrm{spin}} + \mathbf{L}_{\mathrm{orbit}}
&lt;/math&gt;;

If a planet is found to rotate slower than expected, then astronomers suspect that the planet is accompanied by a satellite, because the total angular momentum is shared between the planet and its satellite in order to be conserved.

The conservation of angular momentum is used extensively in analyzing what is called ''central force motion''. If the net force on some body is directed always toward some fixed point, the ''center'', then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, and so the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. Constant angular momentum is extremely useful when dealing with the [[orbit]]s of [[planet]]s and [[satellite]]s, and also when analyzing the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]].

The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is constant in the absence of external torques, the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater has to increase.

The same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s) when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars (indeed, decreasing the size of object 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;).

The conservation of angular momentum in Earth–Moon system results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon (due to tidal torque the Moon exerts on the Earth). This in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth (at about 42 nsec/day), and in gradual increase of the radius of Moon's orbit (at ~4.5&amp;nbsp;cm/year rate).

== Angular momentum in relativistic mechanics ==

In modern (late 20th century) theoretical physics, angular momentum is described using a different formalism. Under this formalism, angular momentum is the [[2-form]] [[Noether charge]] associated with rotational invariance (As a result, angular momentum is not conserved for general curved spacetimes, unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariant). For a system of point particles without any intrinsic angular momentum, it turns out to be

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i \bold{r}_i\wedge \bold{p}_i&lt;/math&gt;

(Here, the [[wedge product]] is used.).

== Angular momentum in quantum mechanics ==

In [[quantum mechanics]], angular momentum is [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] – that is, it cannot vary continuously, but only in &quot;[[Quantum state|quantum leaps]]&quot;  between certain allowed values. The orbital angular momentum of a subatomic particle, that is due to its motion through space, is always a whole-number multiple of &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; (&quot;h-bar,&quot; known as the [[reduced Planck's constant]]). Furthermore, experiments show that most subatomic particles have a permanent, built-in angular momentum, which is not due to their motion through space. This [[spin (physics)|spin]] angular momentum comes in units of &lt;math&gt;\hbar/2&lt;/math&gt;. For example, an electron standing at rest has an angular momentum of &lt;math&gt;\hbar/2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Basic definition===

The classical definition of angular momentum as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;  depends on six numbers: &lt;math&gt;r_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r_y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r_z&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;p_z&lt;/math&gt;. Translating this into quantum-mechanical terms, the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] tells us that it is not possible for all six of these numbers to be measured simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Therefore, there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle's angular momentum. It turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector's magnitude and its component along one axis.

Mathematically, angular momentum in quantum mechanics is defined like [[momentum#Momentum in quantum mechanics|momentum]] - not as a quantity but as an [[operator (physics)|operator]] on the [[wave function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''r''' and '''p''' are the position and momentum operators respectively. In particular, for a single particle with no [[electric charge]] and no [[spin (physics)|spin]], the [[angular momentum operator]] can be written in the position basis as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=-i\hbar(\mathbf{r}\times\nabla)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the vector [[differential operator]] [[del]] (also called &quot;[[nabla symbol|Nabla]]&quot;). This ''orbital angular momentum operator'' is the most commonly encountered form of the angular momentum operator, though not the only one. It satisfies the following [[canonical commutation relation]]s:&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=dRsvmTFpB3wC&amp;pg=PA171 Quantum Mechanics, by G. Aruldhas, p171, formula (8.8)]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[L_l, L_m ] = i \hbar \sum_{n=1}^{3} \varepsilon_{lmn} L_n&lt;/math&gt;,

where
*ε&lt;sub&gt;lmn&lt;/sub&gt; is the (antisymmetric) [[Levi-Civita symbol]],
*&lt;math&gt;[X,Y]=XY-YX&lt;/math&gt; is the [[commutator]].

From this follows
:&lt;math&gt;\left[L_i, L^2 \right] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Since,
:&lt;math&gt;L_x = -i\hbar \left(y {\partial\over \partial z} - z {\partial\over \partial y}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_y = -i\hbar \left(z {\partial\over \partial x} - x {\partial\over \partial z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_z = -i\hbar \left(x {\partial\over \partial y} - y {\partial\over \partial x}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

it follows, for example,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left[L_x,L_y\right] &amp; = -\hbar^2 \left( \left(y {\partial \over \partial z} - z {\partial\over \partial y}\right)\left(z {\partial\over \partial x} - x {\partial\over \partial z}\right) - \left(z {\partial\over \partial x} - x {\partial\over \partial z}\right)\left(y {\partial \over \partial z} - z {\partial\over \partial y}\right)\right) \\
      &amp; = -\hbar^2 \left( y {\partial\over \partial x} - x {\partial\over \partial y}\right) = i \hbar L_z. \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Addition of quantized angular momenta===
{{details|Clebsch-Gordan coefficients}}
Given a quantized total angular momentum &lt;math&gt;\vec{j}&lt;/math&gt; which is the sum of two individual quantized angular momenta &lt;math&gt;\vec{l_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{l_2}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{j} = \vec{l_1} + \vec{l_2}&lt;/math&gt;

the [[quantum number]] &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; associated with its magnitude can range from &lt;math&gt;|l_1 - l_2|&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;l_1 + l_2&lt;/math&gt; in integer steps
where &lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l_2&lt;/math&gt; are quantum numbers corresponding to the magnitudes of the individual angular momenta.

===Angular momentum as a generator of rotations===
If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the angle around a specific axis, for example the azimuthal angle around the z axis, then the angular momentum along this axis is the [[Noether's theorem|generator]] of rotations around this axis:
:&lt;math&gt;L_z = -i\hbar {\partial\over \partial \phi}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[eigenfunction]]s of L&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; are therefore &lt;math&gt;e^{i m_l \phi}&lt;/math&gt;, and since &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; has a period of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, m&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; must be an integer.

For a particle with a [[Spin (physics)|spin]] '''S''', this takes into account only the angular dependence of the location of the particle, for example its orbit in an atom. It is therefore known as [[orbital angular momentum]]. However, when one rotates the system, one also changes the [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. Therefore the [[total angular momentum]], which is the full [[Noether's theorem|generator]] of rotations, [[Azimuthal_quantum_number#Total_angular_momentum_of_an_electron_in_the_atom|is]]
&lt;math&gt;J_i = L_i + S_i&lt;/math&gt;
Being an angular momentum, '''J''' satisfies the same commutation relations as L, as will be explained below, namely&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=dRsvmTFpB3wC&amp;pg=PA173 Quantum Mechanics, by G. Aruldhas, p173, eqn (8.20)]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[J_\ell, J_m ] = i \hbar \sum_{n=1}^{3} \varepsilon_{lmn} J_n&lt;/math&gt;
from which follows
:&lt;math&gt;\left[J_\ell, J^2 \right] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Acting with J on the [[wavefunction]] &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; of a particle generates a rotation:
&lt;math&gt;e^{i \phi J_z} \psi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavefunction]] &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; rotated around the z axis by an angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. For an infinitesmal rotation by an angle &lt;math&gt;d\phi&lt;/math&gt;, the rotated [[wavefunction]] is &lt;math&gt;\psi+ i d\phi J_z \psi&lt;/math&gt;. This is similarly true for rotations around any axis.

In a charged particle the momentum [[Momentum#Momentum_in_electromagnetism|gets a contribution from the electromagnetic field]], and the angular momenta '''L''' and '''J''' change accordingly.

If the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is invariant under rotations, as in spherically symmetric problems, then according to [[Noether's theorem]], it [[commutator|commutes]] with the [[total angular momentum]]. So the total angular momentum is a [[conserved quantity]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left[J_l, H \right] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Since angular momentum is the generator of rotations, its commutation relations follow the commutation relations of the generators of the three-dimensional [[rotation group]] [[Orthogonal group|SO(3)]]. This is why '''J''' always satisfies these commutation relations. In '''d''' dimensions, the angular momentum will satisfy the same commutation relations as the generators of the '''d'''-dimensional rotation group [[Orthogonal group|SO(d)]].

[[SO(3)]] has the same [[Lie algebra]] (i.e. the same commutation relations) as [[SU(2)]]. Generators of [[SU(2)]] can have half-integer [[eigenvalues]], and so can m&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed for [[fermion]]s the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] '''S''' and [[total angular momentum]] '''J''' are half-integer. In fact this is the most general case: j and m&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; are either integers or half-integers.

Technically, this is because the [[universal cover]] of SO(3) is [[isomorphic]] to [[SU(2)]], and the [[Representation theory of SU(2)|representation]]s of the latter are fully known. '''J&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' span the [[Lie algebra]] and '''J&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' is the [[Casimir invariant]], and it can be shown that if the [[eigenvalues]] of '''J&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''J&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' are m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and j(j+1) then m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and j are both integer multiples of one-half. j is non-negative and m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; takes values between -j and j.

===Relation to spherical harmonics===
Angular momentum operators usually occur when solving a problem with [[spherical symmetry]] in [[spherical coordinates]]. Then, the angular momentum in space representation is:
:: &lt;math&gt;L^2 = -\frac{\hbar^2}{\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\left( \sin\theta \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right) - \frac{\hbar^2}{\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \phi^2} &lt;/math&gt;
When solving to find [[eigenstate]]s of this operator, we obtain the following
:: &lt;math&gt; L^2 | l, m \rang = {\hbar}^2 l(l+1) | l, m \rang &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; L_z | l, m \rang = \hbar m | l, m \rang &lt;/math&gt;
where
::&lt;math&gt; \lang \theta , \phi | l, m \rang = Y_{l,m}(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;
are the [[spherical harmonic]]s.

Thus, a particle whose wave function is the [[spherical harmonic]] &lt;math&gt;Y_{l,m}&lt;/math&gt; has an orbital angular momentum

:: &lt;math&gt; L  = {\hbar} \sqrt{l(l+1)} &lt;/math&gt;

with a z-component

:: &lt;math&gt; L_z = {\hbar} m &lt;/math&gt;

==Angular momentum in electrodynamics==
When describing the motion of a charged particle in the presence of an [[electromagnetic field]], the [[canonical momentum]] ''p'' is not [[gauge invariant]]. As a consequence, the canonical angular momentum &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times  \mathbf{p} &lt;/math&gt; is not gauge invariant either. Instead, the momentum that is physical, the so-called kinetic momentum, is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} -\frac {e \mathbf{A} }{c}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electric charge]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]] and ''A'' the [[vector potential]]. Thus, for example, the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of a charged particle of mass ''m'' in an electromagnetic field is then

:&lt;math&gt; H =\frac{1}{2m} \left( \mathbf{p} -\frac {e \mathbf{A} }{c}\right)^2 + e\phi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scalar potential]]. This is the Hamiltonian that gives the [[Lorentz force law]]. The gauge-invariant angular momentum, or &quot;kinetic angular momentum&quot; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;K= \mathbf{r} \times \left( \mathbf{p} -\frac {e \mathbf{A} }{c}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The interplay with quantum mechanics is discussed further in the article on  [[canonical commutation relation]]s.

The '''plum pudding model''' of the [[atom]]  by [[J. J. Thomson]], who discovered the [[electron]] in 1897, was proposed in 1904 before the discovery of the atomic nucleus. In this model, the atom is composed of electrons (which Thomson still called &quot;corpuscles&quot;, though [[G. J. Stoney]] had proposed that atoms of electricity be called ''electrons'' in 1894&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) surrounded by a soup of positive charge to balance the electrons' negative charges, like negatively-charged &quot;[[plum]]s&quot; surrounded by positively-charged &quot;[[pudding]]&quot;. The electrons (as we know them today) were thought to be positioned throughout the atom, but with many structures possible for positioning multiple electrons, particularly rotating rings of electrons (see below). Instead of a soup, the atom was also sometimes said to have had a &quot;cloud&quot; of positive charge. 

With this model, Thomson abandoned his earlier &quot;nebular atom&quot; hypothesis in which the atom was composed of immaterial vorticies. Now, at least part of the atom was to be composed of Thomson's particulate negative corpuscles, although the rest of the positively-charged part of the atom remained somewhat nebulous and ill-defined.

The 1904 Thomson model was disproved by the 1909 [[Geiger-Marsden experiment|gold foil experiment]], which was interpreted by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1911&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to imply a very small nucleus of the atom containing a very high positive charge (in the case of gold, enough to balance about 100 electrons), thus leading to the [[Rutherford model]] of the atom. Although gold has an atomic number of 79, immediately after Rutherford's paper appeared in 1911 [[Antonius Van den Broek]] made the intuitive suggestion that atomic number '''is''' nuclear charge. The matter required experiment to decide. [[Henry Moseley]]'s work showed experimentally in 1913 (see [[Moseley's law]]) that the effective nuclear charge was very close to the atomic number (Moseley found only one unit difference), and Moseley referenced only the papers of Van den Broek and Rutherford. This work culminated in the solar-system-like (but quantum-limited) [[Bohr model]] of the atom in the same year, in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charge is surrounded by an equal number of electrons in orbital shells. Bohr had also inspired Moseley's work.

Thomson's model was compared (though not by Thomson) to a British dessert called [[Christmas pudding|plum pudding]], hence the name. Thomson's paper was published in the March 1904 edition of the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', the leading British science journal of the day.  In Thomson's view:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''... the atoms of the elements consist of a number of negatively electrified corpuscles enclosed in a sphere of uniform positive electrification, ...''&lt;ref&gt;

In this model, the electrons were free to rotate within the blob or cloud of positive substance. These orbits were stabilized in the model by the fact that when an electron moved farther from the center of the positive cloud, it felt a larger net positive inward force, because there was more material of opposite charge, inside its orbit (see [[Gauss's law]]). In Thomson's model, electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions between the electrons, and spectra were to be accounted for by energy differences of different ring orbits. Thomson attempted to make his model account for some of the major spectral lines known for some elements, but was not notably successful at this. Still, Thomson's model (along with a similar [[Saturnian model|Saturnian ring model for atomic electrons]], also put forward in 1904 by [[Hantaro Nagaoka|Nagaoka]] after [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s [[Rings of Saturn#History|model of Saturn's rings]]), were earlier harbingers of the later and more successful solar-system-like [[Bohr model]] of the atom.

In [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], '''atomic theory''' is a [[theory]] of the nature of [[matter]], which states that matter is composed of discrete units called [[atom]]s, as opposed to the obsolete notion that matter could be divided into any arbitrarily small quantity. It began as a philosophical concept in ancient Greece ([[Democritus]]) and [[India]] and entered the scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]] in the field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of particles.

The word &quot;atom&quot; (from the ancient Greek adjective ''atomos'', 'indivisible'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Berryman, Sylvia|title=Ancient Atomism, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2008|editor=Edward N. Zalta|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/atomism-ancient/}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was applied to the basic particle that constituted a chemical element, because the chemists of the era believed that these were the [[fundamental particle]]s of matter. However, around the turn of the 20th century, through various experiments with [[electromagnetism]] and [[radioactivity]], physicists discovered that the so-called &quot;indivisible atom&quot; was actually a conglomerate of various [[subatomic particle]]s (chiefly, [[electrons]], [[protons]] and [[neutrons]]) which can exist separately from each other. In fact, in certain extreme environments such as [[neutron stars]], extreme temperature and pressure prevents atoms from existing at all. Since atoms were found to be actually divisible, physicists later invented the term &quot;[[elementary particle]]s&quot; to describe indivisible particles. The field of science which studies subatomic particles is [[particle physics]], and it is in this field that physicists hope to discover the true fundamental nature of matter.

==Modern atomic theory==
===Earliest empirical evidence===
Near the end of the 18th century, two laws about chemical reactions emerged without referring to the notion of an atomic theory. The first was the [[conservation of mass|law of conservation of mass]], formulated by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in 1789, which states that the total mass in a chemical reaction remains constant (that is, the reactants have the same mass as the products).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lavoisier&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Weisstein, Eric W. |url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Lavoisier.html |title=Lavoisier, Antoine (1743-1794)] |publisher=scienceworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was the [[law of definite proportions]]. First proven by the French chemist [[Joseph Louis Proust]] in 1799,&lt;ref name=&quot;proust&quot;&gt;Proust, Joseph Louis. &quot;[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/proust.html Researches on Copper]&quot;, excerpted from ''Ann. chim.'' 32, 26-54 (1799) [as translated and reproduced in Henry M. Leicester and Herbert S. Klickstein, ''A Source Book in Chemistry'', 1400-1900 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard, 1952)]. Retrieved on August 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; this law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent elements, then the masses of the constituents will always have the same proportions, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance.

[[John Dalton]] studied and expanded upon this previous work and developed the [[law of multiple proportions]]: if two elements can together form more than one compound, then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small [[integers]].  For instance, Proust had studied [[tin oxide (disambiguation)|tin oxide]]s and found that their masses were either 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen or 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (these were [[tin(II) oxide]] and [[tin dioxide]] respectively). Dalton noted from these percentages that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen; 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2. Dalton found an atomic theory of matter could elegantly explain this common pattern in chemistry - in the case of Proust's tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;From AtomosToAtom&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew G. van Melsen |year=1952 |title=From Atomos to Atom |isbn= 0486495841 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=Mineola, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbed different gases in different proportions: for example, he found that water absorbed [[carbon dioxide]] far better than it absorbed [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Dalton_1803_paper&quot;&gt;Dalton, John. &quot;[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/dalton52.html On the Absorption of Gases by Water and Other Liquids]&quot;, in ''Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester''. 1803. Retrieved on August 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences in mass and complexity of the gases' respective particles. Indeed, carbon dioxide molecules (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Dalton proposed that each chemical element is composed of atoms of a single, unique type, and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means, they can combine to form more complex structures ([[chemical compound]]s). This marked the first truly scientific theory of the atom, since Dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination of the results in an empirical fashion.

[[File:Daltons symbols.gif|right|thumb|Various atoms and molecules as depicted in [[John Dalton|John Dalton's]] ''A New System of Chemical Philosophy'' (1808).]]
In 1803 Dalton orally presented his first list of relative atomic weights for a number of substances. This paper was published in 1805, but he did not discuss there exactly how he obtained these figures.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dalton_1803_paper&quot;/&gt; The method was first revealed in 1807 by his acquaintance [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]], in the third edition of Thomson's textbook, ''A System of Chemistry''. Finally, Dalton published a full account in his own textbook, ''A New System of Chemical Philosophy'', 1808 and 1810.

Dalton estimated the atomic weights according to the mass ratios in which they combined, with hydrogen being the basic unit. However, Dalton did not conceive that with some elements atoms exist in molecules — e.g. pure oxygen exists as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. He also mistakenly believed that the simplest compound between any two elements is always one atom of each (so he thought water was HO, not H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Johnson, Chris|url=http://www.bulldog.u-net.com/avogadro/avoga.html|title=Avogadro - his contribution to chemistry|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in addition to the crudity of his equipment, resulted in his table being highly flawed. For instance, he believed oxygen atoms were 5.5 times heavier than hydrogen atoms, because in water he measured 5.5&amp;nbsp;grams of oxygen for every 1&amp;nbsp;gram of hydrogen and believed the formula for water was HO (an oxygen atom is actually 16 times heavier than a hydrogen atom).

The flaw in Dalton's theory was corrected in 1811 by [[Amedeo Avogadro]]. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain equal numbers of molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles does not affect its volume).&lt;ref name=&quot;avogadro&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Avogadro, Amedeo|url=http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/avogadro.html |title=Essay on a Manner of Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies, and the Proportions in Which They Enter into These Compounds|year=1811. |journal=Journal de Physique|volume=73|pages=58–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avogadro's law]] allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and firmly established the distinction between molecules and atoms.

In 1827, the British botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] observed that dust particles inside pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about for no apparent reason. In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] theorized that this [[Brownian motion]] was caused by the water molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a hypothetical mathematical model to describe it.&lt;ref name=&quot;einstein&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=A.|title=Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=322|pages=549|year=1905|doi=10.1002/andp.19053220806|bibcode = 1905AnP...322..549E }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist [[Jean Perrin]], thus providing additional validation for particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).

Atoms were thought to be the smallest possible division of matter until 1897 when [[J.J. Thomson]] discovered the [[electron]] through his work on [[cathode ray]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thomson, J.J. |url=http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/thomson1897.html |title=Cathode rays|journal=Philosophical Magazine|volume=44|page=293|year=1897 |format=[facsimile from Stephen Wright, Classical Scientific Papers, Physics (Mills and Boon, 1964)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Crookes tube]] is a sealed glass container in which two [[electrode]]s are separated by a [[vacuum]]. When a [[voltage]] is applied across the electrodes, cathode rays are generated, creating a glowing patch where they strike the glass at the opposite end of the tube. Through experimentation, Thomson discovered that the rays could be deflected by an [[electric field]] (in addition to [[magnetic field]]s, which was already known). He concluded that these rays, rather than being a form of light, were composed of very light [[electric charge|negatively charged]] particles he called &quot;corpuscles&quot; (they would later be renamed electrons by other scientists).

Thomson believed that the corpuscles emerged from the molecules of gas around the cathode. He thus concluded that atoms were divisible, and that the corpuscles were their building blocks. To explain the overall neutral charge of the atom, he proposed that the corpuscles were distributed in a uniform sea of positive charge; this was the [[plum pudding model]]&lt;ref name=&quot;thomson2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thomson, J.J. |url=http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Thomson-Structure-Atom.html|title=On the Structure of the Atom: an Investigation of the Stability and Periods of Oscillation of a number of Corpuscles arranged at equal intervals around the Circumference of a Circle; with Application of the Results to the Theory of Atomic Structure|journal=Philosophical Magazine|year= 1904|volume= 7|page=237|doi=10.1080/14786440409463107}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the electrons were embedded in the positive charge like plums in a plum pudding (although in Thomson's model they were not stationary).

===Discovery of the nucleus===
{{Main|Rutherford model}}
[[File:Gold foil experiment conclusions.svg|right|thumb|'''The gold foil experiment'''&lt;br&gt; ''Top:'' Expected results: alpha particles passing through the plum pudding model of the atom with negligible deflection.&lt;br&gt; ''Bottom:'' Observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected by the concentrated positive charge of the nucleus.]]
Thomson's [[plum pudding model]] was disproved in 1909 by one of his former students, [[Ernest Rutherford]], who discovered that most of the mass and positive charge of an atom is concentrated in a very small fraction of its volume, which he assumed to be at the very center.

In the [[Geiger-Marsden experiment|gold foil experiment]], [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]] (colleagues of Rutherford working at his behest) shot [[alpha particle]]s at a thin sheet of [[gold]], measuring their deflection with a [[fluorescence|fluorescent screen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;geiger&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geiger, H|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Geiger-1910.html|title=The Scattering of the α-Particles by Matter|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|year= 1910|volume= A 83|pages= 492–504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high [[momentum]] of the alpha particles and the unconcentrated distribution of positive charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the gold sheet without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection.

This led Rutherford to propose a [[Rutherford model|planetary model]] in which a cloud of electrons surrounded a small, compact nucleus of positive charge. Only such a concentration of charge could produce the electric field strong enough to cause the heavy deflection.&lt;ref name=&quot;rutherford&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rutherford, Ernest|title=The Scattering of a and ß Particles by Matter and the Structure of the Atom|journal=Philosophical Magazine|year=1911|volume=21|page=669|url=http://www.ffn.ub.es/luisnavarro/nuevo_maletin/Rutherford%20(1911),%20Structure%20atom%20.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First steps toward a quantum physical model of the atom===
{{Main|Bohr model}}
The planetary model of the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating [[electric charge]] is known to emit [[electromagnetic wave]]s according to the [[Larmor formula]] in [[classical electromagnetism]]; an orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in a small fraction of a second. The second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked [[Emission spectrum|emission]] and [[Absorption spectrum|absorption spectra]] of atoms that were observed. 

[[File:Bohr atom model English.svg|thumb|left|The [[Bohr model]] of the atom]] 
[[Quantum mechanics|Quantum theory]] revolutionized physics at the beginning of the 20th century, when [[Max Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein]] postulated that light energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete amounts known as [[Quantum|quanta]] (singular, ''quantum''). In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] incorporated this idea into his [[Bohr model]] of the atom, in which an electron could only orbit the nucleus in particular circular orbits with fixed [[angular momentum]] and energy, its distance from the nucleus (i.e., their radii) being proportional to its energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBohr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bohr, Niels|title=On the constitution of atoms and molecules|url=http://www.ffn.ub.es/luisnavarro/nuevo_maletin/Bohr_1913.pdf|journal=Philosophical Magazine|year=1913|volume=26|pages=476–502|doi=10.1080/14786441308634993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this model an electron could not spiral into the nucleus because it could not lose energy in a continuous manner; instead, it could only make instantaneous &quot;[[Atomic electron transition|quantum leap]]s&quot; between the fixed [[energy level]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBohr&quot;/&gt; When this occurred, light was emitted or absorbed at a frequency proportional to the change in energy (hence the absorption and emission of light in discrete spectra).&lt;ref name=&quot;NBohr&quot;/&gt;

Bohr's model was not perfect. It could only predict the [[spectral line]]s of hydrogen; it couldn't predict those of multielectron atoms. Worse still, as [[Spectrophotometry|spectrographic technology]] improved, additional spectral lines in hydrogen were observed which Bohr's model couldn't explain. In 1916, [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] added elliptical orbits to the Bohr model to explain the extra emission lines, but this made the model very difficult to use, and it still couldn't explain more complex atoms.

===Discovery of isotopes===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[isotope]] was coined by [[Margaret Todd (doctor)|Margaret Todd]] as a suitable name for these elements.

That same year, [[J.J. Thomson]] conducted an experiment in which he channeled a stream of [[neon]] [[ion]]s through magnetic and electric fields, striking a photographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the plate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was because some of the neon ions had a different mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;thompson3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thomson, J.J. |url=http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/canal.html |title=Rays of positive electricity|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|year=1913|volume=A 89|pages=1–20}} [as excerpted in Henry A. Boorse &amp; Lloyd Motz, ''The World of the Atom'', Vol. 1 (New York: Basic Books, 1966)]. Retrieved on August 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of [[neutron]]s in 1932.

===Discovery of nuclear particles===
{{Main|Atomic nucleus}}
In 1918, [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]] bombarded [[nitrogen]] gas with [[alpha particle]]s and observed [[hydrogen]] nuclei being emitted from the gas. Rutherford concluded that the hydrogen nuclei emerged from the nuclei of the nitrogen atoms themselves (in effect, he split the atom).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rutherford, Ernest|url=http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/rutherford.html |title=Collisions of alpha Particles with Light Atoms. IV. An Anomalous Effect in Nitrogen|journal=Philosophical Magazine|year=1919|volume=37|page=581}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later found that the positive charge of any atom could always be equated to that of an integer number of hydrogen nuclei. This, coupled with the facts that hydrogen was the lightest element known and that the [[atomic mass]] of every other element was roughly equivalent to an integer number of hydrogen atoms, led him to conclude hydrogen nuclei were singular particles and a basic constituent of all atomic nuclei: the [[proton]]. Further experimentation by Rutherford found that the nuclear mass of most atoms exceeded that of the protons it possessed; he speculated that this surplus mass was composed of hitherto unknown neutrally charged particles, which were tentatively dubbed &quot;[[neutron]]s&quot;.

In 1928, [[Walter Bothe]] observed that [[beryllium]] emitted a highly penetrating, electrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles. It was later discovered that this radiation could knock hydrogen atoms out of [[paraffin wax]]. Initially it was thought to be high-energy [[gamma radiation]], since gamma radiation had a similar effect on electrons in metals, but [[James Chadwick]] found that the [[ionization]] effect was too strong for it to be due to electromagnetic radiation. In 1932, he exposed various elements, such as hydrogen and nitrogen, to the mysterious &quot;beryllium radiation&quot;, and by measuring the energies of the recoiling charged particles, he deduced that the radiation was actually composed of electrically neutral particles with a mass similar to that of a proton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chadwick, James|year=1932|url=http://web.mit.edu/22.54/resources/Chadwick.pdf |title=Possible Existence of a Neutron|doi=10.1038/129312a0|journal=Nature|page=312|volume=129|bibcode = 1932Natur.129Q.312C|issue=3252}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his discovery of the neutron, Chadwick received the Nobel Prize in 1935.

===Quantum physical models of the atom===
{{Main|Atomic orbital}}
[[File:AOs-1s-2pz.png|right|thumb|The five filled atomic orbitals of a neon atom, separated and arranged in order of increasing energy from left to right, with the last three orbitals being [[Degenerate energy level|equal in energy]]. Each orbital holds up to two electrons, which most probably exist in the zones represented by the colored bubbles. Each electron is equally in both orbital zones, shown here by color only to highlight the different wave phase.]]
In 1924, [[Louis de Broglie]] proposed that all moving particles — particularly subatomic particles such as electrons — exhibit a degree of wave-like behavior. [[Erwin Schrödinger]], fascinated by this idea, explored whether or not the movement of an electron in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than as a particle. [[Schrödinger's equation]], published in 1926,&lt;ref name=&quot;schrodinger&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schrödinger, Erwin|title=Quantisation as an Eigenvalue Problem|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=81|issue=18|pages=109–139|year=1926|doi=10.1002/andp.19263861802|bibcode = 1926AnP...386..109S }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes an electron as a [[wavefunction]] instead of as a point particle. This approach elegantly predicted many of the spectral phenomena that Bohr's model failed to explain. Although this concept was mathematically convenient, it was difficult to visualize, and faced opposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mahanti&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Mahanti, Subodh|url=http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/ESchrodinger.htm |title=Erwin Schrödinger: The Founder of Quantum Wave Mechanics|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its critics, [[Max Born]], proposed instead that Schrödinger's wavefunction described not the electron but rather all its possible states, and thus could be used to calculate the probability of finding an electron at any given location around the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mahanti, Subodh|url=http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/MBorn.htm |title=Max Born: Founder of Lattice Dynamics|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reconciled the two opposing theories of particle versus wave electrons and the idea of wave-particle duality was introduced. This theory stated that the electron may exhibit the properties of both a wave and a particle. For example, it can be refracted like a wave, and has mass like a particle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Greiner, Walter|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7qCMUfwoQcAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=wave-particle+all-particles&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=wave-particle%20all-particles&amp;f=false |title=Quantum Mechanics: An Introduction|accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consequence of describing electrons as waveforms is that it is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum of an electron; this became known as the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]] after the theoretical physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]], who first described it. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The [[Atomic orbital model|modern model of the atom]] describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its [[atomic orbital]]. The orbitals come in a variety of shapes-[[sphere]], [[dumbbell]], [[torus]], etc.-with the nucleus in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Milton Orchin, Roger Macomber, Allan Pinhas, R.

==Name==

Aung San Suu Kyi derives her name from three relatives: &quot;[[Aung San]]&quot; from her father, &quot;Suu&quot; from her paternal grandmother and &quot;Kyi&quot; from her mother Khin Kyi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel.org&quot;&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991/kyi-bio.html Aung San Suu Kyi&amp;nbsp;– Biography].

==Personal life==
{{Politics of Burma}}

Aung San Suu Kyi was born in Rangoon (now named [[Yangon]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://macampaign.org.uk/aboutburma/aung_san_suu_kyi.htm A biography of Aung San Suu Kyi. Burma Campaign.co.uk. Retrieved 7 May 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, [[Aung San]], founded the [[Tatmadaw|modern Burmese army]] and negotiated Burma's independence from the [[British Empire]] in 1947; he was [[Burmese Martyrs' Day|assassinated by his rivals]] in the same year. She grew up with her mother, Khin Kyi, and two brothers, Aung San Lin and [[Aung San Oo]], in Rangoon. Aung San Lin, died at age eight, when he drowned in an ornamental lake on the grounds of the house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel.org&quot; /&gt; Her elder brother emigrated to [[San Diego]], California, becoming a [[United States citizen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel.org&quot; /&gt; After Aung San Lin's death, the family moved to a house by [[Inya Lake]] where Suu Kyi met people of very different backgrounds, political views and religions.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (1997), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated in [[Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon|Methodist English High School]] (now Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon) for much of her childhood in Burma, where she was noted as having a talent for learning languages.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (1997), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; She is a [[Theravada]] [[Buddhist]].

Suu Kyi's mother, Khin Kyi, gained prominence as a political figure in the newly formed Burmese government. She was appointed Burmese ambassador to [[India]] and [[Nepal]] in 1960, and Aung San Suu Kyi followed her there, graduating from [[Lady Shri Ram College for Women|Lady Shri Ram College]] in [[New Delhi]] with a degree in politics in 1964.&lt;ref name = &quot;azjarp&quot;&gt;[http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/aboutburma/aung_san_suu_kyi.htm A biography of Aung San Suu Kyi].

After graduating, she lived in [[New York City]] with a family friend and worked at the [[United Nations]] for three years, primarily on budget matters, writing daily to her future husband, Dr. [[Michael Aris]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff reporter (18 June 2009).

''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, Aung San Suu Kyi married Aris, a scholar of [[Tibetan culture]], living abroad in [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref name = &quot;azjarp&quot; /&gt; The following year she gave birth to their first son, [[Alexander Aris]], in London; their second son, Kim, was born in 1977. Subsequently, she earned a [[Ph.D.]] at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]] in 1985. She was elected an Honorary Fellow in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;azjarp&quot; /&gt; For two years she was a Fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies (IIAS) in [[Shimla]], [[India]].  She also worked for the [[Politics of Burma#AFPFL/Union Government|government of the Union of Burma]].

In 1988 Suu Kyi returned to [[Burma]], at first to tend for her ailing mother but later to lead the pro-[[democracy]] movement. Aris' visit in Christmas 1995 turned out to be the last time that he and Suu Kyi met, as Suu Kyi remained in Burma and the Burmese [[dictatorship]] denied him any further entry visas.&lt;ref name = &quot;azjarp&quot; /&gt; Aris was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in 1997 which was later found to be [[terminal illness|terminal]]. Despite appeals from prominent figures and organizations, including the United States, UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] and [[Pope John Paul II]], the Burmese government would not grant Aris a [[visa (document)|visa]], saying that they did not have the facilities to care for him, and instead urged Aung San Suu Kyi to leave the country to visit him. She was at that time temporarily free from [[house arrest]] but was unwilling to depart, fearing that she would be refused re-entry if she left, as she did not trust the [[military junta]]'s assurance that she could return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/304497.stm Suu Kyi rejects UK visit offer]. [[BBC News]]. 26 March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aris died on his 53rd birthday on 27 March 1999. Since 1989, when his wife was first placed under house arrest, he had seen her only five times, the last of which was for Christmas in 1995. She also remains separated from her children, who live in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/305487.stm|title=Obituary: A courageous and patient man  | publisher =BBC News|date =1999-03-27 | accessdate =2006-07-04 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2008, after [[Cyclone Nargis]] hit Burma, Suu Kyi lost the roof of her house and lived in virtual darkness after losing electricity in her dilapidated lakeside residence.

==Political beginnings==
Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma in 1988 to take care of her ailing mother. By coincidence, in the same year, the long-time military leader of Burma and head of the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party|ruling party]], General [[Ne Win]], stepped down. This led to mass demonstrations for democracy on 8 August 1988 (8-8-88, a day seen as auspicious), which were violently suppressed in what came to be known as the [[8888 Uprising]]. On 26 August 1988, she addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] in the capital, calling for a democratic government.&lt;ref name=&quot;azjarp&quot; /&gt; However in September, a [[State Peace and Development Council|new military junta]] took power. Later the same month, 24 September 1988, the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) was formed, with Suu Kyi as general secretary.

She was offered freedom if she left the country, but she refused.

One of her most famous speeches is the &quot;Freedom From Fear&quot; speech, which begins: &quot;It is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it.&quot;

She also believes fear spurs many world leaders to lose sight of their purpose. &quot;Government leaders are amazing&quot;, she once said. &quot;So often it seems they are the last to know what the people want.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Voice of Her People: Aung San Suu Kyi | publisher = Parade Magazine | date = Jan. 19, 1997 | url = http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/1997/edition_01-19-1997/aung-san-suu-kyi.html?index=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
===1990 General Election===
In 1990, the military junta called a [[Burmese general election, 1990|general election]], in which the National League for Democracy (NLD) received 59% of the votes, guaranteeing NLD 80% of the parliament seats. Some claim that Aung San Suu Kyi would have assumed the office of [[Prime Minister]]; in fact, however, she did not stand as a candidate in the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.amnestyusa.org/defenders/aungsansuukyi.asp |title=Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's Icon of Democracy, Hope and Grace Under Pressure}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the results were nullified, and the military refused to hand over power. This resulted in an international outcry. Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest at her home on University Avenue ({{Coord|16|49|32|N|96|9|1|E|region:MM_type:landmark}}) in Rangoon. During her arrest, she was awarded the [[Sakharov Prize]] for Freedom of Thought in 1990, and the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] the year after. Her sons [[Alexander Aris|Alexander]] and Kim accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf. Aung San Suu Kyi used the Nobel Peace Prize's 1.3 million [[USD]] prize money to establish a health and education trust for the Burmese people.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2001), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996 attack===
On 9 November 1996, the [[motorcade]] that she was traveling in with other [[National League for Democracy]] leaders [[Tin Oo]] and U Kyi Maung, was attacked in Rangoon.

About 200 men swooped on the motorcade, wielding metal chains, metal batons, stones and other weapons. The car that Aung San Suu Kyi was in had its rear window smashed, and the car with Tin Oo and U Kyi Maung had its rear window and two backdoor windows shattered. It is believed the offenders were members of the Union Solidarity Development Association (USDA) who were allegedly paid 500 kyats (USD $5) each to participate. The NLD lodged an official complaint with the police, and according to reports the government launched an investigation, but no action was taken.

===House arrest===
Aung San Suu Kyi has been placed under [[house arrest]] on numerous occasions since she began her political career, totalling 15 of the past 21 years.&lt;ref name=sk&gt;Moe, Wait (3 August 2009). [http://www.irrawaddy.org/highlight.php?art_id=16470 Suu Kyi Questions Burma’s Judiciary, Constitution]. ''[[The Irrawaddy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; During these periods, she had been prevented from meeting her party supporters and international visitors. In an interview, Suu Kyi said that while under house arrest she spent her time reading philosophy, politics and biographies that her husband had sent her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZFpURJGv00&amp;feature=related Aung San Suu Kyi interview (video)].

''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The media have also been prevented from visiting. In 1998, journalist [[Maurizio Giuliano]], after photographing her, was stopped by customs officials, and all his films, tapes and some notes were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/alerts/content/view/full/6725/ |title=Maurizio Giuliano denied entry to Burma after meetings with Aung San Suu Kyi}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suu Kyi met the leader of Burma, General [[Than Shwe]], accompanied by General [[Khin Nyunt]] on 20 September 1994, while under house arrest.  It was the first meeting since she had been placed in detention.&lt;ref name = &quot;azjarp&quot; /&gt; On several occasions during Suu Kyi's house arrest, she has had periods of poor health and as a result has been hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick |last=Wadhams|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060901000.html |title=Myanmar's Suu Kyi Hospitalized |agency=Associated Press |work=Washington Post |date=9 June 2006 |accessdate=2006-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her house arrest term came to an end on 13 November 2010.

===UN involvement===
The [[United Nations]] has attempted to facilitate dialogue between the [[military junta|junta]] and Suu Kyi.&lt;ref name=bc&gt;[http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/aboutburma/aung_san_suu_kyi.htm Biography Aung San Suu Kyi], Burma Campaign.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May 2002, following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the UN, the government released her; a government spokesman said that she was free to move &quot;because we are confident that we can trust each other&quot;. Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed &quot;a new dawn for the country&quot;. However on 30 May 2003, a government-sponsored mob attacked her caravan in the northern village of [[Depayin massacre|Depayin]], murdering and wounding many of her supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |title=The Depayin Massacre 2 Years On, Justice Denied |accessdate=2007-02-04 |date=30 May 2005 |format=PDF |publisher=ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Burma Caucus }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene with the help of her driver, Ko Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching Ye-U. The government imprisoned her at [[Insein Prison]] in Rangoon. After she underwent a [[hysterectomy]] in September 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3119038.stm | title =Suu Kyi has 'major' operation | publisher =BBC News | date =2003-09-19 | accessdate =2006-07-04 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government again placed her under house arrest in Rangoon.

The results from the UN facilitation have been mixed; [[Razali Ismail]], UN special envoy to Burma, met with Aung San Suu Kyi. Ismail resigned from his post the following year, partly because he was denied re-entry to Burma on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://english.dvb.no/news.php?id=6287 | title =Annan expresses sadness for the resignation of his envoy for Burma | publisher =Democratic Voice of Burma | date =2006-01-10 | accessdate =2006-07-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928172156/http://english.dvb.no/news.php?id=6287 |archivedate = September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later in 2006, [[Ibrahim Gambari]], [[United Nations|UN]] [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Undersecretary-General]] (USG) of [[United Nations Department of Political Affairs|Department of Political Affairs]], met with Aung San Suu Kyi, the first visit by a foreign official since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=20 May 2006 |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=18557&amp;Cr=Myanmar&amp;Cr1= |title=After meeting Aung San Suu Kyi, UN envoy leaves Burma|publisher=United Nations  |accessdate=2006-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also met with Suu Kyi later the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/International/2006/11/11/010-emissaire-suukyi.shtml |title=Rare visite |accessdate=2007-01-12 |date=8 January 2007 |work=Radio-Canada |publisher=Société Radio-Canada|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 2007 Gambari returned to talk to her again after seeing [[Than Shwe]] and other members of the senior leadership in [[Naypyidaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UN envoy meets with Burma's top general to discuss 'current situation' |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=24129 |publisher=UN News Service |date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[State television]] broadcast Suu Kyi with Gambari, stating that they had met twice.

The United Nations Working Group for Arbitrary Detention rendered an Opinion (No. 9 of 2004) that her deprivation of liberty was arbitrary, as being in contravention of Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] 1948, and requested that the authorities in Burma set her free, but the authorities had thus far ignored this request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrs/wgad/9-2004.html |title=Daw Aung San Suu Kyi v.

Such claims were rejected by Brig-General [[Khin Yi]], Chief of [[Myanmar Police Force]] (MPF). On 18 January 2007, the [[State media|state-run]] paper ''[[New Light of Myanmar]]'' accused Suu Kyi of [[tax evasion]] for spending her Nobel Prize money outside of the country. The accusation followed the defeat of a US-sponsored [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution condemning Burma as a threat to international security; the resolution was defeated because of strong opposition from [[China]], which has strong ties with the military junta (China later voted against the resolution, along with [[Russia]] and [[South Africa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/world/asia/19myanmar.html |title=Burmese Daily at Odds With Democracy Advocate |author=Mydans, Seth |accessdate=2007-01-19 |date=18 January 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, it was reported that Suu Kyi would meet her political allies [[National League for Democracy]] along with a government minister. The ruling junta made the official announcement on state TV and radio just hours after UN special envoy [[Ibrahim Gambari]] ended his second visit to Burma. The NLD confirmed that it had received the invitation to hold talks with Suu Kyi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7085292.stm |title=Suu Kyi to meet party colleagues|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2007-11-08|date=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the process delivered few concrete results.

On 3 July 2009, UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] went to Burma to pressure the junta into releasing Suu Kyi and to institute democratic reform. However, on departing from Burma, Ban Ki-moon said he was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the visit after junta leader [[Than Shwe]] refused permission for him to visit Suu Kyi, citing her ongoing trial. Ban said he was &quot;deeply disappointed that they have missed a very important opportunity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Heilprin|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/05/un-chief-leaves-myanmar-039disappointed039-with-junta.html |title=UN chief leaves Myanmar 'disappointed' with junta|publisher=[[The Jakarta Post]]|date=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the court accepted the argument that the 1974 constitution, under which she had been charged, was null and void, it also said the provisions of the 1975 security law, under which she has been kept under house arrest, remained in force.

Burma's relaxing stance, such as releasing political prisoners, was influenced in the wake of successful recent diplomatic visits by the US and other democratic governments, urging or encouraging the Burmese towards democratic reform. U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] personally advocated for the release of all political prisoners, especially Aung San Suu Kyi, during the US-[[ASEAN]] Summit of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_452398.html |title=Obama to appeal on Suu Kyi |publisher=Straitstimes.com |date=2009-11-10 |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abraham Joshua Heschel''' (January 11, 1907 – December 23, 1972) was a Polish-born American [[rabbi]] and one of the leading [[Jew]]ish theologians and Jewish philosophers of the 20th century.

==Biography==
Abraham Joshua Heschel was descended from preeminent European [[rabbi]]s on both sides of the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;wjc&quot;/&gt; His great-great-grandfather and namesake was [[Rebbe]]  [[Avraham Yehoshua Heshel]] of [[Opatów|Apt]]. His father, Moshe Mordechai Heschel, died of influenza in 1916. His mother Reizel Perlow was also a descendant of Avraham Yehoshua Heshel and other dynasties. He was the youngest of six children. His siblings were Sarah, Dvora Miriam, Esther Sima, Gittel, and Jacob. 

After a traditional  [[yeshiva]] education and studying for Orthodox rabbinical ordination [[semicha]], he pursued his doctorate at the [[University of Berlin]] and a liberal rabbinic ordination at the [[Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums]]. There he studied under some of the finest Jewish educators of the time: [[Hanoch Albeck|Chanoch Albeck]], [[Ismar Elbogen]], [[Julius Guttmann]], and [[Leo Baeck]]. Heschel later taught [[Talmud]] there. He joined a [[Yiddish]] poetry group, Jung Vilna, and in 1933, published a volume of Yiddish poems, ''Der Shem Hamefoyrosh: Mentsch,'' dedicated to his father.&lt;ref name = &quot;vzexea&quot;&gt;http://home.versatel.nl/heschel/Susannah.htm  Abraham Joshua Heschel&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 1938, when he was living in a rented room in the home of a Jewish family in [[Frankfurt]], he was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and deported to [[Poland]]. He spent ten months lecturing on Jewish [[philosophy]] and [[Torah]] at Warsaw's [[Institute for Jewish Studies]].&lt;ref name = &quot;vzexea&quot;/&gt; Six weeks before the German invasion of Poland, Heschel left Warsaw for [[London]] with the help of [[Julian Morgenstern]], president of [[Hebrew Union College]], who had been working to obtain visas for Jewish scholars in Europe.&lt;ref name = &quot;vzexea&quot;/&gt;

Heschel's sister Esther was killed in a German bombing. His mother was murdered by the Nazis, and two other sisters, Gittel and Devorah, died in Nazi concentration camps. He never returned to [[Germany]], [[Austria]] or Poland. He once wrote, &quot;If I should go to Poland or Germany, every stone, every tree would remind me of contempt, hatred, murder, of children killed, of mothers burned alive, of human beings asphyxiated.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;vzexea&quot;/&gt;

Heschel arrived in [[New York City]] in March 1940.&lt;ref name = &quot;vzexea&quot;/&gt; He served on the faculty of [[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), the main seminary of [[Reform Judaism (North America)|Reform Judaism]], in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] for five years. In 1946, he took a position at the  [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTS), the main seminary of [[Conservative Judaism]], where he served as professor of [[Jewish ethics]] and [[Kabbalah|Mysticism]] until his death in 1972.

Heschel married Sylvia Straus, a concert pianist, on December 10, 1946, in [[Los Angeles]]. Their daughter, [[Susannah Heschel]], is a Jewish scholar in her own right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20071122 Interview with Susannah Heschel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
Heschel explicated many facets of Jewish thought including studies on medieval Jewish [[philosophy]], [[Kabbalah]], and [[Hasidism]]. According to some scholars, he  was more interested in spirituality than in critical text study, which was a specialty of many scholars at JTS. He was not given a graduate assistant for many years and was relegated to teach mainly in the education school or Rabbinical school, not in the academic graduate program. Heschel was particularly spurned by his colleague [[Mordechai Kaplan]], founder of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], and many students who attended JTS in the 50s sympathized with Kaplan over Heschel.&lt;ref&gt;Scult, Mel .   Kaplan's Heschel :   a view from the Kaplan diary.   In: Conservative Judaism, 54,4 (2002) 3-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Heschel saw the teachings of the Hebrew prophets as a clarion call for social action in the United States and worked for black [[civil rights]] and against the [[Vietnam War]] &lt;ref name=&quot;wjc&quot;&gt;&quot;Dateline World Jewry&quot;, April 2007, [[World Jewish Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; Heschel was an activist for [[civil rights]] in the United States. 

He also specifically criticized what he called &quot;pan-halakhism&quot;, or an exclusive focus upon religiously-compatible behavior to the neglect of the non-legalistic dimension of rabbinic tradition.

===Influence outside of Judaism===
Heschel is among the few widely read Jewish theologians. His most influential works include ''Man is Not Alone, God in Search of Man, The Sabbath,'' and ''The Prophets''. At the [[Vatican Council II]], as representative of American Jews, Heschel persuaded the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to eliminate or modify passages in its liturgy that demeaned the Jews, or expected their conversion to Christianity. His theological works argued that religious experience is a fundamentally human impulse, not just a Jewish one, and that no religious community could claim a monopoly on religious truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gillman | first=Neil | title=Conservative Judaism: The New Century | year=1993 | publisher=Behrman House Inc. | pages = 163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published work==
===''The Prophets''===
This work started out as his Ph.D. thesis in German, which he later expanded and translated into English. Originally published in a two-volume edition, this work studies the books of the Hebrew prophets. It covers their lives and the historical context that their missions were set in, summarizes their work, and discusses their psychological state.  In it Heschel forwards what would become a central idea in his theology: that the prophetic (and, ultimately, Jewish) view of God is best understood not as anthropomorphic (that God takes human form) but rather as anthropopathic &amp;mdash; that God has human feelings.

===''The Sabbath''===
''The Sabbath: Its Meaning For Modern Man'' is a work on the nature and celebration of [[Shabbat]], the Jewish Sabbath. This work is rooted in the thesis that Judaism is a religion of time, not space, and that the Sabbath symbolizes the sanctification of time.

===''Man is Not Alone''===
''Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion'' offers Heschel's views on how people can comprehend God. Judaism views God as being radically different from humans, so Heschel explores the ways that Judaism teaches that a person may have an encounter with the ineffable. A recurring theme in this work is the radical amazement that people feel when experiencing the presence of the Divine. Heschel then goes on to explore the problems of doubts and faith; what Judaism means by teaching that God is one; the essence of humanity and the problem of human needs; the definition of religion in general and of Judaism in particular; and human yearning for spirituality. He offers his views as to Judaism being a pattern for life.

===''God in Search of Man''===
''God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism'' is a companion volume to ''Man is Not Alone''. In this book Heschel discusses the nature of religious thought, how thought becomes faith, and how faith creates responses in the believer. He discusses ways that people can seek God's presence, and the radical amazement that we receive in return. He offers a criticism of nature worship; a study of humanity's metaphysical loneliness, and his view that we can consider God to be in search of humanity. The first section concludes with a study of [[Jews as a chosen people]]. Section two deals with the idea of [[revelation]], and what it means for one to be a prophet. This section gives us his idea of revelation as an event, as opposed to a process. This relates to Israel's commitment to God.  Section three discusses his views of how a Jew should understand the nature of Judaism as a religion. He discusses and rejects the idea that mere faith (without law) alone is enough, but then cautions against rabbis he sees as adding too many restrictions to Jewish law. He discusses the need to correlate ritual observance with spirituality and love, the importance of [[Kavanah]] (intention) when performing [[mitzvot]]. He engages in a discussion of religious behaviorism &amp;mdash; when people strive for external compliance with the law, yet disregard the importance of inner devotion.

===''Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets''===
Heschel wrote a series of articles, originally in Hebrew, on the existence of prophecy in Judaism after the destruction of the Holy [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE. These essays were translated into English and published as ''Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets: Maimonides and Others'' by the American Judaica publisher [[Ktav]].

The publisher of this book states, &quot;The standard Jewish view is that prophecy ended with the ancient prophets, somewhere early in the Second Temple era. Heschel demonstrated that this view is not altogether accurate. Belief in the possibility of continued prophetic inspiration, and in its actual occurrence appear throughout much of the medieval period, and even in modern times. Heschel's work on prophetic inspiration in the Middle Ages originally appeared in two long Hebrew articles. In them he concentrated on the idea that prophetic inspiration was possible even in post-Talmudic times, and, indeed, had taken place at various times and in various schools, from the [[Geonim]] to [[Maimonides]] and beyond.&quot;

===''Torah min HaShamayim'' ===
Many consider Heschel's ''Torah min HaShamayim BeAspaklariya shel HaDorot'', (''Torah from Heaven in the light of the generations'') to be his masterwork.  The three volumes of this work are a study of classical rabbinic theology and [[aggadah]], as opposed to [[halakha]] (Jewish law.)  It explores the views of the rabbis in the [[Mishnah]], [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]] about the nature of [[Torah]], the revelation of God to mankind, prophecy, and the ways that Jews have used scriptural exegesis to expand and understand these core Jewish texts. In this work Heschel views the second century sages Rabbis [[Akiva ben Yosef]] and [[Ishmael ben Elisha]] as paradigms for the two dominant world-views in Jewish theology

Two Hebrew volumes were published during his lifetime by [[Soncino Press]], and the third Hebrew volume was published posthumously by JTS Press in the 1990s. An English translation of all three volumes, with notes, essays and appendices, was translated and edited by Rabbi [[Gordon Tucker]], entitled ''Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations''. In its own right it can be the subject of intense study and analysis, and provides insight into the relationship between God and Man beyond the world of Judaism and for all Monotheism.

==Quotations==
*&quot;Racism is man's gravest threat to man - the maximum hatred for a minimum reason.&quot;
*&quot;All it takes is one person… and another… and another… and another… to start a movement&quot;
*&quot;Wonder rather than doubt is the root of all knowledge.&quot;
*&quot;A religious man is a person who holds God and man in one thought at one time, at all times, who suffers harm done to others, whose greatest passion is compassion, whose greatest strength is love and defiance of despair.&quot;
*&quot; God is either of no importance, or of supreme importance.&quot;
*&quot;Just to be is a blessing. Just to live is holy.&quot;
*&quot;Self-respect is the fruit of discipline, the sense of dignity grows with the ability to say no to oneself.&quot;
*&quot;Life without commitment is not worth living.&quot;
*&quot;Above all, the prophets remind us of the moral state of a people: Few are guilty, but all are responsible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heschel, A.J., ''The Prophets'' (New York: Harper Collins, 1962), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;Remember that there is a meaning beyond absurdity. Be sure that every little deed counts, that every word has power. Never forget that you can still do your share to redeem the world in spite of all absurdities and frustrations and disappointments.&quot;
*&quot;When I was young, I admired clever people. Now that I am old, I admire kind people.&quot;
*&quot;Awareness of symbolic meaning is awareness of a specific idea; ''kavanah'' is awareness of an ineffable situation.
*&quot;A Jew is asked to take a leap of action rather than a leap of thought.&quot;
*&quot;Speech has power. Words do not fade. What starts out as a sound, ends in a deed.&quot;
*&quot;The Almighty has not created the universe that we may have opportunities to satisfy our greed, envy and ambition.&quot;
*&quot;The higher goal of spiritual living is not to amass a wealth of information, but to face sacred moments.&quot;
*&quot;The course of life is unpredictable... no one can write his autobiography in advance.&quot;
*&quot;When I marched in [[Selma March|Selma]], my legs were praying.&quot;

==Commemoration==
[[File:Heschel brand small.png|thumb|200px|Logo of Heschel schools]]
Four schools have been named for Heschel, in the [[Upper West Side]] of New York City,  [[Northridge, California]], [[Agoura Hills, California]], and Toronto. In 2009, a highway in Missouri was named &quot;Dr. Abraham Joshua Heschel Highway&quot; after a [[Springfield, Missouri]] area [[Neo-Nazi]] group cleaned the stretch of highway as part of an &quot;Adopt-A-Highway&quot; plan.  Heschel's daughter, Susannah, has objected to the adoption of her father's name in this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/us/23heschel.html?ref=us | work=The New York Times | title=Daughter Against Use of Father’s Name to Subvert Neo-Nazis | first=Michael | last=Cooper | date=June 23, 2009 | accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Aberdeen Bestiary''''' ([[Aberdeen University]] Library, Univ. Lib. MS 24) is a 12th century English [[illuminated manuscript]] [[bestiary]] that was first listed in 1542 in the inventory of the [[Old Royal Library]] at the [[Palace of Westminster]]. 

Information about its origins and patron are circumstantial. It probably comes from the 12th century and was owned by an ecclesiastical patron of the north or south province. The ''Aberdeen Bestiary'' is related to other [[bestiary|bestiaries]] of the [[Middle Ages]] and especially the ''[[Ashmole Bestiary]]''. Some argue that the ''Aberdeen Bestiary'' might be the older of the two.{{Who|date=July 2010}}

The '''Asociación Latinoamericana de Integración''' (the '''Latin American Integration Association'''; known as '''ALADI''' or, occasionally, by the English acronym '''LAIA''') is a [[Latin America]]n trade integration association, based in [[Montevideo]]. Its main objective is the establishment of a common market, in pursuit of the economic and social development of the region. Signed on August 12, 1980, the Montevideo Treaty&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sice.oas.org/trade/Montev_tr/indexe.asp 1980 Treaty of Montevideo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtradelaw.net/fta/agreements/laiafta.pdf LAIA Free Trade Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt; is an international legal framework that establishes and governs the Latin American Integration Association. It sets the following general guidelines regarding trade relations between signatory countries: pluralism, convergence, flexibility, differential treatment and multiplicity.

==History==
The '''Latin American Free Trade Association''' (LAFTA) was created in the 1960 Treaty of Montevideo by [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], and [[Uruguay]]. The signatories hoped to create a common market in Latin America and offered tariff rebates among member nations. LAFTA came into effect on January 2, 1962. When the trade association began, it had seven members and its main goal was to eliminate all duties and restrictions on the majority of their trade within 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitter, Phillip C. &quot;Mexico and Latin American Economic Integration&quot;. California: Institute of International Studies, 1964. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1960s, the area of LAFTA had a population of 220 million and produced about $90 billion of goods and services annually. It also had an average per capita [[gross national product]] of $440.&lt;ref&gt;Yudelman, Montague. &quot;Agricultural Development and Economic Integration in Latin America&quot;. London: Inter-American Development Bank, 1969. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the LAFTA is the creation of a [[free trade]] zone in Latin America. It should foster mutual regional trade among the member states, as well as with the [[United States of America|US]] and the [[European Union]]. To achieve these goals, several institutions are foreseen:
* the council of foreign ministers
* a conference of all participating countries
* a permanent council

The LAFTA agreement had important limitations: it only refers to goods, not to services, and it does not include a coordination of policies. Compared to the European Union, the political and economic integration was very limited.

By 1970, LAFTA expanded to include four more [[Latin American]] nations: [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Venezuela]]. It now consisted of 11 nations. In 1980, LAFTA reorganized into the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). LAFTA brought many new positive changes to Latin America. With LAFTA in place existing productive capacity could be used more fully to supply regional needs,  industries could reduce costs as a result of potential economies through expanded output and regional specialization, and attraction to new investment occurred as a result of the regional market area.&lt;ref&gt;Mathis, Ferdinand John. &quot;Economic Integration in Latin America&quot;. Austin: Bureau of Business Research,  1969. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although LAFTA has brought many constructive results, it has also brought problems to individual nations and to Latin America as a whole. Some of the problems which individual countries face are the way they are grouped together by their economic strengths according to LAFTA. The grouping was originally Argentina, Brazil, and Chile in one group, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela in the second group, and the last group which included Bolivia, Ecuador, and Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;Mathis, Ferdinand John. &quot;Economic Integration in Latin America&quot;. Austin: Bureau of Business Research,  1969. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a problem in this classification because it ignores the great economic and other differences between the countries. Problems which Latin America faced as a whole had to do with many of the nations in the continent being underdeveloped. The Free Trade Agreement was seen as a way of the countries having greater economic interactions among each-other and thus improving the economic state of the poorer nations.

==Entry==
Any Latin-American country can join the 1980 Montevideo Treaty. [[Cuba]] was the last to accede, becoming a full member on August 26, 1999. In addition, ALADI is also open to all Latin American countries through agreements with other countries and integration areas of the continent, as well as to other developing countries or their respective integration areas outside Latin America. ALADI is now the largest Latin-American group of integration. It is responsible for regulations on foreign trade which includes regulations on technical measures, sanitary regulations, environment protection measures, quality control measures, automatic licensing measures, price control measures, monopolistic measures, as well as other measures. These regulations are put into place in order for trade to be even handed amongst members of ALADI.

==Methods==
The ALADI promotes the creation of an area of economic preferences in the region, aiming at a Latin American common market, through three mechanisms:
* Regional tariff preference granted to products originating in the member countries, based on the tariffs in force for third countries
* Regional scope agreement, among member countries
* Partial scope agreements, between two or more countries of the area

Either regional or partial scope agreements may cover tariff relief and trade promotion; economic complementation; agricultural trade; financial, fiscal, customs and health cooperation; environmental conservation; scientific and technological cooperation; tourism promotion; technical standards and many other fields. As the Montevideo Treaty is a &quot;framework treaty&quot;, by subscribing to it, the governments of the member countries authorize their representatives to legislate through agreements on the economic issues of greatest importance to each country.

A system of preferences &amp;mdash; which consists of market opening lists, special cooperation programs (business rounds, preinvestment, financing, technological support) and countervailing measures on behalf of the landlocked countries &amp;mdash; has been granted to the countries deemed to be less developed (Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay), to favour their full participation in the integration process. As the institutional and normative &quot;umbrella&quot; of regional integration that shelters these agreements as well as the subregional ones ([[Andean Community]], [[MERCOSUR]], [[G-3 Free Trade Agreement]], [[Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas]], etc.) the Association aims to support every effort to create a common economic area.

'''Aircraft spotting'''  or '''plane spotting''' is the observation and logging of the [[aircraft registration|registration numbers]] of [[aircraft]]: [[Glider aircraft|glider]]s, powered aircraft, balloons, [[airship]]s, [[helicopter]]s, and [[microlight]]s.

When spotting aircraft, observers notice the key attributes of an aircraft.  They may notice a distinctive noise from its engine or the number of vapour trails it is leaving.  They will assess the size of the aircraft and the number, type and position of its engines.  Another clue &lt;!-- to what? --&gt; is the position of wings relative to the fuselage and the degree to which they are swept rearwards.  Are the wings above the fuselage, below it, or fixed at midpoint?  Perhaps it is a monoplane, [[biplane]], or triplane.  The position of the tailplane relative to the fin(s) and the shape of the fin are also clues to its type.  If it is an antique or light aircraft it might have a tail wheel.  Some aircraft types have a fixed [[undercarriage]] while others have retractable wheels. 

Other features include the speed, cockpit placement, colour scheme or special equipment that changes the silhouette of the aircraft.  Taken together these clues will enable the identification of an aircraft.  If the observer is familiar with the airfield being used by the aircraft and its normal traffic patterns, he or she is more likely to leap quickly to a decision about the aircraft's identity - they may have seen the same type of aircraft from the same angle many times.

Due to technical development, more and more spotters are using equipment like [[Radar|radar]] decoders to track the movements of aircraft. The two most famous devices used are called AirNav Radar and SBS Box. Both of them are reading and processing the radar data and show the movements on a computer screen. Most of the decoders also allow to export logs from a certain route or airport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD4vEE0uYR0&amp;t=1m59s &quot;Plane Spotters at Dublin Airport&quot;] ''Austrian Aviation Net'', 30 April 2011. Retrieved: 2 Mai 2011. The video shows a spotter who is observing the movements at Dublin Airport, including a screenshot of a SBS Box&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spotting styles==

Some spotters will note and compile the markings, a [[Military aircraft insignia|national insignia]] or [[airline]] livery or logo perhaps, a squadron badge or code letters in the case of a military aircraft.  Published manuals allow more information to be deduced, such as the delivery date or the manufacturer's construction number.  [[Camouflage]] markings differ, depending on the surroundings in which that aircraft is expected to operate.

Ancillary activities might include listening-in to air traffic transmissions (using [[radio scanner]]s, where that is legal), liaising with other &quot;spotters&quot; to clear up uncertainties as to what aircraft have been seen at specific times or in particular places. 

The hobbyist might travel long distances to visit a different airport from their usual one, to see an unusual aircraft or to view the remains of aircraft withdrawn from use.  Some aircraft may be placed in the care of museums (see [[Aviation archaeology]]) - or perhaps be cannibalised in order to repair a similar aircraft already preserved. 

Some spotters are competitive and may try to see all the aircraft of a particular operator, military or civil.  Aircraft registrations can be found in books, with online resources or in monthly magazines from enthusiast groups.

==During hostilities==
During [[World War II]] and the subsequent [[Cold War]] some countries encouraged their citizens to become &quot;plane spotters&quot; in an &quot;observation corps&quot; or similar public body for reasons of public security.  Britain had the [[Royal Observer Corps]] which operated between 1925 and 1995.  A journal called The Aeroplane Spotter was published in January 1940.  The publication included a glossary that was refined in 2010 and published online (see http://www.aeroplanemonthly.co.uk/glossary/)

==Air shows==
[[Air show]]s usually draw large numbers of spotters as it is a chance to enter [[airfield]]s and [[Air Force Base]]s worldwide that are usually closed to the public and to see displayed aircraft at close range. The most popular event in [[Europe]] is the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Legal ramifications==
[[Image:thunderbolt.a10.fairford.arp.jpg|thumb|right|The high engine position on this [[USAF]] [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] makes identification easy]]
The legal repercussions of the hobby were dramatically shown in November 2001 when fourteen aircraft spotters (twelve British, two Dutch) were arrested by Greek police after being observed at an open day at the [[Greek Air Force]] base at Kalamata. They were charged with espionage, and faced a possible 20-year prison sentence if found guilty. After being held for six weeks, they were eventually released on £9,000 bail, and the charges reduced to the misdemeanour charge of illegal information collection. Confident of their innocence they returned for their trial in April 2002 and were stunned to be found guilty, with eight of the group sentenced to three years, the rest for one year. At their appeal a year later all were acquitted .&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1950198.stm &quot;Plane-spotters 'ignored warnings'.&quot;] ''BBC News'', 25 April 2002. Retrieved: 14 March 2007. Quote: &quot;Note-taking in conjunction with other activities may be detrimental (to Greek security).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1953132.stm &quot;Greek court convicts plane-spotters.&quot;] ''BBC News'', 26 April 2002.

Quote: &quot;The verdict bears no relation whatsoever to the evidence given.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1953654.stm &quot;How did plane-spotters end up as spies?&quot;] ''BBC News'', 26 April 2002. Retrieved: 14 March 2007. Quote: &quot;I would warn that spotting in Greece is still not particularly liked by the authorities and without our contacts at the Greek Ministry of Defence, which helped on a number of occasions, the trip might have been a little longer than anticipated!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fight against terrorism==
In the wake of the targeting of airports by terrorists, enthusiasts' organisations and the police in the UK have co-operated in drawing up a code of conduct. This attempts to allow enthusiasts to continue their hobby and to increase security around airports, by asking enthusiasts to contact police if they believe something they see or hear is suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3682329.stm &quot;Plane-spotters join terror fight.&quot;] [[bbc.co.uk]], 4 May 2004 Retrieved: 16 September 2007. Quote: &quot;Police and BAA are recruiting aviation enthusiasts to help fight terrorism at London's Heathrow Airport.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraordinary rendition==
Following the events of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] information collected by planespotters helped uncover what is known as ''[[extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]]'' by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].  Information on unusual movements of [[rendition aircraft]] provided data which led first to news reports and then to a number of governmental and inter-governmental investigations.&lt;ref&gt;''Torture Taxi'', Trevor Paglen and A.C.Thompson, Icon Books, UK 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marketing}}

'''Advertising''' is a form of [[communication]] used to [[persuade]] an audience (viewers, readers or listeners) to take some action with respect to products, ideas, or services. Most commonly, the desired result is to drive consumer behavior with respect to a commercial offering, although political and ideological advertising is also common.  Advertising messages are usually paid for by sponsors and viewed via various media; including [[traditional media]] such as newspapers, magazines, television, radio, outdoor or direct mail; or [[new media]] such as websites and text messages. 

Commercial advertisers often seek to generate increased [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of their [[product (business)|product]]s or [[service (economics)|service]]s through &quot;branding,&quot; which involves the repetition of an image or product name in an effort to associate certain qualities with the brand in the minds of [[consumers]]. Non-commercial advertisers who spend money to advertise items other than a consumer product or service include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies. [[Nonprofit organizations]] may rely on free modes of persuasion, such as a [[public service announcement]].

Modern advertising developed with the rise of [[mass production]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
In 2010, spending on advertising was estimated at more than $300 billion in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tns-mi.com/news/01082007.htm |title=TNS Media Intelligence |publisher=Tns-mi.com |date=2007-01-08 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $500 billion worldwide{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.

Internationally, the largest (&quot;big four&quot;) advertising conglomerates are [[Interpublic]], [[Omnicom]], [[Publicis]], and [[WPP Group|WPP]].

==History==
[[File:Edo period advertising in Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Edo period]] advertising flyer from 1806 for a traditional medicine called ''Kinseitan'']]
Egyptians used [[papyrus]] to make sales messages and wall posters. [[Advertising campaign|Commercial messages]] and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] and ancient [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. [[Lost and found]] advertising on papyrus was common in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian [[rock art]] paintings that date back to 4000 BC.&lt;ref name= Bhatia&gt;Bhatia (2000). ''Advertising in Rural India: Language, Marketing Communication, and Consumerism'', 62+68&lt;/ref&gt; History tells us that [[Out-of-home advertising]] and [[billboards]] are the oldest forms of advertising.

As the towns and cities of the [[Middle Ages]] began to grow, and the general populace was unable to read, signs that today would say cobbler, miller, tailor or blacksmith would use an image associated with their trade such as a boot, a suit, a hat, a clock, a diamond, a horse shoe, a candle or even a bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers ([[town crier]]s) to announce their whereabouts for the convenience of the customers.

As education became an apparent need and reading, as well as printing, developed advertising expanded to include handbills. In the 17th century advertisements started to appear in weekly newspapers in England. These early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the [[printing press]]; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after as disease ravaged Europe. However, [[false advertising]] and so-called &quot;[[Quackery|quack]]&quot; advertisements became a problem, which ushered in the regulation of advertising content.

As the economy expanded during the 19th century, advertising grew alongside. In the United States, the success of this advertising format eventually led to the growth of mail-order advertising.

In June 1836, French newspaper ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'' was the first to include paid advertising in its pages, allowing it to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] and the formula was soon copied by all titles. Around 1840, [[Volney B. Palmer]] established the roots of the modern day advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad- the copy, layout, and artwork- was stilled prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation  changed in the late 19th century when the advertising agency of N.W. Ayer &amp; Son was founded. Ayer and Son offered to plan, create, and execute complete advertising campaigns for its customers. By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.

At first, agencies were brokers for advertisement space in newspapers. &lt;!-- INSERT ADVERTISING AGENCIES' ROLES AFTER THEY OUTGREW BEING LIMITED TO BEING BROKERS for ADVERTISEMENT SPACE IN NEWSPAPERS --&gt; [[N.

At the turn of the century, there were few career choices for women in business; however, advertising was one of the few. Since women were responsible for most of the purchasing done in their [[household]], advertisers and agencies recognized the value of women's insight during the [[Creativity|creative process]]. In fact, the first American advertising to use a [[Sex in advertising|sexual sell]] was created by a woman – for a soap product. Although tame by today's standards, the advertisement featured a couple with the message &quot;The skin you love to touch&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvacres.com/adslogans_w.htm Advertising Slogans], [[Woodbury Soap Company]], &quot;The skin you love to touch&quot;, [[JWT|J.

In the early 1920s, the first radio stations were established by radio equipment manufacturers and retailers who offered programs in order to sell more radios to consumers. As time passed, many non-profit organizations followed suit in setting up their own radio stations, and included: schools, clubs and civic groups.&lt;ref name = &quot;uouynv&quot;&gt;[[Robert W. McChesney|McChesney, Robert]], ''Educators and the Battle for Control of U.S. Broadcasting, 1928-35'', Rich Media, Poor Democracy, ISBN 0-252-02448-6 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; When the practice of [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsoring]] programs was popularised, each individual radio program was usually sponsored by a single business in exchange for a brief mention of the business' name at the beginning and end of the sponsored shows. However, radio station owners soon realised they could earn more money by selling sponsorship rights in small time allocations to multiple businesses throughout their radio station's broadcasts, rather than selling the sponsorship rights to single businesses per show.

[[File:Ad Encyclopaedia-Britannica 05-1913.jpg|thumb|left|A print advertisement for the 1913 issue of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'']]

This practice was carried over to television in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
&lt;!-- INSERT TIME PERIOD --&gt;
A fierce battle was fought between those seeking to commercialise the radio and people who argued that the radio spectrum should be considered a part of the commons – to be used only non-commercially and for the public good. The United Kingdom pursued a public funding model for the BBC, originally a private company, the [[British Broadcasting Company]], but incorporated as a public body by [[Royal Charter]] in 1927. In Canada, advocates like [[Graham Spry]] were likewise able to persuade the federal government to adopt a public funding model, creating the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]. However, in the United States, the capitalist model prevailed with the passage of the [[Communications Act of 1934]] which created the [[Federal Communications Commission]].&lt;ref name = &quot;uouynv&quot;/&gt; However, the U.S. Congress did require commercial broadcasters to operate in the &quot;public interest, convenience, and necessity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/P/htmlP/publicintere/publicintere.htm |title=Public Interest, Convenience and Necessity |publisher=Museum.tv |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public broadcasting]] now exists in the United States due to the 1967 [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967|Public Broadcasting Act]] which led to the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] and [[National Public Radio]].

In the early 1950s, the [[DuMont Television Network]] began the modern practice of selling advertisement time to multiple sponsors. Previously, DuMont had trouble finding sponsors for many of their programs and compensated by selling smaller blocks of advertising time to several businesses. This eventually became the standard for the commercial television industry in the United States. However, it was still a common practice to have single sponsor shows, such as [[The United States Steel Hour]]. In some instances the sponsors exercised great control over the content of the show—up to and including having one's advertising agency actually writing the show. The single sponsor model is much less prevalent now, a notable exception being the [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]].

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of [[cable television]] and particularly [[MTV]]. Pioneering the concept of the [[music video]], MTV ushered in a new type of advertising: the consumer tunes in ''for'' the advertising message, rather than it being a [[by-product]] or afterthought. As cable and [[satellite television]] became increasingly prevalent, [[specialty channel]]s emerged, including channels entirely [[Shopping channel|devoted to advertising]], such as [[QVC]], [[Home Shopping Network]], and [[ShopTV Canada]].

Marketing through the Internet opened new frontiers for advertisers and contributed to the &quot;[[dot-com bubble|dot-com]]&quot; boom of the 1990s. Entire corporations operated solely on advertising revenue, offering everything from [[coupon]]s to free Internet access. At the turn of the 21st century, a number of websites including the [[Web search engine|search engine]] [[Google]], started a change in [[online advertising]] by emphasizing contextually relevant, unobtrusive ads intended to help, rather than inundate, users. This has led to a plethora of similar efforts and an increasing trend of [[interactive advertising]].

The share of advertising spending relative to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] has changed little across large changes in [[Mass media|media]]. For example, in the US in 1925, the main advertising media were newspapers, magazines, signs on [[Tram|streetcars]], and outdoor [[poster]]s. Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998, television and radio had become major advertising media. Nonetheless, advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lower—about 2.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm |title=Annual U.S. Advertising Expenditure Since 1919 |publisher=Galbithink.org |date=2008-09-14 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent advertising innovation is &quot;[[guerrilla marketing]]&quot;, which involve unusual approaches such as staged encounters in public places, giveaways of products such as cars that are covered with brand messages, and interactive advertising where the viewer can respond to become part of the advertising message.Guerrilla advertising is becoming increasing more popular with a lot of companies. This type of advertising is unpredictable and innovative, which causes consumers to buy the product or idea. This reflects an increasing trend of interactive and &quot;embedded&quot; ads, such as via [[product placement]], having consumers vote through [[Text messaging|text messages]], and various innovations utilizing [[social network service]]s such as [[Facebook]].

===Public service advertising===
The advertising techniques used to promote commercial goods and services can be used to inform, educate and motivate the public about non-commercial issues, such as HIV/AIDS, political ideology, energy conservation and deforestation.

Advertising, in its non-commercial guise, is a powerful educational tool capable of reaching and motivating large audiences. &quot;Advertising justifies its existence when used in the public interest—it is much too powerful a tool to use solely for commercial purposes.&quot;  Attributed to [[Howard Gossage]] by [[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]].

[[Public service advertising]], [[non-commercial advertising]], public interest advertising, [[cause marketing]], and [[social marketing]] are different terms for (or aspects of) the use of sophisticated advertising and marketing communications techniques (generally associated with commercial enterprise) on behalf of non-commercial, public interest issues and initiatives.

In the United States, the granting of television and radio licenses by the FCC is contingent upon the station broadcasting a certain amount of public service advertising. To meet these requirements, many broadcast stations in America air the bulk of their required [[public service announcement]]s during the late night or early morning when the smallest percentage of viewers are watching, leaving more day and prime time commercial slots available for high-paying advertisers.

Public service advertising reached its height during [[World War I|World Wars I]] and [[World War II|II]] under the direction of more than one government. During WWII President Roosevelt commissioned the creation of The War Advertising Council (now known as the [[Ad Council]]) which is the nation's largest developer of PSA campaigns on behalf of government agencies and non-profit organizations, including the longest-running PSA campaign, [[Smokey Bear]].

==Marketing mix==
{{Main|Marketing mix}}
The marketing mix has been the key concept to advertising.  The marketing mix was suggested by professor [[E. Jerome McCarthy]] in the 1960s.  The marketing mix consists of four basic elements called the four P’s.
Product is the first P representing the actual product. Price represents the process of determining the value of a product.  Place represents the variables of getting the product to the consumer like distribution channels, market coverage and movement organization. The last P stands for Promotion which is the process of reaching the target market and convincing them to go out and buy the product.

==Advertising theory==
*Hierarchy of effects model&lt;ref&gt;Clow, Kenneth E.; Baack, Donald (2007). Integrated Advertising, Promotion, and Marketing Communications 3rd edition. Pearson Education. pp. 165-171. ISBN 0131866222.&lt;/ref&gt;
It clarifies the objectives of an advertising campaign and for each individual advertisement. The model suggests that there are six steps a consumer or a business buyer moves through when making a purchase. The steps are:
#Awareness
#Knowledge
#Liking
#Preference
#Conviction
#Purchase

*Means-End Theory
This approach suggests that an advertisement should contain a message or means that leads the consumer to a desired end state.

*Leverage Points
It is designed to move the consumer from understanding a product's benefits to linking those benefits with personal values.

*Verbal and Visual Images

==Types of advertising==
[[File:Advertisingman.jpg|thumb|Paying people to hold signs is one of the oldest forms of advertising, as with this [[Human billboard]] pictured above]]
[[File:Volvo B9TL SBS Transit SBS7357B.jpg|thumb|A bus with an advertisement for [[Gap (clothing retailer)|GAP]] in Singapore. Buses and other vehicles are popular mediums for advertisers.]]
[[File:101 016 DRI Ingolstadt.jpg|thumb|A [[DBAG Class 101]] with [[UNICEF]] ads at Ingolstadt main railway station]]

Virtually any medium can be used for advertising. Commercial advertising media can include [[Mural|wall paintings]], [[billboards]], [[street furniture]] components, printed flyers and [[rack card]]s, radio, cinema and television adverts, [[web banner]]s, mobile telephone screens, shopping carts, web [[Pop-up ad|popups]], [[skywriting]], bus stop benches, [[human billboard]]s, magazines, newspapers, town criers, sides of buses, banners attached to or sides of airplanes (&quot;[[logojet]]s&quot;), [[In-flight advertising|in-flight advertisements]] on [[Tray-table|seatback tray tables]] or overhead storage bins, taxicab doors, roof mounts and [[cabvision|passenger screens]], musical stage shows, subway platforms and trains, elastic bands on disposable diapers,doors of bathroom stalls,stickers on apples in supermarkets, [[Shopping cart|shopping cart handles]] (grabertising), the opening section of [[Streaming media|streaming]] audio and video, posters, and the backs of event tickets and supermarket receipts. Any place an &quot;identified&quot; sponsor pays to deliver their message through a medium is advertising.

===Digital advertising===
;[[Television advertisement|Television advertising]] / [[Music in advertising]]: The TV commercial is generally considered the most effective mass-market advertising format, as is reflected by the high prices TV networks charge for commercial [[Broadcasting|airtime]] during popular TV events. The annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football]] game in the United States is known as the most prominent advertising event on television. The average cost of a single thirty-second TV spot during this game has reached US$3 million (as of 2009). The majority of television commercials feature a song or [[jingle]] that listeners soon relate to the product. Virtual advertisements may be inserted into regular television programming through computer graphics. It is typically inserted into otherwise blank backdrops&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McCarthy |first=Michael |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2002-10-17-fake-ads_x.htm |title=Digitally inserted ads pop up more in sports |publisher=usatoday.Com |date=2002-10-17 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or used to replace local billboards that are not relevant to the remote broadcast audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Keith Mcarthur |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060315.RVIRTUAL15/TPStory/Business |title=Business |publisher=globeandmail.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; More controversially, virtual billboards may be inserted into the background&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canwestmediaworks.com/television/nontraditional/opportunities/virtual_advertising/ |title=Canwestmediaworks.com |publisher=Canwestmediaworks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; where none exist in real-life.

The word &quot;infomercial&quot; combining the words &quot;information&quot; &amp; &quot;commercial&quot;. The main objective in an infomercial is to create an [[impulse purchase]], so that the consumer sees the presentation and then immediately buys the product through the advertised [[toll-free telephone number]] or [[website]]. Infomercials describe, display, and often demonstrate products and their features, and commonly have testimonials from consumers and industry professionals.

;[[Radio advertisement|Radio advertising]]: '''Radio advertising''' is a form of advertising  via the medium of [[radio]]. Radio advertisements are broadcast as radio waves to the air from a transmitter to an antenna and a thus to a receiving device. Airtime is purchased from a [[radio station|station]] or [[radio network|network]] in exchange for airing the commercials. While radio has the limitation of being restricted to sound, proponents of radio advertising often cite this as an advantage. Radio is an expanding medium that can be found not only on air, but also online. According to Arbitron, radio has approximately 241.6 million weekly listeners, or more than 93 percent of the U.S. population.

;[[Online advertising]]: Online advertising is a form of [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] that uses the Internet and [[World Wide Web]] for the expressed purpose of delivering [[marketing]] messages to attract customers. Examples of online advertising include contextual ads that appear on [[search engine results page]]s, [[banner ad]]s, in [[Pay per click|text ads]], [[Rich Media]] Ads, [[Social network advertising]], [[online classified advertising]], [[advertising network]]s and [[e-mail marketing]], including [[e-mail spam]].

;Product placements: '''Covert advertising''', also known as guerrilla advertising, is when a product or brand is embedded in entertainment and media. For example, in a film, the main character can use an item or other of a definite brand, as in the movie ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', where [[Tom Cruise]]'s character John Anderton owns a phone with the ''[[Nokia]]'' logo clearly written in the top corner, or his watch engraved with the ''[[Bulgari]]'' logo. Another example of advertising in film is in ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', where main character played by [[Will Smith]] mentions his ''[[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]'' shoes several times, calling them &quot;classics,&quot; because the film is set far in the future. ''I, Robot'' and ''[[Spaceballs]]'' also showcase futuristic cars with the ''[[Audi]]'' and ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'' logos clearly displayed on the front of the vehicles. [[Cadillac]] chose to advertise in the movie ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', which as a result contained many scenes in which Cadillac cars were used. Similarly, product placement for [[Omega SA|Omega Watches]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[VAIO]], [[BMW]] and [[Aston Martin]] cars are featured in recent [[James Bond]] films, most notably ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. In &quot;[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]&quot;, the main transport vehicle shows a large [[Dodge]] logo on the front. ''[[Blade Runner]]'' includes some of the most obvious product placement; the whole film stops to show a [[Coca-Cola]] billboard.

===Physical advertising===
;Press advertising: Press advertising describes advertising in a printed medium such as a [[newspaper]], [[magazine]], or trade journal. This encompasses everything from media with a very broad readership base, such as a major national newspaper or magazine, to more narrowly targeted media such as local newspapers and trade journals on very specialized topics. A form of press advertising is [[classified advertising]], which allows private individuals or companies to purchase a small, narrowly targeted ad for a low fee advertising a product or service.  Another form of press advertising is the Display Ad, which is a larger ad (can include art) that typically run in an article section of a newspaper.

:Billboard advertising: [[Billboard]]s are large structures located in public places which display advertisements to passing pedestrians and motorists. Most often, they are located on main roads with a large amount of passing motor and pedestrian traffic; however, they can be placed in any location with large amounts of viewers, such as on mass transit vehicles and in stations, in shopping malls or office buildings, and in stadiums.

[[File:Redeye Sailboat.jpg|thumb|The ''[[RedEye]]'' newspaper advertised to its target market at [[North Avenue Beach]] with a sailboat billboard on [[Lake Michigan]].]]

;Mobile billboard advertising: [[Mobile billboard]]s are generally vehicle mounted [[billboard]]s or digital screens. These can be on dedicated vehicles built solely for carrying advertisements along routes preselected by clients, they can also be specially equipped cargo trucks or, in some cases, large banners strewn from planes. The billboards are often lighted; some being [[Backlight|backlit]], and others employing spotlights. Some billboard displays are static, while others change; for example, continuously or periodically rotating among a set of advertisements. Mobile displays are used for various situations in metropolitan areas throughout the world, including: Target advertising, One-day, and long-term campaigns, Conventions, Sporting events, Store openings and similar promotional events, and Big advertisements from smaller companies.

;In-store advertising: In-store advertising is any advertisement placed in a retail store. It includes placement of a product in visible locations in a store, such as at eye level, at the ends of aisles and near checkout counters, eye-catching displays promoting a specific product, and advertisements in such places as shopping carts and in-store video displays.

;Coffee cup advertising: Coffee cup advertising is any advertisement placed upon a coffee cup that is distributed out of an office, café, or drive-through coffee shop.  This form of advertising was first popularized in Australia, and has begun growing in popularity in the United States, India, and parts of the Middle East.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

;Street advertising: This type of advertising first came to prominence in the UK by Street Advertising Services to create outdoor advertising on street furniture and pavements. Working with products such as [[Reverse Graffiti]] and 3d pavement advertising, the media became an affordable and effective tool for getting brand messages out into public spaces.

;[[Celebrity branding]]: This type of advertising focuses upon using celebrity power, fame, money, popularity to gain recognition for their products and promote specific stores or products. Advertisers often advertise their products, for example, when celebrities share their favorite products or wear clothes by specific brands or designers. Celebrities are often involved in advertising campaigns such as television or print adverts to advertise specific or general products. The use of celebrities to endorse a brand can have its downsides, however. One mistake by a celebrity can be detrimental to the public relations of a brand. For example, following his performance of eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, swimmer Michael Phelps' contract with Kellogg's was terminated, as Kellogg's did not want to associate with him after he was photographed smoking marijuana.

==Sales promotions==
Sales promotions are another way to advertise.  Sales promotions are double purposed because they are used to gather information about what type of customers you draw in and where they are, and to jumpstart sales.  Sales promotions include things like contests and games, sweepstakes, product giveaways, samples coupons, loyalty programs, and discounts.  The ultimate goal of sales promotions is to stimulate potential customers to action.&lt;ref&gt;Altstiel, Tom, and Jean Grow. Advertising Strategy: Creative Tactics From the Outside/In. CA: Sage Publication Inc. 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media and advertising approaches==
Increasingly, other media are overtaking many of the &quot;traditional&quot; media such as television, radio and newspaper because of a shift toward consumer's usage of the Internet for news and music as well as devices like [[digital video recorders]] (DVRs) such as [[TiVo]].

Advertising on the [[World Wide Web]] is a recent phenomenon. Prices of Web-based advertising space are dependent on the &quot;relevance&quot; of the surrounding web content and the traffic that the website receives.

[[Digital signage]] is poised to become a major mass media because of its ability to reach larger audiences for less money.  Digital signage also offer the unique ability to see the [[target audience]] where they are reached by the medium.  Technological advances have also made it possible to control the message on digital signage with much precision, enabling the messages to be relevant to the target audience at any given time and location which in turn, gets more response from the advertising.  Digital signage is being successfully employed in supermarkets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aimdigitalvisions.com/content/weis-markets |title=Aimdigitalvisions.com |publisher=Aimdigitalvisions.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another successful use of digital signage is in hospitality locations such as restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aimdigitalvisions.com/content/shady-maple |title=Aimdigitalvisions.com |publisher=Aimdigitalvisions.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and malls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aimdigitalvisions.com/content/strawberry-square |title=Aimdigitalvisions.com |publisher=Aimdigitalvisions.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-mail advertising is another recent phenomenon. Unsolicited bulk E-mail advertising is known as &quot;[[e-mail spam]]&quot;.  Spam has been a problem for e-mail users for many years.

Some companies have proposed placing messages or corporate [[logo]]s on the side of booster [[rocket]]s and the [[International Space Station]]. Controversy exists on the effectiveness of [[subliminal message|subliminal advertising]] (see [[mind control]]), and the pervasiveness of mass messages (see [[propaganda]]).

Unpaid advertising (also called &quot;publicity advertising&quot;), can provide good exposure at minimal cost. Personal recommendations (&quot;bring a friend&quot;, &quot;sell it&quot;), spreading buzz, or achieving the feat of equating a brand with a common noun (in the United States, &quot;[[Xerox]]&quot; = &quot;[[photocopier]]&quot;, &quot;[[Kleenex]]&quot; = [[Facial tissue|tissue]], &quot;[[Vaseline]]&quot; = [[petroleum jelly]], &quot;[[The Hoover Company|Hoover]]&quot; = [[vacuum cleaner]], &quot;[[Nintendo]]&quot; (often used by those exposed to many video games) = [[video game]]s, and &quot;[[Band-Aid]]&quot; = [[adhesive bandage]]) — these can be seen as the pinnacle of any advertising campaign. However, some companies oppose the use of their brand name to label an object. Equating a brand with a common noun also risks turning that brand into a [[genericized trademark]] - turning it into a generic term which means that its legal protection as a [[trademark]] is lost.

As the mobile phone became a new mass media in 1998 when the first paid downloadable content appeared on mobile phones in Finland, it was only a matter of time until [[mobile advertising]] followed, also first launched in Finland in 2000. By 2007 the value of mobile advertising had reached $2.2 billion and providers such as [[Admob]] delivered billions of mobile ads.

More advanced mobile ads include banner ads, coupons, [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] picture and video messages, advergames and various [[engagement marketing]] campaigns. A particular feature driving mobile ads is the [[2D barcode|2D Barcode]], which replaces the need to do any typing of web addresses, and uses the camera feature of modern phones to gain immediate access to web content. 83 percent of Japanese mobile phone users already are active users of 2D barcodes.

A new form of advertising that is growing rapidly is [[social network advertising]]. It is online advertising with a focus on social networking sites. This is a relatively immature market, but it has shown a lot of promise as advertisers are able to take advantage of the demographic information the user has provided to the social networking site. Friendertising is a more precise advertising term in which people are able to direct advertisements toward others directly using [[social network service]].

From time to time, [[The CW Television Network]] airs short programming breaks called &quot;Content Wraps,&quot; to advertise one company's product during an entire commercial break. The CW pioneered &quot;content wraps&quot; and some products featured were [[Herbal Essences]], [[Crest (toothpaste)|Crest]], [[Guitar Hero II]], [[CoverGirl]], and recently [[Toyota]].

Recently, there appeared a new promotion concept, &quot;ARvertising&quot;, advertising on [[Augmented Reality]] technology.

==Current trends==
===Rise in new media===
With the dawn of the Internet came many new advertising opportunities. Popup, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[Web banner|banner]], Popunder, [[advergaming]], and email advertisements (the last often being a form of spam) are now commonplace. Particularly since the rise of &quot;entertaining&quot; advertising, some people may like an advertisement enough to wish to watch it later or show a friend. In general, the advertising community has not yet made this easy, although some have used the Internet to widely distribute their ads to anyone willing to see or hear them. In the last three quarters of 2009 mobile and internet advertising grew by 18.1% and 9.2% respectively. Older media advertising saw declines: −10.1% (TV), −11.7% (radio), −14.8% (magazines) and −18.7% (newspapers ).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Niche marketing===
Another significant trend regarding future of advertising is the growing importance of the [[niche market]] using niche or targeted ads. Also brought about by the Internet and the theory of [[The Long Tail]], advertisers will have an increasing ability to reach specific audiences. In the past, the most efficient way to deliver a message was to blanket the largest [[mass market]] audience possible. However, usage tracking, customer profiles and the growing popularity of niche content brought about by everything from [[blog]]s to social networking sites, provide advertisers with audiences that are smaller but much better defined, leading to ads that are more relevant to viewers and more effective for companies' marketing products. Among others, [[Comcast Spotlight]] is one such advertiser employing this method in their [[video on demand]] menus. These advertisements are targeted to a specific group and can be viewed by anyone wishing to find out more about a particular business or practice at any time, right from their home. This causes the viewer to become proactive and actually choose what advertisements they want to view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comcastspotlight.com/sites/Default.aspx?pageid=7608&amp;siteid=62&amp;subnav=3 &quot;Interactive - VOD&quot;] &quot;Comcast Spotlight website&quot;. Retrieved October 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowdsourcing===
{{main|Crowdsourcing}}
The concept of [[crowdsourcing]] has given way to the trend of [[user-generated]] advertisements. User-generated ads are created by consumers as opposed to an advertising agency or the company themselves, most often they are a result of brand sponsored advertising competitions. For the 2007 [[Super Bowl]], the Frito-Lays division of [[PepsiCo]] held the ''Crash the Super Bowl'' contest, allowing consumers to create their own [[Doritos]] commercial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Advertising Age&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |title=Who's Buying What at Super Bowl 2007|publisher=Advertising Age |accessdate=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chevrolet]] held a similar competition for their Tahoe line of SUVs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Advertising Age&quot;/&gt; Due to the success of the Doritos user-generated ads in the 2007 Super Bowl, Frito-Lays relaunched the competition for the 2009 and 2010 Super Bowl. The resulting ads were among the most-watched and most-liked Super Bowl ads. In fact, the winning ad that aired in the 2009 Super Bowl was ranked by the [[USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter]] as the top ad for the year while the winning ads that aired in the 2010 Super Bowl were found by Nielsen's BuzzMetrics to be the &quot;most buzzed-about&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |title=Do-It-Yourself Super Ads |publisher=New York Times |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=May 10, 2010|first=Stuart|last=Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |title='Two nobodies from nowhere' craft winning Super Bowl ad |publisher=USA Today |date=December 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2010|first=Bruce |last=Horovitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend has given rise to several online platforms that host [[user-generated]] advertising competitions on behalf of a company. Founded in 2007, [[Zooppa]] has launched ad competitions for brands such as [[Google]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Hershey’s]], [[General Mills]], [[Microsoft]], [[NBC Universal]], [[Zinio]], and [[Mini Cooper]]. Crowdsourced advertisements have gained popularity in part to its cost effective nature, high consumer engagement, and ability to generate word-of-mouth. However, it remains controversial, as the long-term impact on the advertising industry is still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/9521.asp |title=Are Consumer-Generated Ads Here to Stay? |publisher=iMediaConnection |date=May 10, 2006 |accessdate=May 10, 2010|first=Robert|last=Moskowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global advertising===

Advertising has gone through five major stages of development: domestic, export, international, multi-national, and global. For [[Global marketing|global advertisers]], there are four, potentially competing, business objectives that must be balanced when developing worldwide advertising: building a brand while speaking with one voice, developing economies of scale in the creative process, maximising local effectiveness of ads, and increasing the company’s speed of implementation. Born from the evolutionary stages of global marketing are the three primary and fundamentally different approaches to the development of global advertising executions: exporting executions, producing local executions, and importing ideas that travel.&lt;ref&gt;Global marketing Management, 2004, pp.13-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising research is key to determining the success of an ad in any country or region. The ability to identify which elements and/or moments of an ad that contributes to its success is how economies of scale&lt;!-- scale? --&gt; are maximised. Once one knows what works in an ad, that idea or ideas can be imported by any other market. [[Market research]] measures, such as [[Wikt:flow of attention|Flow of Attention]], [[Wikt:flow of emotion|Flow of Emotion]] and [[Wikt:branding moment|branding moments]] provide insight into what is working in an ad in any country or region because the measures are based on the visual, not verbal, elements of the ad.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign public messaging===

Foreign governments, particularly those that own marketable commercial products or services, often promote their interests and positions through the advertising of those goods because the target audience is not only largely unaware of the forum as vehicle for foreign messaging but also willing to receive the message while in a mental state of absorbing information from advertisements during television commercial breaks, while reading a periodical, or while passing by billboards in public spaces.  A prime example of this messaging technique is [[International Travel Advertising|advertising campaigns to promote international travel]].  While advertising foreign destinations and services may stem from the typical goal of increasing revenue by drawing more tourism, some travel campaigns carry the additional or alternative intended purpose of promoting good sentiments or improving existing ones among the target audience towards a given nation or region.  It is common for advertising promoting foreign countries to be produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads often carry political statements and/or depictions of the foreign government's [[Perception management|desired international public perception]].  Additionally, a wide range of foreign airlines and travel-related services which advertise separately from the destinations, themselves, are owned by their respective governments; examples include, though are not limited to, the [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates airline]] ([[Dubai]]), [[Singapore Airlines]] ([[Singapore]]), [[Qatar Airways]] ([[Qatar]]), [[China Airlines]] ([[Taiwan]]/[[Republic of China]]), and [[Air China]] ([[People's Republic of China]]).  By depicting their destinations, airlines, and other services in a favorable and pleasant light, countries market themselves to populations abroad in a manner that could mitigate prior public impressions.

===Diversification===
In the realm of [[advertising agencies]], continued industry diversification has seen observers note that “big global clients don't need big global agencies any more”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Howard |first=Theresa |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |title=USA Today, October 9, 2005 |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2005-10-10 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected by the growth of non-traditional agencies in various global markets, such as Canadian business [[TAXI (advertising agency)|TAXI]] and [[SMART (advertising agency)|SMART]] in Australia and has been referred to as &quot;a revolution in the ad world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New technology===
The ability to record shows on [[digital video recorder]]s (such as TiVo) allow users to record the programs for later viewing, enabling them to fast forward through commercials. Additionally, as more seasons of pre-recorded [[box set]]s are offered for sale of [[television program]]s; fewer people watch the shows on TV. However, the fact that these sets are '''sold''', means the company will receive additional profits from the sales of these sets. To counter this effect, many advertisers have opted for product placement on TV shows like [[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]].

===Advertising education===
[[Advertising education]] has become widely popular with bachelor, master and doctorate degrees becoming available in the emphasis. A surge in advertising interest is typically attributed to the strong relationship advertising plays in cultural and technological changes, such as the advance of online social networking. A unique model for teaching advertising is the [[student-run advertising agency]], where advertising students create campaigns for real companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Criticisms==
{{Main|Criticism of advertising}}
While advertising can be seen as necessary for economic growth, it is not without social costs. [[E-mail spam|Unsolicited commercial e-mail]] and other forms of [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] have become so prevalent as to have become a major nuisance to users of these services, as well as being a financial burden on [[internet service provider]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/03/1528247&amp;tid=111 |title=Slashdot &amp;#124; ISP Operator Barry Shein Answers Spam Questions |publisher=Interviews.slashdot.org |date=2003-03-03 |accessdate=20x09-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising is increasingly invading public spaces, such as schools, which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm |title=How Marketers Target Kids |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date=2009-02-13 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, advertising frequently uses psychological pressure (for example, appealing to feelings of inadequacy)  on the intended consumer, which may be harmful.

==Regulation==
{{Main|Advertising regulation}}

In the US many communities believe that many forms of outdoor advertising blight the public realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanblight.org/ |title=Welcome to SCRUB |publisher=Urbanblight.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long ago as the 1960s in the US there were attempts to ban billboard advertising in the open countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/beauty.htm |title=How the Highway Beautification Act Became a Law |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities such as [[São Paulo]] have introduced an outright ban&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/12/12/news/brazil.php |title=Billboard ban in São Paulo angers advertisers - Americas - International Herald Tribune |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; with London also having specific legislation to control unlawful displays.

There have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating the content and the influence of advertising. Some examples are: the ban on television tobacco advertising imposed in many countries, and the total ban of advertising to children under 12 imposed by the Swedish government in 1991. Though that regulation continues in effect for broadcasts originating within the country, it has been weakened by the [[European Court of Justice]], which had found that Sweden was obliged to accept foreign programming, including those from neighboring countries or via satellite. Greece’s regulations are of a similar nature, “banning advertisements for children's toys between 7 am and 10 pm and a total ban on advertisement for war toys&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/chidren/advertising_toys_eu.html |title=PPU.org.uk |publisher=PPU.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe and elsewhere, there is a vigorous debate on whether (or how much) advertising to children should be regulated. This debate was exacerbated by a report released by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] in February 2004 which suggested [[fast food advertising]] that targets children was an important factor in the epidemic of [[childhood obesity]] in the United States.

In New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, and many European countries, the advertising industry operates a system of self-regulation. Advertisers, advertising agencies and the media agree on a code of advertising standards that they attempt to uphold. The general aim of such codes is to ensure that any advertising is 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'. Some self-regulatory organizations are funded by the industry, but remain independent, with the intent of upholding the standards or codes like the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] in the UK.

In the UK most forms of outdoor advertising such as the display of billboards is regulated by the UK Town and County Planning system. Currently the display of an advertisement without consent from the Planning Authority is a criminal offense liable to a fine of £2,500 per offence. All of the major outdoor billboard companies in the UK have convictions of this nature.

Many advertisers employ a wide-variety of linguistic devices to bypass regulatory laws (e.g. printing English words in bold and French translations in fine print to deal with the Article 120 of the 1994 [[Toubon Law]] limiting the use of English in French advertising).&lt;ref&gt;Bhatia and Ritchie 2006:542&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisement of controversial products such as cigarettes and condoms are subject to government regulation in many countries. For instance, the tobacco industry is required by law in most countries to display warnings cautioning consumers about the health hazards of their products. Linguistic variation is often used by advertisers as a creative device to reduce the impact of such requirements.

==Advertising research==
{{Main|Advertising research}}
Advertising research is a specialized form of research that works to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising.  It entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologies.  Advertising research includes pre-testing (also known as [[copy testing]]) and post-testing of ads and/or campaigns—pre-testing is done before an ad airs to gauge how well it will perform and post-testing is done after an ad airs to determine the in-market impact of the ad or campaign on the consumer.  Continuous [[ad tracking]] and the [[Communicus]] System are competing examples of post-testing advertising research types.

==Semiotics==
{{Main|Advertising research}}
Today’s culture is made up of meanings between consumers and marketers.  These meanings depict [[signs]] and symbols that are encoded in everyday objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mick|first=Devid Glen|title=Consumer Reseach and Semiotics: Exploring the Morphology of Signs, Symbols, and Significance|journal=The Journal of Consumer Research|date=1986|month=September|volume=13|issue=2|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Semiotics]] is the study of signs and how they are interpreted.  Advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within [[brand names]], [[logos]], package designs, print [[advertisements]], and [[television advertisements]].  The purpose of [[semiotics]] is to study and interpret the message being conveyed in [[advertisements]]. [[Logos]] and [[advertisements]] can be interpreted at two levels known as the surface level and the underlying level.  The surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for their product.  These [[signs]] can be images, words, fonts, [[colors]], or slogan.  The underlying level is made up of hidden meanings.  The combination of images, words, [[colors]], and slogan must be interpreted by the audience or consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beasley|first=Ron|title=Persuasive Signs: The Semiotics of Advertising|year=2002|publisher=Walter deGruyter GmbH &amp; KG|location=Berlin, Germany|i  sbn=3-11-017341-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “key to advertising analysis” is the signifier and the signified.  The signifier is the object and the signified is the mental concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinson|first=Christian|title=Marketing Semiotics|year=1998|url=http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/inseadwp1998/98-39.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A product has a signifier and a signified.  The signifier is the [[color]], brand name, logo design, and technology.  The signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative.  The denotative meaning is the meaning of the product.  A television’s denotative meaning would be that it is high definition.  The connotative meaning is the product’s deep and hidden meaning.  A connotative meaning of a television would be that it is top of the line. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Umiker-Sebeok|first=Donna Jean|title=Marketing and Semiotics|year=1987|publisher=Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co.|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Apple is an excellent example of using [[semiotics]] in their [[advertising]] campaign.   Apple’s commercials used a black silhouette of a person that was the age of Apple's target market.  They placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing.  However, the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white iPod through white headphones.  Through [[advertising]], the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an iPod.  The white color signifies almost all of Apple’s products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salsburey|first=Justin|title=Semiotic analysis of iPod Advertisements|url=http://sites.google.com/site/jsalsburey/macintoshsemiotics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[semiotics]] of gender plays a key influence on the way in which signs are interpreted. When considering [[gender]] roles in advertising, individuals are influenced by three categories.  Certain characteristics of stumuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the [[message]] (if the product is perceived as [[feminine]] or [[masculine]]).  Second, the characteristics of individuals can affect [[attention]] and elaboration of the [[message]] ([[traditional]] or non-traditional [[gender-role]] orientation).  Lastly, situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the [[message]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ademola|first=Owolabi|title=Effects of Gender-Role Orientation, Sex of Advert Presenter and Product Type on Advertising Effectiveness|journal=European Journal of Scientific Research|year=2005|volume=35|issue=4|pages=537–543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are [[two]] types of [[marketing communication]] claims-objective and subjective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koc|first=Erdogan|title=Impact of gender in marketing communications: the role of cognitive and affective cues|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|year=2002|volume=8|issue=4|pages=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the brand with a tangible product or [[service]] feature.  For instance, the [[camera]] has auto focus features. Subjective claims convey emotional, subjective, impressions of intangible aspects of a product or [[service]].  They are non-physical features of a product or [[service]] that cannot be directly perceived, as they have no physical [[reality]].  For instance the [[brochure]] has a beautiful [[design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holbrook|first=Morris|title=Beyond Attitude Structure: Toward the Informational Determinants of Attitude|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|year=1978|month=November|volume=15|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Males]] tend to respond better to objective marketing communications claims while [[females]] tend to respond better to subjective [[marketing communications]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silverman|first=Julian|coauthors=King, Catherine|title=Pseudoperceptual defferentiation|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|year=1970|volume=34|issue=1|pages=119–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When advertising to different [[genders]] it is important to remember how men and women process [[information]].  [[Females]] process [[information]] comprehensively.  [[Males]] process [[information]] through heuristic devices such as [[procedures]], methods or [[strategies]] for solving [[problems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Statt|first=David|title=Understanding the Consumer - A Psychological Approach|year=1977|publisher=Macmillan Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Men prefer to have available and apparent cues to interpret the message where females engage in more creative, associative, imagery-laced interpretation.

In advertisements, men are represented as independent.  They are shown in more occupations than women.  Women are represented mainly as housewives and mothers.  Men are more likely to be shown [[advertising]] cars or business products, while women advertise domestic products.  Men are more likely to be shown outdoors or in business settings.  Women are depicted in domestic settings. Men are more often portrayed as authorities.  As far as ads go, with age men seem to gain wisdom and are depriced as an authority figure.  On the other hand women seem to disappear with age.  Voiceovers are commonly used in advertising.  Most [[voiceovers]] are men (figures of up to 94% have been reported).  There have been more [[female]] voiceovers in recent years but mainly for food, household products, and feminine care products. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chandler|first=Daniel|title=Television and Gender Roles|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Modules/TF33120/gendertv.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the field of [[artificial intelligence]], the most difficult problems are informally known as '''AI-complete''' or '''AI-hard''', implying that the difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to solving the central artificial intelligence problem—making computers as intelligent as people, or [[strong AI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro92&quot;&gt;Shapiro, Stuart C. (1992). [http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf Artificial Intelligence] In Stuart C. Shapiro (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence'' (Second Edition, pp.&amp;nbsp;54&amp;ndash;57). New York: John Wiley. (Section 4 is on &quot;AI-Complete Tasks&quot;.)&lt;/ref&gt;  To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple algorithm.  

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include [[computer vision]], [[natural language understanding]], and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem.

With current technology, AI-complete problems cannot be solved by computer alone, but also require [[human computation]].  This property can be useful, for instance to test for the presence of humans as with [[CAPTCHA]]s, and for [[computer security]] to circumvent [[brute-force attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas Hopper, and John Langford. [http://www.captcha.net/captcha_crypt.pdf CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security]. In Proceedings of Eurocrypt, Vol. 2656 (2003), pp. 294-311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bergmair.

(unpublished?)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was coined by [[Fanya Montalvo]] by analogy with [[NP-complete]] and [[NP-hard]] in [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], which formally describes the most famous class of difficult problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Mallery | first=John C.  |year=1988 | url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/mallery88thinking.html | contribution=Thinking About Foreign Policy: Finding an Appropriate Role for Artificially Intelligent Computers | title=The 1988 Annual Meeting of the International Studies Association. | location=St. Louis, MO }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early uses of the term are in Erik Mueller's 1987 Ph.D. dissertation&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Erik T. (1987, March). [ftp://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/tech-report/198_-reports/870017.pdf ''Daydreaming and Computation'' (Technical Report CSD-870017)] Ph.D. dissertation, University of California, Los Angeles. (&quot;Daydreaming is but one more ''AI-complete'' problem: if we could solve any one artificial intelligence problem, we could solve all the others&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;302)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Eric S. Raymond|Eric Raymond]]'s 1991 [[Jargon File]].&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Eric S. (1991, March 22). [http://catb.org/esr/jargon/oldversions/jarg282.txt Jargon File Version 2.8.1] (Definition of &quot;AI-complete&quot; first added to jargon file.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==AI-complete problems==
AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include:
*[[Computer vision]] (and subproblems such as [[object recognition]])
*[[Natural language understanding]] (and subproblems such as [[text mining]], [[machine translation]], and [[word sense disambiguation]])
*Dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem, whether it's [[robotic mapping|navigation]] or [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] or even the kind of [[reasoning]] done by [[expert system]]s.

===Machine translation===
{{main|machine translation}}

To translate accurately, a machine must be able to understand the text. It must be able to follow the author's argument, so it must have some ability to [[artificial intelligence#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]. It must have extensive [[commonsense knowledge|world knowledge]] so that it knows what is being discussed — it must at least be familiar with all the same commonsense facts that the average human translator knows. Some of this knowledge is in the form of facts that can be explicitly represented, but some knowledge is unconscious and closely tied to the human body: for example, the machine may need to understand how an ocean makes one ''feel'' to accurately translate a specific metaphor in the text. It must also model the authors' goals, intentions, and emotional states to accurately reproduce them in a new language. In short, the machine is required to have wide variety of human intellectual skills, including [[artificial intelligence#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]], [[commonsense knowledge]] and the intuitions that underlie [[robotics|motion and manipulation]], [[machine perception|perception]], and [[artificial intelligence#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]. [[Machine translation]], therefore, is believed to be AI-complete: it may require [[strong AI]] to be done as well as humans can do it.

==Software brittleness==
{{main|Software brittleness}}
AI systems can solve very simple restricted versions of AI-complete problems, but never in their full generality. When AI researchers attempt to &quot;scale up&quot; their systems to handle more complicated, real world situations, the programs tend to become excessively [[brittle (software)|brittle]] without [[commonsense knowledge]] or a rudimentary understanding of the situation: they fail as unexpected circumstances outside of its original problem context begin to appear.  When human beings are dealing with new situations in the world, they are helped immensely by the fact that they know what to expect: they know what all things around them are, why they are there, what they are likely to do and so on. They can recognize unusual situations and adjust accordingly. A machine without [[strong AI]] has no other skills to fall back on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lenat | first=Douglas |  last2=Guha | first2=R. V.| year = 1989 | title = Building Large Knowledge-Based Systems | publisher = Addison-Wesley| author-link=Douglas Lenat|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formalisation==
[[Computational complexity theory]] deals with the relative computational difficulty of [[computable function]]s.  By definition it does not cover problems whose solution are unknown or have not been characterised formally.  Since many AI problems have no formalisation yet, conventional complexity theory does not allow the definition of AI-completeness.

To address this problem, a complexity theory for AI has been proposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucl.ac.uk&quot;&gt;Dafna Shahaf and Eyal Amir (2007) [http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~eyal/papers/ai-complete-commonsense07.pdf Towards a theory of AI completeness]. [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/commonsense07 Commonsense 2007,  8th International Symposium on Logical Formalizations of Commonsense Reasoning].&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on a [[model of computation]] that splits the computational burden between a computer and a human: one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by human.  This is formalised by a '''human-assisted [[Turing machine]]'''.  The formalisation defines algorithm complexity, problem complexity and reducibility which in turn allows [[equivalence class]]es to be defined.

The complexity of executing an algorithm with a human-assisted Turing machine is given by a pair &lt;math&gt;\langle\Phi_{H},\Phi_{M}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where the first element represents the complexity of the human's part and the second element is the complexity of the machine's part.

===Results===
The complexity of solving the following problems with a human-assisted Turing machine is:&lt;ref name=&quot;ucl.ac.uk&quot;/&gt;

* [[Optical character recognition]] for printed text: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(1), poly(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Turing test]]:
** for an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sentence conversation where the oracle remembers the conversation history (persistent oracle): &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
** for an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sentence conversation where the conversation history must be retransmitted: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n^2) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
** for an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sentence conversation where the conversation history must be retransmitted and the person takes linear time to read the query&lt;math&gt;\langle O(n^2), O(n^2) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* [[ESP game]]: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* Image labelling (based on the [[Arthur–Merlin protocol]]): &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Object categorization from image search|Image classification]]: human only: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, and with less reliance on the human: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(\log n), O(n \log n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Archaeoastronomy''' (also spelled '''archeoastronomy''') is the study of how people in the past &quot;have understood the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] in the sky, how they used phenomena in the sky and what role the sky played in their [[culture]]s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair 2006:13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clive Ruggles]] argues it is misleading to consider archaeoastronomy to be the study of ancient [[astronomy]], as modern astronomy is a scientific discipline, while archaeoastronomy considers other cultures' symbolically rich cultural interpretations of phenomena in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 1999:155&lt;/ref&gt; It is often twinned with '''ethnoastronomy''', the [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of skywatching in contemporary societies. Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with [[historical astronomy]], the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the [[history of astronomy]], which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice.

Archaeoastronomy uses a variety of methods to uncover evidence of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, the problem of integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term issue for archaeoastronomers.&lt;ref&gt;Iwaniszewski 2003, 7-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in [[landscape archaeology]] and [[cognitive archaeology]]. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as [[Maya civilization#Astronomy|Mayan astronomy]] and its relationship with agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Chiu &amp; Morrison 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magli 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeoastronomy can be applied to all cultures and all time periods. The meanings of the sky vary from culture to culture; nevertheless there are scientific methods which can be applied across cultures when examining ancient beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;McCluskey 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It is perhaps the need to balance the social and scientific aspects of archaeoastronomy which led Clive Ruggles to describe it as: ''&quot;...[A] field with academic work of high quality at one end but uncontrolled speculation bordering on lunacy at the other.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Carlson 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of archaeoastronomy ==
{{quote|In his short history of 'Astro-archaeology' John Michell argued that the status of research into ancient astronomy had improved over the past two centuries, going 'from lunacy to heresy to interesting notion and finally to the gates of orthodoxy.' Nearly two decades later, we can still ask the question: Is archaeoastronomy still waiting at the gates of orthodoxy or has it gotten inside the gates?|Todd Bostwick quoting John Michell&lt;ref&gt;Bostwick 2006:13&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two hundred years before Michell wrote the above, there were no archaeoastronomers and there were [[Archaeology#History of archaeology|no professional archaeologists]], but there were astronomers and [[Antiquarianism|antiquarians]]. Some of their works are considered [[precursorial|precursors]] of archaeoastronomy; antiquarians interpreted the astronomical orientation of the ruins that dotted the English countryside as [[William Stukeley]] did of Stonehenge in 1740,&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 2001:9-10&lt;/ref&gt; while [[John Aubrey]] in 1678&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 1912:225&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henry Chauncy]] in 1700 sought similar astronomical principles underlying the orientation of churches.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin, 2001:7&lt;/ref&gt;  Late in the nineteenth century astronomers such as [[Richard Proctor]] and [[Charles Piazzi Smyth]] investigated the astronomical orientations of the pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 2001:17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''archaeoastronomy'' was first used by Elizabeth Chesley Baity (at the suggestion of Euan MacKie) in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair 2006:17&lt;/ref&gt; but as a topic of study it may be much older, depending on how archaeoastronomy is defined. Clive Ruggles&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:312-3&lt;/ref&gt; says that [[Heinrich Nissen]], working in the mid-nineteenth century was arguably the first archaeoastronomer. Rolf Sinclair&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair 2006:8&lt;/ref&gt; says that [[Norman Lockyer]], working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could be called the 'father of archaeoastronomy.' Euan MacKie&lt;ref&gt;Mackie 2006:243&lt;/ref&gt; would place the origin even later, stating: &quot;...the genesis and modern flowering of archaeoastronomy must surely lie in the work of [[Alexander Thom]] in Britain between the 1930s and the 1970s.

[[Image:Auglish.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Early archaeoastronomy surveyed Megalithic constructs in the British Isles, at sites like [[Auglish]] in [[County Londonderry]], in an attempt to find statistical patterns]].  In the 1960s the work of the engineer Alexander Thom and that of the astronomer [[Gerald Hawkins]], who proposed that [[Stonehenge]] was a [[Neolithic]] computer,&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins 1976&lt;/ref&gt; inspired new interest in the astronomical features of ancient sites. The claims of Hawkins were largely dismissed,&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson 1966&lt;/ref&gt; but this was not the case for Alexander Thom's work, whose survey results of [[megalith]]ic sites hypothesized widespread practice of accurate astronomy in the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;Thom 1988:9-10&lt;/ref&gt;  Euan MacKie, recognizing that Thom's theories needed to be tested, excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter's prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct. There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom's long alignment hypothesis (Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate winter solstice site) led him to check Thom's geometrical theories at the Cultoon stone circle in Islay, also with a positive result. MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom's conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain.&lt;ref name = &quot;zkuawc&quot;&gt;MacKie 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast a re-evaluation of Thom's fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom's claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless Thom's legacy remains strong, Krupp&lt;ref&gt;Krupp 1979:18&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in 1979, &quot;Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeo-astronomical fieldwork and interpretation, and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades.&quot; His influence endures and practice of [[statistical]] testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iwaniszewski 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Uxmal01-panorama.jpg|thumb|leftt|250px|It has been proposed that [[Maya civilization|Maya]] sites such as [[Uxmal]] were built in accordance with astronomical alignments.]]The approach in the [[New World]], where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in [[Amerindian]] civilizations, was markedly different. They had access to sources that the [[prehistory]] of Europe lacks such as [[ethnography|ethnographies]]&lt;ref&gt;Zeilik 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeilik 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[history|historical]] records of the early [[Colonization of the Americas|colonizers]]. Following the pioneering example of Anthony Aveni,&lt;ref&gt;Milbraith 1999:8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broda 2000:233&lt;/ref&gt; this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation. The concentration on historical data led to some claims of high accuracy that were comparatively weak when compared to the statistically led investigations in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

This came to a head at a meeting sponsored by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] in [[Oxford]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 1993:ix&lt;/ref&gt; The [[methodology|methodologies]] and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heggie 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research,&lt;ref&gt;Aveni, 1989a:xi–xiii&lt;/ref&gt; which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky.

== Archaeoastronomy and its relations to other disciplines ==
{{quote|...[O]ne of the most endearing characteristics of archaeoastronomy is its capacity to set academics in different disciplines at loggerheads with each other.|Clive Ruggles&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2000&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Archaeoastronomy has long been seen as an interdisciplinary field that uses written and unwritten evidence to study the astronomies of other cultures.  As such, it can be seen as connecting other disciplinary approaches for investigating ancient astronomy: astroarchaeology (an obsolete term for studies that draw astronomical information from the alignments of ancient architecture and landscapes), [[history of astronomy]] (which deals primarily with the written textual evidence), and ethnoastronomy (which draws on the ethnohistorical record and contemporary ethnographic studies).&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1981: 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 2003: 150&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting Archaeoastronomy's development as an interdisciplinary subject, research in the field is conducted by investigators trained in a wide range of disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work as concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. Only rarely did they describe their work as astronomical, and then only as a secondary category.&lt;ref&gt;McCluskey 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Both practicing archaeoastronomers and observers of the discipline approach it from different perspectives. George Gummerman and Miranda Warburton view archaeoastronomy as part of an archaeology informed by [[cultural anthropology]] and aimed at understanding a &quot;group's conception of themselves in relation to the heavens', in a word, its cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Gummerman &amp; Warburton 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Todd Bostwick argued that &quot;archaeoastronomy is anthropology – the study of human behavior in the past and present.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bostwick 2006:3&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Bahn]] has described archaeoastronomy as an area of cognitive archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Bahn 1996:49&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers relate archaeoastronomy to the history of science, either as it relates to a culture's observations of nature and the conceptual framework they devised to impose an order on those observations&lt;ref&gt;McCluskey 2001&lt;/ref&gt; or as it relates to the political motives which drove particular historical actors to deploy certain astronomical concepts or techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Broda 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldana 2007:14-15&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historian Richard Poss took a more flexible approach, maintaining that the astronomical rock art of the North American Southwest should be read employing &quot;the hermeneutic traditions of western art history and art criticism&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Poss 2005:97&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers, however, raise different questions, seeking to provide their students with identifiable [[Precursorism|precursors]] of their discipline, and are especially concerned with the important question of how to confirm that specific sites are, indeed, intentionally astronomical.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer 2006a:30&lt;/ref&gt;

The reactions of professional archaeologists to archaeoastronomy have been decidedly mixed. Some expressed incomprehension or even hostility, varying from a rejection by the archaeological mainstream of what they saw as an archaeoastronomical fringe to an incomprehension between the cultural focus of archaeologists and the quantitative focus of early archaeoastronomers.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 1999: 3-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet archaeologists have increasingly come to incorporate many of the insights from archaeoastronomy into archaeology textbooks&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and, as mentioned above, some students wrote archaeology dissertations on archaeoastronomical topics.

Since archaeoastronomers disagree so widely on the characterization of the discipline, they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy to the study of culture, using the term ''Astronomy in Culture'' or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees an important part of the discipline as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of the discipline ''Archaeotopography.''&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin 2001:13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruggles and Saunders proposed ''Cultural Astronomy'' as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles &amp; Saunders 1993:1-31&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are [[cosmology|cosmologies]] and people who object to the use of [[logos]] have suggested adopting the Spanish ''cosmovisión''.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:115-117&lt;/ref&gt;

When debates polarise between techniques, the methods are often referred to by a colour code, based on the colours of the bindings of the two volumes from the first Oxford Conference, where the approaches were first distinguished.&lt;ref name = &quot;jgswke&quot;&gt;Aveni 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Green ([[Old World]]) archaeoastronomers rely heavily on statistics and are sometimes accused of missing the cultural context of what is a social practice. Brown ([[New World]]) archaeoastronomers in contrast have abundant ethnographic and historical evidence and have been described as 'cavalier' on matters of measurement and statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin 2001:2&lt;/ref&gt; Finding a way to integrate various approaches has been a subject of much discussion since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles &amp; Saunders. 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iwaniszewski 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
{{quote|For a long time I have believed that such diversity requires the invention of some all-embracing theory. I think I was very naïve in thinking that such a thing was ever possible.|Stanislaw Iwaniszewski&lt;ref&gt;Iwaniszewski 2003:7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is no one way to do Archaeoastronomy. The divisions between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.

===Green archaeoastronomy===

Green Archaeoastronomy is named after the cover of the book ''Archaeoastronomy in the Old World''.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1989:1&lt;/ref&gt; It is based primarily on statistics and is particularly apt for prehistoric sites where the social evidence is relatively scant compared to the historic period. The basic methods were developed by Alexander Thom during his extensive surveys of British megalithic sites.

Thom wished to examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He believed that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge on the other side for a 'double sunset'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a [[hypothetical]] site, one the day before the summer solstice and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset.  Horizon astronomy is arguably inaccurate, due to variations in refraction.

&lt;center&gt;[[File:Doublesunset.ogg]]&lt;/center&gt;

To test this idea he surveyed hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but he planned to show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing that there was an astronomical intent to the orientation of at least some of the alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two [[solstice]]s, the two [[equinox]]es and four [[cross-quarter day]]s, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Thom 1967: 107-117&lt;/ref&gt; While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.

Euan MacKie has supported Thom's analysis, to which he added an archaeological context by comparing Neolithic Britain to the Mayan civilization to argue for a stratified society in this period.&lt;ref name = &quot;zkuawc&quot;/&gt; To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland. Kintraw is a site notable for its four-meter high standing stone. Thom proposed that this was a foresight to a point on the distant horizon between Beinn Shianaidh and Beinn o'Chaolias on Jura.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 1999:25-29&lt;/ref&gt; This, Thom argued, was a notch on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter. However, from ground level, this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape, and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters: another observation platform was needed. This was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones. The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the petrofabric analysis was inconclusive, but further research at [[Maes Howe]]&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKie 1997&quot;&gt;MacKie 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and on the [[Bush Barrow]] Lozenge&lt;ref&gt;MacKie 2006:362&lt;/ref&gt; led MacKie to conclude that while the term 'science' may be anachronistic, Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high-accuracy alignments.&lt;ref&gt;MacKie 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast Clive Ruggles has argued that there are problems with the selection of data in Thom's surveys. meaning that the arguments for high accuracy astronomy are unproven.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 1999:19-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles and Barclay 2000: 69-70&lt;/ref&gt; A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer ''whether'' there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer ''why'' people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: &quot;To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn’t inform the current interpretive questions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kintigh 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brown archaeoastronomy ===

In contrast to the largely alignment-oriented statistically-led methods of Green archaeoastronomy, Brown archaeoastronomy has been identified as being closer to the [[history of astronomy]] or to [[cultural history]], insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual.&lt;ref name = &quot;jgswke&quot;/&gt; The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

One famous site where historical records have been used to interpret sites is [[Chichen Itza]]. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]ns and then sought archaeological correlates. One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet [[Venus]]. This interest is attested to by the [[Dresden codex]] which contains tables with information about the Venus's appearances in the sky.&lt;ref name = &quot;mlxqkn&quot;&gt;Kelley and Milone 2005:369-370&lt;/ref&gt; These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with [[Quetzalcoatl]] or [[Xolotl]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelley and Milone 2005:367-8&lt;/ref&gt; Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza.

[[Image:Chichen Itza Observatory 2 1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|&quot;El Caracol&quot; a possible observatory temple at Chichen Itza.]]The Temple of the Warriors bears iconography depicting feathered serpents associated with Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. This means that the building's alignment towards the place on the horizon where Venus first appears in the evening sky (when it coincides with the rainy season) may be meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;Milbraith 1988:70-71&lt;/ref&gt; Aveni claims that another building associated with the planet Venus in the form of Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the [[Caracol]].&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 2006:60-64&lt;/ref&gt; This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1979:175-183&lt;/ref&gt; However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing a suitable place to view out.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1997:137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Aveni states that one of the strengths of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the [[Inca]]s as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ''ceques'' radial routes emanating from the capital at [[Cusco]]. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1989:5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bauer and Dearborn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the [[Han dynasty]], in the second century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Xu ''et al.'' 2000:1-7&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of this method is that it can be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned the how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer 2006a:42-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer 2006b&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy.&lt;ref&gt;Iwaniszewski 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies are more likely to be considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like [[analogy]] and [[homology (anthropology)|homology]] and if they can demonstrate an understanding of [[accuracy and precision]] found in astronomy.

== Source materials ==

Because archaeoastronomy is about the many and various ways people interacted with the sky, there are a diverse range of sources giving information about astronomical practices.

===Alignments===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[History of astronomy]] --&gt;

A common source of data for archaeoastronomy is the study of alignments. This is based on the assumption that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.

An alignment is calculated by measuring the [[azimuth]], the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, 2005:112-113&lt;/ref&gt; The azimuth is usually measured using a [[theodolite]] or a [[compass]]. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its [[magnetic declination]] must be taken into account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060304060347/http://www.brunton.com/manuals/current/Compasses/Transit.pdf |format=PDF|title=''Brunton Pocket Transit Instruction Manual'', p. 22|accessdate=2008-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theodolite can be considerably more accurate if used correctly, but it is also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be [[calibration|calibrated]] using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:423-425&lt;/ref&gt; Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a [[clinometer]].

=== Artifacts ===

[[Image:NAMA Machine d'Anticythère 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Antikythera mechanism (main fragment)]]For artifacts such as the [[Nebra skydisk|Sky Disc of Nebra]], alleged to be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos,&lt;ref&gt;Scholsser 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meller 2004&lt;/ref&gt; the analysis would be similar to typical [[Archaeology#Post-excavation analysis|post-excavation analysis]] as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is examined and attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.

A more mundane example is the presence of [[astrological symbol]]s found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings.&lt;ref&gt;van Driel-Murray 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice and with the historical records of the time.

Another well-known artefact with an astronomical use is the [[Antikythera mechanism]]. In this case analysis of the artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device. The argument is bolstered by the presence of symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.&lt;ref&gt;T. Freeth ''et al.'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art and inscriptions ===

[[Image:Fajadadiagram.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Diagram showing the location of the sun daggers on the [[Fajada Butte]] petroglyph on various days]]Art and inscriptions may not be confined to artefacts, but also appear painted or inscribed on an archaeological site. Sometimes inscriptions are helpful enough to give instructions to a site's use. For example a Greek inscription on a stele (from [[Itanos (city)|Itanos]]) has been translated as:&quot;Patron set this up for Zeus Epopsios. Winter solstice. Should anyone wish to know: off ‘the little pig’ and the stele the sun turns.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Inscriptiones Creticae III iv 11; Isager and Skydsgaard 1992:163&lt;/ref&gt; From Mesoamerica come [[Maya codices|Mayan]] and [[Aztec codices]]. These are folding books made from [[Amatl]], processed tree bark on which are [[glyphs]] in [[Maya script|Mayan]] or [[Aztec script]]. The [[Dresden codex]] contains information regarding the Venus cycle, confirming its importance to the Mayans.&lt;ref name = &quot;mlxqkn&quot;/&gt;

More problematic are those cases where the movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with [[petroglyph]]s. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of [[Fajada Butte]] at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph.&lt;ref&gt;Sofaer 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the dagger on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the solstices a dagger can be seen either through the heart of the spiral or to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Fountain 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robins &amp; Ewing 1989&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices.&lt;ref&gt;Preston &amp; Preston 2005: 115-118&lt;/ref&gt; If no ethnographic nor historical data are found which can support this assertion then acceptance of the idea relies upon whether or not there are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance. It is helpful when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. This allows ethnoastronomers to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols.

=== Ethnographies ===

As well as the materials left by peoples themselves, there are also the reports of other who have encountered them. The historical records of the [[Conquistadores]] are a rich source of information about the precolumbian Americans. [[Ethnography|Ethnographers]] also provide material about many other peoples.

Aveni uses the importance of zenith passages as an example of the importance of ethnography. For peoples living between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn there are two days of the year when the noon Sun passes directly overhead and casts no shadow. In parts of Mesoamerica this was considered a significant day as it would herald the arrival of rains, and so play a part in the cycle of agriculture. This knowledge is still considered important amongst Mayan Indians living in Central America today. The ethnographic records suggested to archaeoastronomers that this day may have been important to the ancient Mayans. Alignments to the sunrise and sunset on the day of the zenith passage have been found in Mayan cities such as Chichen Itza. There are also shafts known as 'zenith tubes' which illuminate subterranean rooms when the sun passes overhead found at places like [[Monte Alban]]  and [[Xochicalco]]. It is only through the ethnography that we can speculate that the timing of the illumination was considered important in Mayan society.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1980:40-43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chaco canyon pueblo bonito petroglyphs.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An alleged 'supernova petroglyph' at Pueblo Bonito]]Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At [[Pueblo Bonito]], in [[Chaco Canyon]] can be found a petroglyph with a star, crescent and hand. It has been argued that this is a record of the [[SN 1054|1054 Supernova]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandt and Williamson 1979&lt;/ref&gt; However anthropological evidence suggests this is not the case. The Zuni who live in the region mark sun-watching stations with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, which can also be found at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:89&lt;/ref&gt; The local peoples appear to have adopted the supernova explanation ''after'' it was suggested by visitors to the site.&lt;ref&gt;Young 2005:23-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnoastronomy is also an important field outside of the Americas. For example anthropological work with Aboriginal Australians is producing much information about their [[Aboriginal astronomy|Indigenous astronomies]]&lt;ref&gt;Cairns 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and about their interaction with the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Saethre 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recreating the ancient sky ==
{{quote|...[A]lthough different ways to do science and different scientific results do arise in different cultures, this provides little support for those who would use such differences to question the sciences' ability to provide reliable statements about the world in which we live.|Stephen McCluskey&lt;ref&gt;McCluskey 2005:78&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Once the researcher has data to test, it is often necessary to attempt to recreate ancient sky conditions to place the data in its historical environment.

=== Declination ===
{{Main|Declination}}

To calculate what astronomical features a structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If you were to go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole.&lt;ref name = &quot;byuqqi&quot;&gt;Ruggles 1999:18&lt;/ref&gt; The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as ''declination''. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where you are on the globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.

{{clear}}

[[Image:Decdiag600.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Diagram of the visible portions of sky at varying latitudes.]]

{{clear}}

=== Solar positioning ===

While the stars are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not. The rising point of the Sun varies throughout the year. It swings between two limits marked by the solstices a bit like a [[pendulum]], slowing as it reaches the extremes, but passing rapidly through the mid-point. If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5° then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice.&lt;ref&gt;A.F. Aveni 1997:23-27&lt;/ref&gt; For more information see [[History of solar observation]].

=== Lunar positioning ===

The Moon's appearance is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits — known as [[lunastice|''luna''stices]] rather than ''sol''stices. However, its travel between lunastices is considerably faster. It takes a [[Sidereal month#Sidereal month|sidereal month]] to complete its cycle rather than the year long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunastices marking the limits of the Moon's movement move on [[Lunar standstill|an 18.6 year cycle]]. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the limits of the range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the ''[[Lunar phase|phase]]'' of the Moon. The cycle from one [[New Moon]] to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the [[Synodic month]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 1999:36-37&lt;/ref&gt; Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See [[Moon]] for more details.

=== Stellar positioning ===
{{Main|Precession of the equinoxes}}

[[Image:Earth precession.jpg|thumb|right|Precessional movement.]]Finally there is often a need to correct for the apparent movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a [[spinning top]]. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:345-347&lt;/ref&gt; The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around [[Polaris]] as they do now. In the case of the [[Egyptian pyramids]], it has been shown they were aligned towards [[Thuban]], a faint star in the constellation of [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:354-355&lt;/ref&gt; The effect can be substanstial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation [[Capricornus|Capricorn]]. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].

=== Transient phenomena ===

[[Image:Tapestry of bayeux10.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Halley's Comet depicted on the [[Bayeux tapestry]]]]Additionally there are often transient phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like [[eclipse]]s. In the case of [[solar eclipse]]s these can be used to date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by [[Herodotus]] enables us to date a battle between the [[Medes]] and the [[Lydia]]ns, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herodotus|authorlink=Herodotus|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+1.74.1|title=The Histories I.74|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other easily calculated events are [[supernovae]] whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.

Some [[comet]]s are predictable, most famously [[Halley's Comet]]. Yet as a class of object they remain unpredictable and can appear at any time. Some have extremely lengthy [[orbital period]]s which means their past appearances and returns cannot be predicted. Others may have only ever passed through the [[Solar System]] once and so are inherently unpredictable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/spacewatch/050701_bright_comets.html Predicting the next bright comet], Space.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meteor shower]]s should be predictable, but some [[meteor]]s are cometary debris and so require calculations of orbits which are currently impossible to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Steel 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Other events noted by ancients include [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]], [[sun dog]]s and [[rainbow]]s all of which are as impossible to predict as the ancient weather, but nevertheless may have been considered important phenomena.

{{quote|What has astronomy brought into the lives of cultural groups throughout history? The answers are many and varied...|Von Del Chamberlain and M. Jane Young&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain &amp; Young 2005:xi&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The use of calendars ===

A common justification for the need for astronomy is the need to develop an accurate [[calendar]] for [[agriculture|agricultural]] reasons. Ancient texts like [[Hesiod]]'s Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with [[ecology|ecological]] signs, such as [[bird migration]]s to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the [[Mursi people|Mursi]] of [[Ethiopia]] shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times in some parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Turton &amp; Ruggles 1978&lt;/ref&gt; All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.

An example of a non-agricultural calendar is the ''[[Tzolk'in]]'' calendar of the [[Maya civilization]] of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], which is a cycle of 260 days. This count is based on an [[260-day Mesoamerican calendar|earlier calendar and is found throughout Mesoamerica]]. This formed part of a more comprehensive system of [[Maya calendar]]s which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1989b&lt;/ref&gt;

Other peculiar calendars include ancient [[Hellenic calendar|Greek calendars]]. These were nominally [[Lunar calendar|lunar]], starting with the [[New Moon]]. In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates by both the civic calendar and ''ton theoi'', by the [[moon]].&lt;ref&gt;McCluskey 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of any universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as [[Panhellenic Games|games]] or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism may have been used as a politically neutral form of timekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;Salt &amp; Boutsikas 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Myth and cosmology ===

[[Image:Argo Navis Hevelius.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The constellation [[Argo Navis]] drawn by Johannes Hevelius in 1690.]]Another motive for studying the sky is to understand and explain the [[universe]]. In these cultures [[mythology|myth]] was a tool for achieving this and the explanations, while not reflecting the standards of modern [[science]], are [[cosmology|cosmologies]].

The [[Inca]]s arranged their empire to demonstrate their cosmology. The capital, [[Cusco]], was at the centre of the empire and connected to it by means of ceques, conceptually straight lines radiating out from the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer &amp; Dearborn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; These ceques connected the centre of the empire to the four ''suyus'', which were regions defined by their direction from Cusco. The notion of a quartered cosmos is common across the [[Andes]]. Gary Urton, who has conducted fieldwork in the Andean villagers of Misminay, has connected this quartering with the appearance of the [[Milky Way]] in the night sky.&lt;ref&gt;Urton 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In one season it will bisect the sky and in another bisect it in a [[perpendicular]] fashion.

The importance of observing cosmological factors is also seen on the other side of the world. The [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]] is laid out to follow cosmic order though rather than observing four directions the Chinese saw five, [[North]], [[South]], [[East]], [[West]] and [[Centre (geometry)|Centre]]. The Forbidden City occupied the centre of ancient Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Krupp 1997a:196–9&lt;/ref&gt; One approaches the Emperor from the south, thus placing him in front of the [[Circumpolar constellation|circumpolar stars]]. This creates the situation of the heavens revolving around the person of the Emperor. The Chinese cosmology is now better known through its export as [[Feng Shui]].

There is also much information about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the [[constellation]]s. The Barasana of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin 1999:15–6&lt;/ref&gt; The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh-Jones 1982:191-3&lt;/ref&gt;

A more well-known source of constellation myth are the texts of the Greeks and Romans. The origin of their constellations remains a matter of vigorous and occasionally fractious debate.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blomberg 2003, esp page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Displays of power ===

[[Image:1st Pylon Karnak Temple.JPG|thumbnail|250px|left|The [[Precinct of Amun-Re]] was aligned on the midwinter solstice.]]

By including celestial motifs in clothing it becomes possible for the wearer to make claims the power on Earth is drawn from above. It has been said that the Shield of [[Achilles]] described by [[Homer]] is also a catalogue of constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In North America shields depicted in [[Comanche]] [[petroglyphs]] appear to include Venus symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Krupp 1997a:252–3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solstice|Solsticial]] alignments also can be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the [[Lake Titicaca#Isla del Sol|Island of the Sun]] (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in [[Lake Titicaca]], the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the [[Inca]] ruling elite. Ordinary [[Pilgrimage|pilgrims]] stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.&lt;ref&gt;Dearborn, Seddon &amp; Bauer, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt the temple of [[Amun-Re]] at [[Karnak]] has been the subject of much study. Evaluation of the site, taking into account the change over time of the [[obliquity of the ecliptic]] show that the Great Temple was aligned on the rising of the midwinter sun.&lt;ref&gt;Krupp 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The length of the corridor down which sunlight would travel would have limited illumination at other times of the year.

In a later period the [[Serapeum]] in [[Alexandria]] was also said to have contained a [[Sun|solar]] alignment so that, on a specific sunrise, a shaft of light would pass across the lips of the statue of [[Serapis]] thus symbolising the [[Sun]] saluting the god.&lt;ref&gt;Rufinus&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newgrange ===

[[Image:Newgrange Eingang Stein.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The sunlight enters the tomb at Newgrange via the roofbox built above the door.]]

{{Main|Newgrange}}

Newgrange is a passage tomb in the Republic of Ireland dating from around 3,300 to 2,900 BC&lt;ref&gt;Eogan 1991&lt;/ref&gt; For a few days around the Winter Solstice light shines along the central passageway into the heart of the tomb. What makes this notable is not that light shines in the passageway, but that it does not do so through the main entrance. Instead it enters via a hollow box above the main doorway discovered by Michael O'Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly 1982:123-124&lt;/ref&gt; It is this roofbox which strongly indicates that the tomb was built with an astronomical aspect in mind. Clive Ruggles notes:{{blockquote|...[F]ew people - archaeologists or astronomers- have doubted that a powerful astronomical symbolism was deliberately incorporated into the monument, demonstrating that a connection between astronomy and funerary ritual, at the very least, merits further investigation.&lt;ref name = &quot;byuqqi&quot;/&gt;}}

=== The Pyramids of Giza ===

[[Image:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|300px|The Giza Pyramids, part of the Giza Necropolis|right|thumb|250px|The pyramids of [[Giza]].]]

{{Main|Giza Necropolis}}

Since the first modern measurements of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by [[Flinders Petrie]], various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations.&lt;ref&gt;Belmonte 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer 1980&lt;/ref&gt; It was recently proposed that this was done by observing the positions of two stars in [[Ursa Major|the Plough / Big Dipper]] which was known to Egyptians as the thigh. It is thought that a vertical alignment between these two stars checked with a [[plumb bob]] was used to ascertain where North lay. The deviations from true North using this model reflect the accepted dates of construction.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that the pyramids were laid out as [[Graham Hancock#Orion Correlation Theory|a map of the three stars]]  in the belt of Orion,&lt;ref&gt;Hancock 1996:168&lt;/ref&gt; although this theory has been criticized by reputable astronomers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairall&quot;&gt;Fairall 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krupp&quot;&gt;Krupp 1997b&lt;/ref&gt;

=== El Castillo ===

[[Image:Head of serpent column.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Plumed Serpent]]

{{Main|El Castillo, Chichen Itza}}

El Castillo, also known as Kukulcán's Pyramid, is a [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Mesoamerican step-pyramid]] built in the centre of [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n center of [[Chichen Itza]] in Mexico. Several architectural features have suggested astronomical elements. Each of the stairways built into the sides of the pyramid has 91 steps. Along with the extra one for the platform at the top, this totals 365 steps, which is possibly one for each day of the year (365.25) or the number of lunar orbits in 10,000 rotations (365.01). A visually striking effect is seen every March and September as an unusual shadow occurs on the equinoxes. A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade of the northern stairway. The visual effect is of a serpent descending the stairway, with its head at the base in light. Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May, traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season&lt;ref&gt;Krupp 1997a:267-269&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stonehenge ===

[[Image:Summer Solstice Sunrise over Stonehenge 2005.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The sun rising over [[Stonehenge]] at the 2005 Summer [[Solstice]].]]

{{Main|Archaeoastronomy and Stonehenge}}

Many astronomical alignments have been claimed for Stonehenge, a complex of [[megalith]]s and [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]]s in the [[Salisbury Plain]] of England. The most famous of these is the midsummer alignment, where the Sun rises over the Heel Stone. However, this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter alignment, where the viewer is outside Stonehenge and sees the sun setting in the henge, is the more significant alignment, and the midsummer alignment may be a coincidence due to local topography.&lt;ref&gt;Parker Pearson ''et al.'' 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
As well as solar alignments, there are proposed lunar alignments. The four station stones mark out a rectangle. The short sides point towards the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset. The long sides if viewed towards the south-east, face the most southerly rising of the moon. Aveni notes these have never gained the acceptance which the claims solar alignments have.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 1997:65-66&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs 2006&lt;/ref&gt; noted the Heel Stone azimuth is one-seventh of circumference, matching the latitude of Avebury, while summer solstice sunrise azimuth is no longer equal to the construction era direction.

=== Maeshowe ===

[[Image:PicMaesEntrance.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The interior of [[Maeshowe]] chambered tomb.]]

{{Main|Maeshowe}}

This is an architecturally outstanding Neolithic chambered tomb on the Mainland of [[Orkney]] – probably dating to the early 3rd millennium BC, and where the setting sun at midwinter shines down the entrance passage into the central chamber (see Newgrange). In the 1990s further investigations were carried out to discover whether this was an accurate or an approximate solar alignment. Several new aspects of the site were discovered. In the first place the entrance passage faces the hills of the island [[Hoy]], about 10 miles away. Secondly, it consists of two straight lengths, angled at a few degrees to each other. Thirdly, the outer part is aligned towards the midwinter sunset position on a level horizon just to the left of Ward Hill on Hoy.  Fourthly the inner part points directly at the Barnhouse standing stone about 400m away and then to the right end of the summit of Ward Hill, just before it dips down to the notch between it at Cuilags to the right. This indicated line points to  sunset on the first Sixteenths of the solar year (according to A. Thom) before and after the winter solstice and the notch at the base of the right slope of the Hill is at the same declination. Fourthly a similar 'double sunset' phenomenon is seen at the right end of Cuilags, also on Hoy; here the date is the first Eighth of the year before and after the winter solstice, at the beginning of November and February respectively – the Old Celtic festivals of [[Samhain]] and [[Imbolc]]. This alignment is not indicated by an artificial structure but gains plausibility from the other two indicated lines.   Maeshowe is thus an extremely sophisticated calendar site which must have been positioned carefully in order to use the horizon foresights in the ways described.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKie 1997&quot;/&gt;

=== Uxmal ===

[[Image:Uxmal-Palace-of-the-Governor.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Palace of the Governor at Uxmal.]]

{{Main|Uxmal}}

Uxmal is a Mayan city in the Puuc Hills of [[Yucatán]], Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal is often used as an exemplar of why it is important to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an [[azimuth]] of 118º on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment is also towards a southerly rising of Venus which occurs once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius ''et cetera''? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards the rising of Venus, it is also covered in [[glyph]]s which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles 2005:163-165&lt;/ref&gt; It is the combination of the alignment and the ethnography which suggests that the city was built with cosmic order in mind.

== Fringe archaeoastronomy ==
{{see|Archaeoastronomy and Vedic chronology}}
{{quote|At least now we have all the archaeological facts to go along with the astronomers, the Druids, the Flat Earthers and all the rest.|Sir Jocelyn Stephens&lt;ref&gt;Sir Jocelyn Stephens quoted in ''The Times'', 8 July 1994, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Archaeoastronomy owes something of this poor reputation among scholars to its occasional misuse to advance a range of [[Pseudohistory|pseudo-historical]] accounts. During the 1930s Otto S. Reuter compiled a study entitled ''Germanische Himmelskunde'', or &quot;Teutonic Skylore&quot;. The astronomical orientations of ancient monuments claimed by Reuter and his followers would place the ancient Germanic peoples ahead of the [[Ancient Near East]] in the field of astronomy, demonstrating the intellectual superiority of the &quot;[[Aryan Race|Aryans]]&quot; (Indo-Europeans) over the [[Semites]].&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen 1982:269&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Nineteenth Century numerous scholars have sought to use [[Archaeoastronomy and Vedic chronology|archaeoastronomical calculations]] to demonstrate the antiquity of Ancient Indian Vedic culture, computing the dates of astronomical observations ambiguously described in ancient poetry to as early as 4000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Witzel 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Pingree]], a historian of Indian astronomy, condemned &quot;the scholars who perpetrate wild theories of prehistoric science and call themselves archaeoastronomers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pingree 1982:554-563, esp. p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently Gallagher,&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Pyle,&lt;ref&gt;Pyle 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barry Fell|Fell]]&lt;ref&gt;Fell 1983&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted inscriptions in West Virginia as a description in Celtic [[Ogham]] alphabet of the supposed winter solstitial marker at the site. The controversial translation was supposedly validated by a problematic archaeoastronomical indication in which the winter solstice sun shone on an inscription of the sun at the site. Subsequent analyses criticized its cultural inappropriateness, as well as its linguistic and archeaoastronomical&lt;ref&gt;Wise 2003&lt;/ref&gt; claims, to describe it as an example of &quot;[[Pseudoarchaeology|cult archaeology]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeoastronomical organisations and publications ==

There are currently three academic organisations for scholars of archaeoastronomy. [http://www.archaeoastronomy.org/ ISAAC&amp;mdash;the International Society for Archaeoastronomy and Astronomy in Culture]&amp;mdash;was founded in 1995 and now sponsors the Oxford conferences and ''Archaeoastronomy — the Journal of Astronomy in Culture''. [http://www.archeoastronomy.org/ SEAC&amp;mdash; La Société Européenne pour l’Astronomie dans la Culture]&amp;mdash;is slightly older; it was created in 1992. SEAC holds annual conferences in Europe and publishes refereed conference proceedings on an annual basis. There is also [http://www.arqueoastronomia.org/siac.htm SIAC&amp;mdash; La Sociedad Interamericana de Astronomía en la Cultura], primarily a [[Latin America]]n organisation which was founded in 2003.

Additionally the ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'' publishes many archaeoastronomical papers. For twenty-seven volumes it also published an annual supplement ''Archaeoastronomy''.

'''Andrzej Sapkowski''', born 21 June 1948 in [[Łódź]], is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[fantasy]] writer. Sapkowski studied economics, and before turning to writing, he had worked as a senior sales representative for a foreign trade company. His first [[short story]], ''[[The Witcher]] ''(''Wiedźmin''), was published in ''[[Fantastyka]]'', Poland's leading fantasy literary magazine, in 1986 and  was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a cycle of tales based on the world of ''The Witcher'', comprising three collections of short stories and five [[novel]]s. This cycle and his many other works have made him one of the best-known fantasy authors in Poland in the 1990s.

The main character of ''[[The Witcher]]'' (alternative translations: ''The Hexer'' and ''Spellmaker'') is [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]], a [[mutant]] assassin who has been trained since childhood to hunt down and destroy monsters. Geralt exists in an ambiguous moral universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At the same time cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to [[Raymond Chandler]]'s signature character [[Philip Marlowe]]. The world in which these adventures take place is heavily influenced by  [[Slavs|Slavic]] mythology.

Sapkowski has won five [[Zajdel Award]]s, including three for short stories &quot;Mniejsze zło&quot; (''Lesser Evil'') (1990), &quot;Miecz przeznaczenia&quot; (''Sword of Destiny'') (1992) and &quot;W leju po bombie&quot; (''In a Bomb Crater'') (1993), and two for the novels &quot;[[Krew elfów]]&quot; (''Blood of Elves'') (1994) and &quot;Narrenturm&quot; (2002).  He also won the Spanish [[Ignotus Award]], best anthology, for ''The Last Wish'' in 2003, and for &quot;Muzykanci&quot; (''The Musicians''), best foreign short story, same year.

In 1997, Sapkowski won the prestigious [[Polityka's Passport]] award,&lt;ref name=&quot;libraryThing&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is awarded annually to artists who have strong prospects for international success.

In 2001, a [[The Hexer#Film|Television Series]] based on the ''Witcher'' cycle was released in Poland and internationally, entitled ''Wiedźmin'' (''The Hexer''). A film by the same title was compiled from excerpts of the television series but both have been critical and box office failures.

Sapkowski's books have been translated into Czech, Russian, Lithuanian, German, Spanish, French, Ukrainian, Portuguese, Finnish, and others. An English translation of ''[[The Last Wish (book)|The Last Wish]]'' short story collection was published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/MP-41816/The-Last-Wish.htm&lt;/ref&gt; From 2009 the Witcher saga is published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/MP-43318/Blood-of-Elves.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish game publisher, CD Projekt, created a role-playing PC game based on this universe, called [[The Witcher (computer game)|The Witcher]], which was released in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewitcher.com/community/en/press_releases/18.html|title=The Witcher Official Website - Official Release Date!|accessdate=17 July 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070709103856/http://www.thewitcher.com/community/en/press_releases/18.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a mobile version of the game which has been created by Breakpoint Games and is being published by [[Hands-On Mobile]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handson.com Hands–On Mobile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in Western Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific.

An '''ammeter''' is a [[measuring instrument]] used to measure the [[electric current]] in a [[Electrical circuit|circuit]]. Electric currents are measured in [[ampere]]s (A), hence the name. Instruments used to measure smaller currents, in the milliampere or microampere range, are designated as ''milliammeters'' or ''microammeters''. Early ammeters were laboratory instruments which relied on the Earth's magnetic field for operation. By the late 19th century, improved instruments were designed which could be mounted in any position and allowed accurate measurements in electric power systems.

==History==
The relation between electric current, magnetic fields and physical forces was first noted by [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] who, in 1820, observed a [[compass]] needle was deflected from pointing North when a current flowed in an adjacent wire. The [[Galvanometer#Tangent_galvanometer|tangent galvanometer]] was used to measure currents using this effect, where the restoring force returning the pointer to the zero position was provided by the Earth's magnetic field. This made these instruments usable only when aligned with the Earth's field. Sensitivity of the instrument was increased by using additional turns of wire to multiply the effect – the instruments were called &quot;multipliers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Geddes, ''Looking back: how measuring electric current has improved through the ages'', ''IEEE Potentials'', Feb/Mar 1996, pages 40-42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The [[Jacques-Arsène d'Arsonval|D'Arsonval]] [[galvanometer]] is a '''moving coil''' ammeter. It uses [[magnetism|magnetic]] [[deflection]], where current passing through a coil causes the coil to move in a [[magnetic field]]. The modern form of this instrument was developed by Edward Weston (NOT the American photographer!), and uses two spiral springs to provide the restoring force. By maintaining a uniform air gap between the iron core of the instrument and the poles of its permanent magnet, the instrument has good linearity and accuracy. Basic meter movements can have full-scale deflection for currents from about 25 microamperes to 10 milliamperes and have linear scales.&lt;ref name=Spitzer72/&gt;

'''Moving iron''' ammeters use a piece of [[iron]] which moves when acted upon by the electromagnetic force of a fixed coil of wire. This type of [[Meter (electronics)|meter]] responds to both [[direct current|direct]] and [[alternating current|alternating]] currents (as opposed to the moving coil ammeter, which works on [[direct current]] only). The iron element consists of a moving vane attached to a pointer, and a fixed vane, surrounded by a coil. As alternating or direct current flows through the coil and induces a magnetic field in both vanes, the vanes repel each other and the moving vane deflects against the restoring force provided by fine helical springs.&lt;ref name=Spitzer72/&gt; The non-linear scale of these meters makes them unpopular.

An '''electrodynamic''' movement uses an electromagnet instead of the permanent magnet of the d'Arsonval movement. This instrument can respond to both alternating and direct current.&lt;ref name=Spitzer72/&gt;

In a '''hot-wire ammeter''', a current passes through a wire which expands as it heats. Although these instruments have slow response time and low accuracy, they were sometimes used in measuring radio-frequency current.&lt;ref name=Spitzer72&gt;Frank Spitzer and Barry Howarth, Principles of Modern Instrumentation, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York, 1972, ISBN 0-03-080208-3 chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital''' ammeter designs use an [[analog to digital converter]] (ADC) to measure the voltage across the shunt resistor; the digital display is calibrated to read the current through the shunt.

There is also a whole range of devices referred to as '''integrating ammeters'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/lc/local/notes/dr/Wiggler/Wigrad_BK.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dit.upc.es/lpdntt/biblio/BREUS/LEE97a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In these ammeters the amount of current is summed over time giving as a result the product of current and time, which is proportional to the energy transferred with that current. These can be used for energy meters ([[watt-hour meters]]) or for estimating the charge of [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[capacitor]].

==Picoammeter==
A '''picoammeter''', or pico ammeter, measures very low electrical current, usually from the picoampere range at the lower end to the milliampere range at the upper end. Picoammeters are used for sensitive measurements where the current being measured is below the theoretical limits of sensitivity of other devices, such as [[Multimeter]]s.

Most picoammeters use a &quot;virtual short&quot; technique and have several different measurement ranges that must be switched between to cover multiple [[Decade (log scale)|decades of measurement]]. Other modern picoammeters use [[Logarithmic scale|log compression]] and a &quot;current sink&quot; method that eliminates range switching and associated [[voltage spike]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ix Innovations, LLC|url=http://pocketpico.com/download/theoryofoperation.pdf|accessdate = 2010-19-19|title=PocketPico Ammeter Theory of Operation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

The majority of ammeters are either connected in series with the circuit carrying the current to be measured (for small fractional amperes), or have their shunt resistors connected similarly in series. In either case, the current passes through the meter or (mostly) through its shunt. They must not be connected to a source of voltage; they are designed for minimal burden, which refers to the voltage drop across the ammeter, which is typically a small fraction of a volt. They are almost a short circuit.

Ordinary Weston-type meter movements can measure only milliamperes at most, because the springs and practical coils can carry only limited currents. To measure larger currents, a [[resistor]] called a [[shunt (electrical)#Use in current measuring|''shunt'']] is placed in [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]] with the meter. The resistances of shunts is in the integer to fractional milliohm range. Nearly all of the current flows through the shunt, and only a small fraction flows through the meter. This allows the meter to measure large currents. Traditionally, the meter used with a shunt has a full-scale deflection (FSD) of {{nowrap|50 mV}}, so shunts are typically designed to produce a voltage drop of {{nowrap|50 mV}} when carrying their full rated current.

Zero-center ammeters are used for applications requiring current to be measured with both polarities, common in scientific and industrial equipment. Zero-center ammeters are also commonly placed in series with a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. In this application, the charging of the battery deflects the needle to one side of the scale (commonly, the right side) and the discharging of the battery deflects the needle to the other side. A special type of zero-center ammeter for testing high currents in cars and trucks has a pivoted bar magnet that moves the pointer, and a fixed bar magnet to keep the pointer centered with no current. The magnetic field around the wire carrying current to be measured deflects the moving magnet.

Since the ammeter [[Shunt_(electrical)#Use_in_current_measuring|shunt]] has a very low resistance, mistakenly wiring the ammeter in parallel with a voltage source will cause a [[short circuit]], at best blowing a fuse, possibly damaging the instrument and wiring, and exposing an observer to injury. 

In AC circuits, a [[Transformer#Current transformers|current transformer]] converts the magnetic field around a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] into a small AC current, typically either {{nowrap|1 A}} or {{nowrap|5 A}} at full rated current, that can be easily read by a meter. In a similar way, accurate AC/DC non-contact ammeters have been constructed using [[Hall effect]] magnetic field sensors. A portable hand-held [[clamp meter|clamp-on ammeter]] is a common tool for maintenance of industrial and commercial electrical equipment, which is temporarily clipped over a wire to measure current. Some recent types have a parallel pair of magnetically-soft probes that are placed on either side of the conductor.

'''Amanda Hesser''' (born 1972) is an American food writer, editor and cookbook author. She was the food editor of ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and the editor of ''[[T Living]]'', a quarterly publication of ''[[The New York Times]]''. 

==Life and career==
Hesser was born in [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]], [[Pennsylvania]]. After graduating with a degree in economics and finance from [[Bentley College]] in 1993, she studied cooking in Europe. With a grant from [[Les Dames d'Escoffier]], she worked in bakeries and restaurants in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]] and [[France]].

She spent two years in [[France]], where she worked for Anne Willan, the founder of [[Ecole de Cuisine La Varenne]]. It was during this time that Hesser's writings started appearing in newspapers and magazines, including ''[[The Washington Post]]''.

After finishing her first book, in 1997, Hesser was hired as a food reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]''. Hesser has since written about the influence of [[Costco]] on the wine industry. She has uncovered the politics behind the New York City Greenmarket. And she was the first reporter at a major publication to write about [[Ferran Adria]] of [[El Bulli]] in [[Spain]].

Early in her career at the paper, she wrote a controversial story in which she examined the failings of the popular chef [[Emeril Lagasse]].

Hesser applied for a buyout from the Times in late March 2008 and is no longer with the newspaper. She wrote her &quot;Recipe Redux&quot; feature for the Times magazine until February 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Amanda Hesser Blows Her Own Internet Bubble | date = 3 April 2008 | publisher = [[New York Magazine]] | url = http://nymag.com/daily/food/2008/04/amanda_hesser_out_at_the_times.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Amanda Hesser Sets Us Straight About Her Plans for the Future | date = 7 April 2008 | url = http://nymag.com/daily/food/2008/04/amanda_hesser_sets_us_straight.html | publisher = [[New York Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a chapter about her in [[Julie Powell]]’s book ''Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen'' and appears as herself in [[Julie &amp; Julia|the film adaptation]].

Hesser lives in [[Brooklyn Heights]] with her husband, [[Tad Friend]], a staff writer for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and their two children.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''anxiolytic''' (also '''antipanic''' or '''antianxiety agent'''&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/100020674|antianxiety agent}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[medication|drug]] used for the treatment of [[anxiety]], and its related psychological and physical symptoms. Anxiolytics have been shown to be useful in the treatment of [[anxiety disorder]]s.

[[Beta-receptor blocker]]s such as [[propranolol]] and [[oxprenolol]], although not anxiolytics, can be used to combat the [[somatic]] symptoms of anxiety.

Anxiolytics are also known as '''minor [[tranquilizer]]s''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/anxiolytic+tranquilizer|title=anxiolytic (tranquilizer)|work=Memidex (WordNet) Dictionary/Thesaurus |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term is less common in modern texts, and was originally derived from a dichotomy with [[major tranquilizer]]s, also known as [[neuroleptics]] or [[antipsychotics]].{{cn|date=January 2011}}

==Types of anxiolytics==
===Benzodiazepines===
{{Main|Benzodiazepine}}

Benzodiazepines are prescribed for short-term relief of severe and disabling anxiety. Benzodiazepines may also be indicated to cover the latent periods associated with the medications prescribed to treat an underlying anxiety disorder. They are used to treat a wide variety of conditions and symptoms and are usually a first choice when short-term [[Central nervous system|CNS]] [[sedation]] is needed. Longer-term uses include treatment for severe anxiety. There is a risk of a [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]] and [[rebound syndrome]] after continuous usage for longer than two weeks, and tolerance and dependence may occur if patients stay under this treatment for longer.&lt;ref&gt;Gelder, M, Mayou, R. and Geddes, J. 2005. Psychiatry. 3rd ed. New York: Oxford. pp236.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the added problem of the accumulation of drug [[metabolite]]s and adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lader M, Tylee A, Donoghue J |title=Withdrawing benzodiazepines in primary care |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=19–34 |year=2009 |pmid=19062773 |doi=10.2165/0023210-200923010-00002 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepines include:

* [[Alprazolam]] (Xanax)
* [[Chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium)
* [[Clonazepam]] (Klonopin)
* [[Diazepam]] (Valium)
* [[Lorazepam]] (Ativan)

Benzodiazepines exert their anxiolytic properties at moderate dosage. At higher dosage [[hypnotic]] properties occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Montenegro M, Veiga H, Deslandes A |title=[Neuromodulatory effects of caffeine and bromazepam on visual event-related potential (P300): a comparative study.] |journal=Arq Neuropsiquiatr |volume=63 |issue=2B |pages=410–5 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=16059590 |doi=10.1590/S0004-282X2005000300009 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0004-282X2005000300009&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Tofisopam]] (Emandaxin and Grandaxin) is a drug that is a benzodiazepine derivative. Like other benzodiazepines, it possesses anxiolytic properties, but, unlike other benzodiazepines, it does not have anticonvulsant, sedative, skeletal muscle relaxant, motor skill-impairing, or amnestic properties.

===SSRIs===
{{Main|Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor}}

''' Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors''' or '''serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor'''&lt;ref name=&quot;BARLOW&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Barlow, David H. Durand, V. Mark |title=Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach |edition=Fifth |page=239 |chapter=Chapter 7: Mood Disorders and Suicide |isbn=0495095567 |oclc=192055408 |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''SSRIs''') are a class of compounds typically used as [[antidepressant]]s in the treatment of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, and some [[personality disorder]]s. SSRIs are primarily classified as antidepressants and typically higher dosages are required to be effective against [[anxiety disorders]] than to be effective against depression but nevertheless most SSRIs have anxiolytic properties, but are [[anxiogenic]] when first initiating treatment, and in some individuals continue to be anxiety-provoking. For this reason, a low dose of a benzodiazepine is often used for several weeks when initiating SSRI/SNRI therapy in order to counteract the initial anxiety caused by the drugs until the therapeutic delay of the SSRI/SNRI is finished and the drug becomes effective.

===Azapirones===
{{Main|Azapirone}}

Azapirones are a class of [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] [[agonist]]s. They lack the sedation and the [[Substance use disorder|dependence]] associated with [[benzodiazepines]] and cause much less cognitive impairment[Quote Needed]. They may be less effective than benzodiazepines in patients who have been previously treated with benzodiazepines as they do not provide the sedation that these patients may expect or equate with anxiety relief. Currently approved azapirones include [[buspirone]] (Buspar) and [[tandospirone]] (Sediel). [[Gepirone]] (Ariza, Variza) is also in [[clinical development]].

===Barbiturates===
{{Main|Barbiturate}}

[[Barbiturate]]s exert an anxiolytic effect linked to the sedation they cause. The risk of abuse and addiction is high. Many experts consider these drugs obsolete for treating anxiety but valuable for the short-term treatment of severe insomnia, though only after benzodiazepines or non-benzodiazepines have failed. They are rarely prescribed anymore.

===Hydroxyzine===
[[Hydroxyzine]] (Atarax) is an old [[antihistamine]] originally approved for clinical use by the FDA in 1956. It possesses anxiolytic properties in addition to its antihistamine properties and is also licensed for the treatment of anxiety and tension. It is also used for its sedative properties as a premed before anesthesia or to induce sedation after anesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.medicinenet.com/hydroxyzine/article.htm|title= hydroxyzine (Vistaril, Atarax)|accessdate= 17 May 2008|author= medicine net|publisher= medicinenet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown to be as effective as [[benzodiazepines]] in the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]], while producing fewer side-effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Llorca PM, Spadone C, Sol O |title=Efficacy and safety of hydroxyzine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a 3-month double-blind study |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=11 |pages=1020–7 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12444816 |doi= |url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/privatepdf/2002/v63n11/v63n1112.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pregabalin===
[[Pregabalin]]'s therapeutic effect appears after 1 week of use and is similar in effectiveness to [[lorazepam]], [[alprazolam]], and [[venlafaxine]], but pregabalin has demonstrated superiority by producing more consistent therapeutic effects for psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms. Long-term trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], and, in addition, unlike benzodiazepines, it does not disrupt [[sleep architecture]] and produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment; it also has a low potential for abuse and dependence and may be preferred over the benzodiazepines for these reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bandelow | first1 = B. | last2 = Wedekind | first2 = D. | last3 = Leon | first3 = T. | title = Pregabalin for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a novel pharmacologic intervention. | journal = Expert Rev Neurother | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 769–81 | month = Jul | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1586/14737175.7.7.769 | pmid = 17610384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = RT. | title = Pregabalin: its efficacy, safety and tolerability profile in generalized anxiety. | journal = Drugs Today (Barc) | volume = 43 | issue = 9 | pages = 601–10 | month = Sep | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1358/dot.2007.43.9.1133188 | pmid = 17940637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Picamilon]] is a [[prodrug]] formed by combining [[niacin]] with [[GABA]] which is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and is then hydrolyzed into GABA and niacin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''antipsychotic''' (or '''neuroleptic''') is a [[tranquilizer|tranquilizing]] [[psychiatric medication]] primarily used to manage [[psychosis]] (including [[delusion]]s or [[hallucination]]s, as well as [[disordered thought]]), particularly in [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]]. A first generation of antipsychotics, known as [[typical antipsychotics]], was discovered in the 1950s. Most of the drugs in the second generation, known as [[atypical antipsychotics]], have been developed more recently, although the first atypical antipsychotic, [[clozapine]], was discovered in the 1950s and introduced clinically in the 1970s. Both generations of medication tend to block receptors in the brain's [[dopamine pathway]]s, but antipsychotic drugs encompass a wide range of receptor targets.

A number of harmful and undesired [[adverse effect|(adverse)]] effects have been observed, including lowered [[life expectancy]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, [[weight gain]], enlarged breasts and milk discharge in men and women ([[hyperprolactinaemia]]), lowered white blood cell count ([[agranulocytosis]]), [[Volition (psychology)|involuntary]] repetitive body movements ([[tardive dyskinesia]]), [[diabetes]], an inability to sit still or remain motionless ([[akathisia]]), [[sexual dysfunction]], a return of psychosis requiring increasing the dosage due to cells producing more neurochemicals to compensate for the drugs ([[Tardive Psychosis|tardive psychosis]]), and a potential for permanent [[chemical dependence]] leading to psychosis much worse than before treatment began, if the drug dosage is ever lowered or stopped ([[tardive dysphrenia]]).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Temporary withdrawal symptoms including insomnia, agitation, psychosis, and motor disorders may occur during dosage reduction of antipsychotics, and can be mistaken for a return of the underlying condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dilsaver-1988&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moncrieff-2006&quot;/&gt;

The development of new antipsychotics with fewer of these adverse effects and with greater relative effectiveness as compared to existing antipsychotics ([[efficacy]]), is an ongoing field of research.

==History==

The original antipsychotic drugs were happened upon largely by chance and then tested for their effectiveness. The first, [[chlorpromazine]], was developed as a surgical [[anesthetic]]. It was first used on psychiatric patients because of its powerful calming effect; at the time it was regarded as a &quot;chemical [[lobotomy]]&quot;. Lobotomy at the time was used to treat many behavioral disorders, including psychosis, although its effect was to markedly reduce behavior and mental functioning of all types. However, chlorpromazine proved to reduce the effects of psychosis in a more effective and specific manner than the extreme lobotomy-like sedation it was known for. The underlying neurochemistry involved has since been studied in detail, and subsequent antipsychotic drugs have been discovered by an approach that incorporates this sort of information.

The discovery of chlorpromazine's psychoactive effects in 1952 led to greatly reduced use of restraint, seclusion, and sedation in the management of agitated patients,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and also led to further research that resulted in the development of [[antidepressant]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s, and the majority of other drugs now used in the management of psychiatric conditions. In 1952, [[Henri Laborit]] described chlorpromazine only as inducing indifference towards what was happening around them in nonpsychotic, nonmanic patients, and [[Jean Delay]] and [[Pierre Deniker]] described it as controlling manic or psychotic agitation. The former claimed to have discovered a treatment for agitation in anyone, and the latter team claimed to have discovered a treatment for psychotic illness.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, D. 2005. Psychiatric Drugs Explained. 4th Ed. Britain:Elsevier Limited. P. 8, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antipsychotics have long been known as neuroleptic drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|six/000071860|neuroleptic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''neuroleptic'' was derived from the {{lang-el|&quot;[[wikt:νεῦρον|νεῦρον]]&quot;}} (''neuron'', originally meaning &quot;[[sinew]]&quot; but today referring to the [[nerve]]s) and &quot;[[wikt:λαμβάνω|λαμβάνω]]&quot; (''lambanō'', meaning &quot;take hold of&quot;). Thus, the word means ''taking hold of one's nerves''. This may refer to common side effects such as reduced activity, lethargy, and impaired motor control. Although these effects are unpleasant and in some cases harmful, they were at one time considered a reliable sign that the drug was working.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The term &quot;neuroleptic&quot; is being abandoned in favor of &quot;antipsychotic,&quot; which refers to the drug's desired effects. Typical antipsychotics have also been referred to as the major '''[[tranquilizer]]s''',&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|eight/000110128|tranquilizer}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of their tendency to [[tranquilizer|tranquilize]] and sedate. As with the term &quot;neuroleptics,&quot; the term &quot;major tranquilizers&quot; is falling out of common and scientific use. The term &quot;tranquilizers&quot; now generally refers to drugs that are primarily intended to sedate—mostly the [[barbiturate]]s and [[benzodiazepine]]s, which were once referred to as the &quot;minor tranquilizers.&quot;

Antipsychotics are broadly divided into two groups, the [[typical antipsychotic|typical or first-generation antipsychotics]] and the [[atypical antipsychotic|atypical or second-generation antipsychotics]]. The typical antipsychotics are classified according to their chemical structure while the atypical antipsychotics are classified according to their pharmacological properties. These include serotonin-dopamine antagonists (see [[dopamine antagonist]] and [[serotonin antagonist]]), multi-acting receptor-targeted antipsychotics (MARTA, those targeting several systems), and [[dopamine partial agonists]], which are often categorized as atypicals.&lt;ref name=Horacek2006&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Horacek J, Bubenikova-Valesova V, Kopecek M, et al. |title=Mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic drugs and the neurobiology of schizophrenia |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=389–409 |year=2006 |pmid=16696579 |doi=10.2165/00023210-200620050-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Common conditions with which antipsychotics might be used include [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]] and [[delusional disorder]]. Antipsychotics might also be used to counter psychosis associated with a wide range of other diagnoses, such as [[psychotic depression]]. However, not all symptoms require heavy medication and hallucinations and delusions should only be treated if they distress the patient or produce dangerous behaviors.

In addition, &quot;antipsychotics&quot; are increasingly used to treat non-psychotic disorders. For example, they are sometimes used [[off-label use|off-label]] to manage aspects of [[Tourette syndrome]] or [[autism spectrum disorder]]s. They have multiple off-label uses as an [[augmentation (psychiatry)|augmentation]] agent (i.e. in addition to another medication), for example in &quot;treatment-resistant&quot; depression&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:EdQ-6N0zzc4J:www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v05s03/v05s0306.pdf+antipsychotics+atypical+depression&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;sig=AHIEtbReoz7KlvOCNxeRQQ6XTnW0Tx5KDw Docs.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[OCD]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://focus.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/5/3/354 A Review of Antipsychotics in the Treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the name, the off-label use of &quot;antipsychotics&quot; is said to involve deploying them as antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, mood stabilizers, cognitive enhancers, anti-aggressive, anti-impulsive, anti-suicidal and hypnotic (sleep) medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Groleger U |title=Off-label use of antipsychotics: rethinking 'off-label' |journal=Psychiatria Danubina |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=350–3 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18000487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antipsychotics have also been increasingly used off-label in cases of [[dementia]] in older people, and for various disorders and difficulties in children and teenagers. A survey of children with [[pervasive developmental disorder]] found that 16.5% were taking an antipsychotic drug, most commonly to alleviate mood and behavioral disturbances characterized by irritability, aggression, and agitation. Recently, risperidone was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with autism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jci.org/articles/view/32483 Antipsychotics in the treatment of autism (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Antipsychotics are sometimes used as part of compulsory treatment via [[involuntary commitment|inpatient (hospital) commitment]] or [[outpatient commitment]]. This may involve various methods to persuade a person to take the medication, or actual physical force. Administration may rely on an [[injection (medicine)|injectable]] form of the drug rather than tablets. The injection may be of a long-lasting type known as a depot injection, usually applied at the top of the [[buttocks]].  Those that are available in injectable form are haloperidol, olanzapine, and ziprasidone while those available as depot are haloperidol, flupenthixol, clopenthixol, and risperidone.

Antipsychotics are among the biggest selling and most profitable of all drugs, generating $22&amp;nbsp;billion in global sales in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;healthcarefinancenews.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/press-release/pipeline-antipsychotic-drugs-drive-next-market-evolution Pipeline antipsychotic drugs to drive next market evolution (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003 in the US, an estimated 3.21&amp;nbsp;million patients received antipsychotics, worth an estimated $2.82&amp;nbsp;billion. Over 2/3 of prescriptions were for the newer more expensive atypicals, each costing on average $164 compared to $40 for the older types.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/57/12/1693 Antipsychotic Use and Expenditure in the United States (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, sales in the US reached $14.6&amp;nbsp;billion, the biggest selling drugs in the US by therapeutic class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imshealth.com/portal/site/imshealth/menuitem.a46c6d4df3db4b3d88f611019418c22a/?vgnextoid=85f4a56216a10210VgnVCM100000ed152ca2RCRD&amp;cpsextcurrchannel=1 2008 U.S. Sales and Prescription Information: Top Therapeutic Classes by U.S. Sales (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of prescriptions for children and adolescents doubled to 4.4&amp;nbsp;million between 2003 and 2006, in part because of increases in diagnoses of bipolar disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nation/6212152.html Newer antipsychotic drugs draw fresh scrutiny (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the chronic nature of the treated disorders, antipsychotic medications, once started, are seldom discontinued, and the aim of the treatment is often to gradually reduce dosage to a minimum safe maintenance dose that is enough to control the symptoms. Only when the side-effects have become too severe and/or a patient have been symptom-free for a long periods of time is discontinuation carefully attempted. Improper discontinuation or abrupt restarting of neuroleptics have been shown to cause dysfunction in regions of the [[brainstem]] as well as dysfunction of the [[autonomic nervous system]].

==Side effects==
Antipsychotics are associated with a range of side effects. It is well-recognized that many people stop taking them (around two-thirds even in controlled drug trials) due in part to adverse effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellack06&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bellack AS |title=Scientific and consumer models of recovery in schizophrenia: concordance, contrasts, and implications |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=432–42 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16461575 |pmc=2632241 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbj044}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Extrapyramidal side effect|Extrapyramidal]] reactions include acute [[dystonia]]s, [[akathisia]], [[parkinsonism]] (rigidity and [[tremor]]), [[tardive dyskinesia]], [[tachycardia]], [[hypotension]], [[impotence]], lethargy, [[seizure]]s, intense dreams or nightmares, and [[hyperprolactinaemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mangrella M, Motola G, Russo F, et al. |title=[Intensive hospital monitoring of adverse reactions to benzodiazepines and neuroleptic agents] |language=Italian |journal=Minerva Medica |volume=89 |issue=7-8 |pages=293–300 |year=1998 |pmid= 9824992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Side effects from antipsychotics can be managed by a number of different drugs. For example, [[anticholinergic]]s are often used to alleviate the motor side effects of antipsychotics.&lt;ref&gt;Healy 2009, p42. Psychiatric drugs explained 5th ED. Edinburgh : Elsevier Churchill Livingstone&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the side-effects will appear after the drug has been used only for a long time.

Some studies have found decreased life expectancy associated with the use of antipsychotics, and argued that more studies are needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schres-journal.com/article/S0920-9964(09)00233-3/abstract Influence of antipsychotics on mortality in schizophrenia: Systematic review (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/188/2/122 Schizophrenia, neuroleptic medication and mortality (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; In Feb. 2011, a minor loss of brain tissue was reported in schizophrenics treated with antipsychotics.&lt;ref name=brainloss&gt;[http://www.drugs.com/news/schizophrenia-may-spur-subtle-brain-tissue-loss-29416.html Schizophrenia Drugs May Spur Subtle Brain Tissue Loss]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Beng|Choon|last2=Andreasen|first2=Nancy C.|last3=Ziebell|first3=Stephen|last4=Pierson|first4=Ronald|last5=Magnotta|first5=Vincent|title=Long-term antipsychotic treatment and brain volumes: a longtitudinal study of first-episode schizophrenia|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|year=2011|month=Feb.|volume=68|issue=2|pages=128–37|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/68/2/128|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain volume was negatively correlated with both duration of illness and antipsychotic dosage. No association was found with severity of illness or abuse of other substances. An accompanying editorial said: &quot;The findings should not be construed as an indication for discontinuing the use of antipsychotic medications as a treatment for schizophrenia. But they do highlight the need to closely monitor the benefits and adverse effects of these medications in individual patients, to prescribe the minimal amount needed to achieve the therapeutic goal [and] to consider the addition of nonpharmacological approaches that may improve outcomes.&quot;&lt;ref name=brainloss/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=lewis|first=David A|title=Antipsychotic medications and brain volume: do we have a cause for concern?|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|year=2011|month=Feb.|volume=68|issue=2|pages=126–27|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/68/2/126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous use of neuroleptics has been shown to decrease the total brain volume by 10% in macaque monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;Dorph-Petersen, K-A, Pierri, J, Perel, J, Sun, Z, Sampson, A-R and Lewis, D (2005)  [http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v30/n9/abs/1300710a.html ''The Influence of Chronic Exposure to Antipsychotic Medications on Brain Size before and after Tissue Fixation: A Comparison of Haloperidol and Olanzapine in Macaque Monkeys.''] Neuropsychopharmacology, 30, 1649–1661&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;healthy&quot; individuals without psychosis, doses of antipsychotics can produce the so-called &quot;negative symptoms&quot; (e.g. emotional and motivational difficulties) associated with [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/163/3/488 Negative Signs and Symptoms Secondary to Antipsychotics: A Double-Blind, Randomized Trial of a Single Dose of Placebo, Haloperidol, and Risperidone in Healthy Volunteers (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

From a subjective perspective, antipsychotics heavily influence one's perceptions of pleasurable sensations, causing a severe reduction in feelings of desire, motivation, pensive thought, and awe. This does not coincide with the apathy and lack of motivation experienced by the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Detrimental effects on short term memory, which affect the way one figures and calculates (although this also may be purely subjective), may also be observed on high enough dosages. These are all the reasons why they are thought to affect &quot;creativity&quot;. Also, for some individuals with schizophrenia, too much stress may cause &quot;relapse&quot;.

Following are details concerning some of the side effects of antipsychotics:
* Antipsychotics, particularly atypicals, appear to cause [[diabetes mellitus]] and fatal [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], especially (in US studies) in [[African Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Torrey EF, Swalwell CI |title=Fatal olanzapine-induced ketoacidosis |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=12 |page=2241 |year=2003 |month= December |pmid=14638601 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.12.2241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Koller EA, Doraiswamy PM |title=Olanzapine-associated diabetes mellitus |journal= Pharmacotherapy |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=841–52 |year=2002 |month=July |pmid=12126218 |doi=10.1592/phco.22.11.841.33629}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Antipsychotics may cause [[pancreatitis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14524644&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Koller EA, Cross JT, Doraiswamy PM, Malozowski SN |title=Pancreatitis associated with atypical antipsychotics: from the Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch surveillance system and published reports |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=1123–30 |year= 2003 |month=September |pmid=14524644 |doi=10.1592/phco.23.10.1123.32759}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The atypical antipsychotics (especially olanzapine) seem to cause weight gain more commonly than the typical antipsychotics. The well-documented metabolic side effects associated with weight gain include diabetes, which can be life-threatening.&lt;ref name=&quot;weightCNS&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hasnain M, Vieweg WVR, Fredrickson SK |title=Metformin for Atypical Antipsychotic-Induced Weight Gain and Glucose Metabolism Dysregulation: Review of the Literature and Clinical Suggestions |url=http://adisonline.com/cnsdrugs/Abstract/2010/24030/Metformin_for_Atypical_Antipsychotic_Induced.2.aspx |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=193–206 |year=2010 |pmid=20155995 |doi=10.2165/11530130-000000000-00000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Clozapine also has a risk of inducing agranulocytosis, a potentially dangerous reduction in the number of white blood cells in the body. Because of this risk, patients prescribed clozapine may need to have regular blood checks to catch the condition early if it does occur, so the patient is in no danger.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoodmanGilman&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baldessarini |first=Ross J. |coauthors=Frank I.

* One of the more serious of these side effects is [[tardive dyskinesia]], in which the sufferer may show repetitive, involuntary, purposeless movements (that are permanent and have no cure) often of the lips, face, legs, or torso. It is believed that there is a greater risk of developing tardive dyskinesia with the older, typical antipsychotic drugs, although the newer antipsychotics are now also known to cause this disorder.
* A potentially serious side effect of many antipsychotics is that they tend to lower an individual's seizure threshold. Chlorpromazine and clozapine, in particular, have a relatively high seizurogenic potential. Fluphenazine, haloperidol, pimozide and risperidone exhibit a relatively low risk. Caution should be exercised in individuals that have a history of seizurogenic conditions such as [[epilepsy]], or [[brain damage]].
* [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], in which the drugs appear to cause the temperature regulation centers to fail, resulting in a medical emergency, as the patient's temperature suddenly increases to dangerous levels.
* [[Dysphoria]].
* Drug-induced parkinsonism due to [[dopamine D2 receptor]] blockade may mimic [[idiopathic]] parkinsonism. The typical antipsychotics are more prone to cause this, compared to the atypical antipsychotics.
* [[Sexual dysfunction]], which may rarely continue after withdrawal, similar to [[Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction]] (PSSD).
* [[Dystonia]], a neurological movement disorder in which sustained muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures.
* [[Hyperprolactinaemia]]. The breasts may enlarge and discharge milk, in both men and women due to abnormally-high levels of [[prolactin]] in the blood. Prolactin secretion in the pituitary is normally suppressed by dopamine. Drugs that block the effects of dopamine at the pituitary or deplete dopamine stores in the brain may cause the pituitary to secrete prolactin.
* There is evidence that exposure may cause [[demyelinating disease]] in laboratory animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Konopaske GT, Dorph-Petersen KA, Sweet RA, et al. |title= Effect of chronic antipsychotic exposure on astrocyte and oligodendrocyte numbers in macaque monkeys |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=759–65 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=17945195 |pmc=2386415 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.08.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people suffer few apparent side effects from taking antipsychotic medication, whereas others may have serious adverse effects.{{vague|any measurement?|date=April 2011}} Some side effects, such as subtle cognitive problems, may go unnoticed.

There is a possibility that the risk of tardive dyskinesia can be reduced by combining the anti-psychotics with [[diphenhydramine]] or [[benzatropine]], although this remains to be established. [[Central nervous system]] damage is also associated with irreversible tardive akathisia and/or tardive dysphrenia.

===Withdrawal===
Withdrawal symptoms from antipsychotics may emerge during dosage reduction and discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms can include [[nausea]], [[emesis]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[diarrhea]], [[rhinorrhea]], [[diaphoresis]], [[myalgia]], [[paresthesia]], [[anxiety]], agitation, restlessness, and [[insomnia]]. The psychological withdrawal symptoms can include psychosis, and can be mistaken for a relapse of the underlying disorder. Conversely, the withdrawal syndrome may also be a trigger for relapse. Better management of the withdrawal syndrome may improve the ability of individuals to discontinue antipsychotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dilsaver-1988&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Dilsaver | first1 = SC. | last2 = Alessi | first2 = NE. | title = Antipsychotic withdrawal symptoms: phenomenology and pathophysiology. | journal = Acta Psychiatr Scand | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–6 | month = Mar | year = 1988 | doi =  10.1111/j.1600-0447.1988.tb05116.x| pmid = 2899377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moncrieff-2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Moncrieff | first1 = J. | title = Why is it so difficult to stop psychiatric drug treatment?

Withdrawal effects may also occur  when switching a person from one antipsychotic to another, (presumably due to variations of potency and receptor activity). Such withdrawal effects can include [[cholinergic]] rebound, an activation syndrome, and motor syndromes including [[dyskinesias]]. These adverse effects are more likely during rapid changes between antipsychotic agents, so making a gradual change between antipsychotics minimises these withdrawal effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambert-2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Lambert | first1 = TJ. | title = Switching antipsychotic therapy: what to expect and clinical strategies for improving therapeutic outcomes. | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 68 Suppl 6 | issue = | pages = 10–3 | month = | year = 2007 | doi = | pmid = 17650054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British National Formulary]] recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-first=BMJ |editor1-last=Group |title=British National Formulary |edition=57 |year=2009 |month=March |publisher=Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0260-535X |page=192 |chapter=4.2.1 |quote=Withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs after long-term therapy should always be gradual and closely monitored to avoid the risk of acute withdrawal syndromes or rapid relapse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy==
There have been a large number of studies of the [[efficacy]] of typical antipsychotics, and an increasing number on the more recent atypical antipsychotics.

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] and the UK [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] recommend antipsychotics for managing acute psychotic episodes in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and as a longer-term maintenance treatment for reducing the likelihood of further episodes.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association (2004) Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia. Second Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Royal College of Psychiatrists &amp; The British Psychological Society (2003). [http://www.nice.org.uk/download.aspx?o=289559 ''Schizophrenia. Full national clinical guideline on core interventions in primary and secondary care''] (PDF). London: Gaskell and the British Psychological Society.&lt;/ref&gt; They state that response to any given antipsychotic can be variable so that trials may be necessary, and that lower doses are to be preferred where possible. A number of studies have looked at levels of &quot;compliance&quot; or &quot;adherence&quot; with antipsychotic regimes and found that discontinuation (stopping taking them) by patients is associated with higher rates of relapse, including hospitalization.

Nevertheless, a 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis of trials in people diagnosed with schizophrenia found that less than half (41%) showed any therapeutic [[response]] to an antipsychotic, compared to 24% on placebo, and that there was a decline in treatment response over time, and possibly a bias in which trial results were published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v14/n4/abs/4002136a.html How effective are second-generation antipsychotic drugs? A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a 2010 [[Cochrane Collaboration]] review of trials of Risperidone, one of the biggest selling antipsychotics and the first of the new generation to become available in [[generic drug|generic]] form, found only marginal benefit compared with placebo and that, despite its widespread use, evidence remains limited, poorly reported and probably biased in favor of risperidone due to pharmaceutical company funding of trials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/NeLM-Area/Evidence/Drug-Specific-Reviews/Cochrane-review-Risperidone-versus-placebo-for-schizophrenia/ Risperidone versus placebo for schizophrenia. Cochrane Database of Systematic (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; Another Cochrane review in 2009, of bipolar disorder, found the efficacy and risk/benefit ratio better for the traditional mood stabilizer [[lithium]] than for the antipsychotic Olanzapine as a first line maintenance treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cipriani A, Rendell JM, Geddes J |title=Olanzapine in long-term treatment for bipolar disorder |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Online) |issue=1 |pages= CD004367 |year=2009 |pmid=19160237 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004367.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antipsychotic [[polypharmacy]] (prescribing two or more antipsychotics at the same time for an individual) is said to be a common practice but not necessarily evidence-based or recommended, and there have been initiatives to curtail it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Patrick V, Levin E, Schleifer S |title=Antipsychotic polypharmacy: is there evidence for its use? |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Practice |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=248–57 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=16041235 |doi=10.1097/00131746-200507000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the use of excessively high doses (often the result of polypharmacy) continues despite clinical guidelines and evidence indicating that it is usually no more effective but is usually more harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ito H, Koyama A, Higuchi T |title=Polypharmacy and excessive dosing: psychiatrists' perceptions of antipsychotic drug prescription |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=187 |pages=243–7 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16135861 |doi=10.1192/bjp.187.3.243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review by the US [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] found that much of the evidence for the off-label use of antipsychotics (for example, for depression, dementia, OCD, PTSD, Personality Disorders, Tourette's) was of insufficient scientific quality to support such use, especially as there was strong evidence of increased risks of stroke, tremors, significant weight gain, sedation, and gastrointestinal problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahrq.gov/news/press/pr2007/antipsypr.htm Evidence Lacking to Support Many Off-label Uses of Atypical Antipsychotics (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; A UK review of unlicensed usage in children and adolescents reported a similar mixture of findings and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1192/apt.bp.108.005652 |title=Prescribing antipsychotics for children and adolescents |year=2010 |last=James |first=A.C. |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=16 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressive challenging behavior in adults with [[intellectual disability]] is often treated with antipsychotic drugs despite lack of an evidence base. A recent [[randomized controlled trial]], however, found no benefit over [[placebo]] and recommended that the use of antipsychotics in this way should no longer be regarded as an acceptable routine treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Romeo R, Knapp M, Tyrer P, Crawford M, Oliver-Africano P |title=The treatment of challenging behaviour in intellectual disabilities: cost-effectiveness analysis |journal=Journal of Intellectual Disability Research |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=633–43 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19460067 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2009.01180.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 [[Cochrane Collaboration]] review of controlled trials of antipsychotics in old age [[dementia]] reported that one or two of the drugs showed a modest benefit compared to placebo in managing aggression or psychosis, but that this was combined with a significant increase in serious adverse events. They concluded that this confirms that antipsychotics should not be used routinely to treat dementia patients with aggression or psychosis, but may be an option in the minority of cases where there is severe distress or risk of physical harm to others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003476.html Atypical antipsychotics for aggression and psychosis in Alzheimer's disease (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some doubts have been raised about the long-term effectiveness of antipsychotics for schizophrenia, in part because two large international [[World Health Organization]] studies found individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia tend to have better long-term outcomes in developing countries (where there is lower availability and use of antipsychotics and mental health problems are treated with more informal, community-led methods only) than in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jablensky A, Sartorius N, Ernberg G, Anker M, Korten A, Cooper J, Day R, Bertelsen A |title=Schizophrenia: manifestations, incidence and course in different cultures.

Some argue that the evidence for antipsychotics from discontinuation-relapse studies may be flawed, because they do not take into account that antipsychotics may sensitize the brain and provoke psychosis if discontinued, which may then be wrongly interpreted as a relapse of the original condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Moncrieff J |title=Does antipsychotic withdrawal provoke psychosis?

A review of the methods used in trials of antipsychotics, despite stating that the overall quality is &quot;rather good,&quot; reported issues with the selection of participants (including that in schizophrenia trials up to 90% of people who are generally suitable do not meet the elaborate inclusion and exclusion criteria, and that negative symptoms have not been properly assessed despite companies marketing the newer antipsychotics for these); issues with the design of trials (including pharmaceutical company funding of most of them, and inadequate [[blind experiment|experimental &quot;blinding&quot;]] so that trial participants could sometimes tell whether they were on placebo or not); and issues with the assessment of outcomes (including the use of a minimal reduction in scores to show &quot;response,&quot; lack of assessment of quality of life or recovery, a high rate of discontinuation, selective highlighting of favorable results in the abstracts of publications, and poor reporting of side-effects).&lt;ref&gt;[http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/34/2/275#BIB87 Methodological Issues in Current Antipsychotic Drug Trials (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typicals versus atypicals===
While the atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics were marketed as offering greater efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms while reducing side effects (and [[Extrapyramidal symptoms]] in particular) than typical medications, the results showing these effects often lacked robustness, and the assumption was increasingly challenged even as atypical prescriptions were soaring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Geddes J, Freemantle N, Harrison P, Bebbington P |title=Atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia: systematic overview and meta-regression analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=321 |issue=7273 |pages=1371–6 |year=2000 |month=December |pmid=11099280 |pmc=27538 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11099280 |doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7273.1371}}&lt;/ref&gt; One review concluded there were no differences&lt;ref name=Horacek2006/&gt; while another&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Leucht S, Wahlbeck K, Hamann J, Kissling W |title=New generation antipsychotics versus low-potency conventional antipsychotics: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9369 |pages=1581–9 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12747876 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13306-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that atypicals were &quot;only moderately more efficacious&quot;.&lt;ref name=Horacek2006/&gt; These conclusions were, however, questioned by another review, which found that clozapine, amisulpride, and olanzapine and risperidone were more effective&lt;ref name=Horacek2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Davis JM, Chen N, Glick ID |title=A meta-analysis of the efficacy of second-generation antipsychotics |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=553–64 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12796218 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.60.6.553}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clozapine]] has appeared to be more effective than other atypical antipsychotics,&lt;ref name=Horacek2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Tuunainen A, Wahlbeck K, Gilbody SM |title=Newer atypical antipsychotic medication versus clozapine for schizophrenia |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=2 |pages=CD000966 |year=2000 |pmid=10796559 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000966}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has previously been banned due to its potentially lethal side effects. While controlled clinical trials of atypicals reported that extrapyramidal symptoms occurred in 5–15% of patients, a study of bipolar disorder in a real world clinical setting found a rate of 63%, questioning the generalizability of the trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ghaemi SN, Hsu DJ, Rosenquist KJ, Pardo TB, Goodwin FK |title=Extrapyramidal side effects with atypical neuroleptics in bipolar disorder |journal=Progress in Neuro-psychopharmacology &amp; Biological Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=209–13 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16412546 |doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2005.10.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the US government body [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] published the results of a major independent (not funded by the pharmaceutical companies) multi-site, double-blind study (the CATIE project).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lieberman JA, Stroup TS, McEvoy JP, et al. |title=Effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs in patients with chronic schizophrenia |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=353 |issue=12 |pages=1209–23 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16172203 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa051688}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study compared several atypical antipsychotics to an older typical antipsychotic, [[perphenazine]], among 1493 persons with schizophrenia. The study found that only [[olanzapine]] outperformed perphenazine in discontinuation rate (the rate at which people stopped taking it due to its effects). The authors noted an apparent superior efficacy of olanzapine to the other drugs in terms of reduction in psychopathology and rate of hospitalizations, but olanzapine was associated with relatively severe metabolic effects such as a major weight gain problem (averaging {{convert|44|lb}} over 18 months) and increases in glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The mean and maximal doses used for olanzapine were considerably higher than standard practice, and this has been postulated as a biasing factor that may explain olanzapine's superior efficacy over the other atypical antipsychotics studied, where doses were more in line with clinically relevant practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bobo 2006&quot;&gt;Meltzer and Bobo (2006) &quot;Interpreting the Efficacy Findings in the CATIE Study: What Clinicians Should Know&quot; CNS Spectr.11(7 Suppl 7):14-24&lt;/ref&gt; No other atypical studied ([[risperidone]], [[quetiapine]], and [[ziprasidone]]) did better than the typical perphenazine on the measures used, nor did they produce fewer adverse effects than the typical antipsychotic perphenazine (a result supported by a meta-analysis by Dr. Leucht published in Lancet), although more patients discontinued perphenazine owing to extrapyramidal effects compared to the atypical agents (8% vs. 2% to 4%, P=0.002).

A phase 2 part of this CATIE study roughly replicated these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Stroup T |title=Effectiveness of olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia following discontinuation of a previous atypical antipsychotic |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=4 |pages=611–22 |year=2006 |pmid= 16585435 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.4.611 |last2=Lieberman |first2=JA |last3=McEvoy |first3=JP |last4=Swartz |first4=MS |last5=Davis |first5=SM |last6=Rosenheck |first6=RA |last7= Perkins |first7=DO |last8=Keefe |first8=RS |last9=Davis |first9=CE}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phase consisted of a second randomization of the patients that discontinued taking medication in the first phase. Olanzapine was again the only medication to stand out in the outcome measures, although the results did not always reach statistical significance (which means they were not reliable findings) due in part to the decrease of power. The atypicals again did not produce fewer extrapyramidal effects than perphenazine. A subsequent phase was conducted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=McEvoy J |title=Effectiveness of clozapine versus olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia that did not respond to prior atypical antipsychotic treatment |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=4 |pages=600–10 |year=2006 |pmid=16585434 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.4.600 |last2=Lieberman |first2=JA |last3=Stroup |first3=TS |last4=Davis |first4=SM |last5=Meltzer |first5=HY |last6=Rosenheck |first6=RA |last7=Swartz |first7=MS |last8=Perkins |first8=DO |last9=Keefe |first9=RS}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allowed clinicians to offer [[clozapine]] which was more effective at reducing medication drop-outs than other neuroleptic agents. However, the potential for clozapine to cause toxic side effects, including agranulocytosis, limits its usefulness.

It had been hoped that patient adherence to antipsychotics would be higher with the atypicals, but a 2008 review found that the data have failed to substantiate the notion that novel antipsychotic drug use leads to improved medication compliance and favorable clinical outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Voruganti LP, Baker LK, Awad AG |title=New generation antipsychotic drugs and compliance behaviour |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=133–9 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18332660 |doi= 10.1097/YCO.0b013e3282f52851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall evaluations of the CATIE and other studies have led many researchers to question the first-line prescribing of atypicals over typicals, or even to question the distinction between the two classes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apt.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/1/17 How CATIE brought us back to Kansas: a critical re-evaluation of the concept of atypical antipsychotics and their place in the treatment of schizophrenia (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=000135641 Typical and Atypical Antipsychotics - The Misleading Dichotomy (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, other researchers point to the significantly higher risk of tardive dyskinesia and EPS with the typicals and for this reason alone recommend first-line treatment with the atypicals, notwithstanding a greater propensity for metabolic adverse effects in the latter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bobo 2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casey, D (1999) &quot;Tardive dyskinesia and atypical antipsychotic drugs&quot; Schizophrenia Research, Volume 35, Supplement 1: S61-S66&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government organization NICE recently revised its recommendation favoring atypicals, to advise that the choice should be an individual one based on the particular profiles of the individual drug and on the patient's preferences.

The re-evaluation of the evidence has not necessarily slowed the bias towards prescribing the atypicals, however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.lww.com/practicalpsychiatry/Abstract/2010/01000/Biases_in_Medication_Prescribing__The_Case_of.3.aspx Biases in Medication Prescribing: The Case of Second-Generation Antipsychotics (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second generation antipsychotics===
{{Main|Atypical antipsychotic}}
* [[Clozapine]] (Clozaril) - Requires weekly to biweekly [[complete blood count]] due to risk of [[agranulocytosis]].
* [[Olanzapine]] (Zyprexa) - Used to treat psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute [[Mania|manic]] episodes, and maintenance of [[bipolar disorder]]. Dosing 2.5 to 20&amp;nbsp;mg per day.
* [[Risperidone]] (Risperdal) - Dosing 0.25 to 6&amp;nbsp;mg per day and is titrated upward; divided dosing is recommended until initial titration is completed, at which time the drug can be administered once daily.  Used off-label to treat [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[anxiety disorder]].
* [[Quetiapine]] (Seroquel) - Used primarily to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and &quot;off-label&quot; to treat chronic [[insomnia]] and [[restless legs syndrome]]; it is a powerful sedative. Dosing starts at 25&amp;nbsp;mg and continues up to 800&amp;nbsp;mg maximum per day, depending on the severity of the symptom(s) being treated.
* [[Ziprasidone]] (Geodon) - Approved in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to treat bipolar disorder. Dosing 20&amp;nbsp;mg twice daily initially up to 80&amp;nbsp;mg twice daily.  Side-effects include a prolonged [[QT interval]] in the heart, which can be dangerous for patients with [[heart disease]] or those taking other drugs that prolong the QT interval.
* [[Amisulpride]] (Solian) - Selective dopamine antagonist. Higher doses (greater than 400&amp;nbsp;mg) act upon post-synaptic dopamine receptors resulting in a reduction in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as psychosis. Lower doses, however, act upon dopamine autoreceptors, resulting in increased dopamine transmission, improving the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Lower doses of amisulpride have also been shown to have [[antidepressant]] and [[anxiolytic]] effects in non-schizophrenic patients, leading to its use in [[dysthymia]] and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]]s. Amisulpride has not been approved for use by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] in the United States.
* [[Asenapine]] (Saphris) is a 5-HT2A- and D2-receptor antagonist under development for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute mania associated with bipolar disorder.
* [[Paliperidone]] (Invega) - Derivative of risperidone that was approved in 2006.
* [[Iloperidone]] (Fanapt) - Approved by the FDA on May 6, 2009.
* [[Zotepine]] (Nipolept, Losizopilon, Lodopin, Setous)- An atypical antipsychotic indicated for acute and chronic schizophrenia. It was approved in Japan circa 1982 and Germany in 1990, respectively.
* [[Sertindole]] (Serdolect, and Serlect in Mexico). Sertindole was developed by the Danish pharmaceutical company [[H. Lundbeck]]. Like the other atypical antipsychotics, it is believed to have [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] activity at dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain.

===Third generation antipsychotics===
* [[Aripiprazole]] (Abilify) - Dosing 1&amp;nbsp;mg up to maximum of 30&amp;nbsp;mg has been used. Mechanism of action is thought to reduce susceptibility to metabolic symptoms seen in some other atypical antipsychotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Swainston Harrison T, Perry CM |title=Aripiprazole: a review of its use in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder |journal=Drugs |volume=64 |issue=15 |pages=1715–36 |year=2004 |pmid=15257633 |url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?issn=0012-6667&amp;volume=64&amp;issue=15&amp;spage=1715}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which these effects differ from other atypical antipsychotics is debated.&lt;ref name=&quot;AskAPatient&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Consumer Health Resource Group, LLC |date=2009-09-19 |title=Abilify Side Effects |publisher=www.askapatient.com |url=http://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=21436&amp;name=ABILIFY |accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Partial agonist]]s of dopamine.

===Other options===
* [[Cannabidiol]] is one of the main components of ''[[Cannabis sativa]]''. Cannabidiol differs from the active drug in cannabis, [[tetrahydrocannabinol]], in that cannabidiol lacks the typical intoxicating and recreational effects. One study has suggested that cannabidiol may be as effective as atypical antipsychotics in treating schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Zuardi AW, Crippa JA, Hallak JE, Moreira FA, Guimarães FS |title=Cannabidiol, a Cannabis sativa constituent, as an antipsychotic drug |journal=Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=421–9 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16612464 |doi=10.1590/S0100-879X2006000400001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some further research has supported these results, and found fewer side effects with cannabidiol than with [[amisulpride]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Leweke 2009 s207&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0924-9338(09)70440-7 |title=S39-02 Antipsychotic effects of cannabidiol |year=2009 |last1=Leweke |first1=F.M. |last2=Koethe |first2=D. |last3=Pahlisch |first3=F. |last4=Schreiber |first4=D. |last5=Gerth |first5=C.W. |last6=Nolden |first6=B.M. |last7=Klosterkötter |first7=J. |last8=Hellmich |first8=M. |last9=Piomelli |first9=D. |journal= European Psychiatry |volume=24 |pages=S207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leweke 2009 s207&quot;/&gt;
* [[Tetrabenazine]] is similar in function to antipsychotic drugs, though is not, in general, considered an antipsychotic itself. Its main usefulness is the treatment of hyperkinetic [[movement disorder]]s such as [[Huntington's disease]] and Tourette syndrome, rather than for conditions such as schizophrenia. Also, rather than having the potential to cause [[tardive dyskinesia]], which most antipsychotics have, tetrabenazine can be an effective treatment for the condition.
* [[Metabotropic glutamate receptor 2]] [[agonist|agonism]] has been seen as a promising strategy in the development of novel antipsychotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Benneyworth MA, Xiang Z, Smith RL, Garcia EE, Conn PJ, Sanders-Bush E |title=A selective positive allosteric modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2 blocks a hallucinogenic drug model of psychosis |journal=Molecular Pharmacology |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=477–84 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17526600 |doi=10.1124/mol.107.035170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Fell MJ, Svensson KA, Johnson BG, Schoepp DD |title=Evidence for the role of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu)2 not mGlu3 receptors in the preclinical antipsychotic pharmacology of the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist (-)-(1R,4S,5S,6S)-4-amino-2-sulfonylbicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-4,6-dicarboxylic acid (LY404039) |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume=326 |issue=1 |pages=209–17 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18424625 |doi=10.1124/jpet.108.136861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=González-Maeso J, Ang RL, Yuen T, et al. |title=Identification of a serotonin/glutamate receptor complex implicated in psychosis |journal=Nature |volume=452 |issue=7183 |pages=93–7 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid= 18297054 |pmc=2743172 |doi=10.1038/nature06612}}&lt;/ref&gt; When tested in patients, the research substance ''LY2140023'' yielded promising results and had few side effects.

* A placebo-controlled trial has suggested that adding [[L-theanine]], an [[amino acid]] found in green tea and available as supplement, to ongoing antipsychotic medication may be helpful in reducing some symptoms of schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;BfR&quot;&gt;{{cite | author=Egashira N, Ishigami N, Pu F, ''et al.'' |web|url=http://www.stanleyresearch.org/Trial/Drug/awardedtrialdetail.aspx?id=252|title=L-Theanine relieves positive, activation, and anxiety symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder: an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-center study, J Clin Psychiatry 2010;71:1-9.|publisher=Stanley Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
All antipsychotic drugs tend to block [[dopamine receptor|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]] in the [[dopamine]] pathways of the [[Human brain|brain]]. This means that dopamine released in these pathways has less effect. Excess release of dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] has been linked to psychotic experiences. It is the blockade of dopamine receptors in this pathway that is thought to control psychotic experiences.

Typical antipsychotics are not particularly selective and also block dopamine receptors in the [[mesocortical pathway]], [[tuberoinfundibular pathway]], and the [[nigrostriatal pathway]]. Blocking D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in these other pathways is thought to produce some of the unwanted [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] that the typical antipsychotics can produce (see above). They were commonly classified on a spectrum of low potency to high potency, where potency referred to the ability of the drug to bind to dopamine receptors, and not to the effectiveness of the drug. High-potency antipsychotics such as [[haloperidol]], in general, have doses of a few milligrams and cause less sleepiness and calming effects than low-potency antipsychotics such as [[chlorpromazine]] and [[thioridazine]], which have dosages of several hundred milligrams. The latter have a greater degree of anticholinergic and antihistaminergic activity, which can counteract dopamine-related side effects.

Atypical antipsychotic drugs have a similar blocking effect on D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Some also block or partially block [[serotonin]] receptors (particularly 5HT&lt;sub&gt;2A, C&lt;/sub&gt; and 5HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors):ranging from risperidone, which acts overwhelmingly on serotonin receptors, to amisulpride, which has no serotonergic activity. The additional effects on serotonin receptors may be why some of them can benefit the &quot;negative symptoms&quot; of schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Murphy BP, Chung YC, Park TW, McGorry PD |title= Pharmacological treatment of primary negative symptoms in schizophrenia: a systematic review |journal=Schizophrenia Research |volume=88 |issue=1-3 |pages=5–25 |year=2006 |month= December |pmid=16930948 |doi=10.1016/j.schres.2006.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural effects==
Many studies now indicate that chronic treatment with antipsychotics affects the brain at a structural level, for example increasing the volume of the [[basal ganglia]] (especially the [[caudate nucleus]]), and reducing cortical [[grey matter]] volume in different brain areas. The effects may differ for typical versus atypical antipsychotics and may interact with different stages of disorders.&lt;ref name=Vita2007&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Vita A, De Peri L |title=The effects of antipsychotic treatment on cerebral structure and function in schizophrenia |journal=International Review of Psychiatry |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=429–36 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17671875 |doi=10.1080/09540260701486332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Beng-Choon Ho, MRCPsych; Nancy C.

==Controversy==
According to [[The Guardian]] newspaper: &quot;At the heart of years of dissent against psychiatry through the ages has been its use of drugs, particularly antipsychotics, to treat distress. Do such drugs actually target any &quot;psychiatric condition&quot;? Or are they chemical control—a socially-useful reduction of the paranoid, deluded, distressed, bizarre and odd into semi-vegetative zombies?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/mar/02/mythoftheantipsychotic Myth of the antipsychotic]&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of this class of drugs has a history of criticism in residential care. As the drugs used can make patients calmer and more compliant, critics claim that the drugs can be overused. Outside doctors can feel under pressure from care home staff.&lt;ref&gt;''GPs under 'pressure' to issue neuroleptics, claims professor'', Chemist + Druggist, 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In an official review commissioned by UK government ministers it was reported that the needless use of anti-psychotic medication in dementia care was widespread and was linked to 1800 deaths per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8356423.stm NEWS.BBC.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssHealthcareNews/idUSLC44347420091112 Reuters.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the government has initiated legal action against the pharmaceutical company [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] for allegedly paying kickbacks to [[Omnicare]] to promote its antipsychotic [[Risperidone]] (Risperdal) in nursing homes.&lt;ref name=Hilzenrath&gt;{{Cite news|author=Hilzenrath, David S. |date=January 16, 2010 |title=Justice suit accuses Johnson &amp; Johnson of paying kickbacks |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011503903.html |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate= January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some controversy over maintenance therapy for schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moncrieff-2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jobe2005&quot;/&gt; A review of studies about maintenance therapy concluded that long-term antipsychotic treatment was superior to placebo in reducing relapse in individuals with schizophrenia, although some of the studies were small.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kane-2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kane | first1 = JM. | last2 = Leucht | first2 = S. | title = Unanswered questions in schizophrenia clinical trials. | journal = Schizophr Bull | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 302–9 | month = Mar | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbm143 | pmc = 2632396 | pmid = 18199633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of major [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] in North America found that a moderate number of patients with schizophrenia were seen to recover over time from their symptoms, raising the possibility that some patients may not require maintenance medication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jobe2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jobe TH, Harrow M |title=Long-term outcome of patients with schizophrenia: a review |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=14 |pages=892–900 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16494258 |url=http://ww1.cpa-apc.org/Publications/Archives/CJP/2005/december/cjp-dec-05-Harrow-IR.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that much of the research into long-term antipsychotic maintenance may be flawed due to failure to take into account the role of antipsychotic withdrawal effects on relapse rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moncrieff-2006&quot;/&gt;

There has also been controversy about the role of [[pharmaceutical]] companies in [[marketing]] and promoting antipsychotics, including allegations of downplaying or covering up adverse effects, expanding the number of conditions or illegally promoting off-label usage; influencing drug trials (or their publication) to try to show that the expensive and profitable newer atypicals were superior to the older cheaper typicals that were out of patent. For example in the US, [[Eli Lilly and Company]] recently pleaded guilty to violating US laws for over a decade in regard to [[Zyprexa]] (olanzapine), and was ordered to pay $1.42&amp;nbsp;billion to settle criminal and civil allegations, including the biggest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in US history; while [[Astrazeneca]] is facing about 9,000 personal-injury lawsuits from more than 15,000 former users of [[Seroquel]] (quetiapine), amidst federal investigations of its marketing practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/business/28drug.html Drug Maker’s E-Mail Released in Seroquel Lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt; By expanding the conditions for which they were indicated, Astrazeneca's Seroquel and Eli Lilly's Zyprexa had become the biggest selling antipsychotics in 2008 with global sales of $5.5&amp;nbsp;billion and $5.4&amp;nbsp;billion respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;healthcarefinancenews.com&quot;/&gt;

Some critics have also analyzed the use of alleged front organizations and conflicted patient &quot;advocacy&quot; groups funded by pharmaceutical companies that seek to set the mental health agenda, including the use of the law to force people to take antipsychotics against their will, often justified by claims about risk of violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/pharm-agenda.html Pharmaceutical Industry Agenda Setting in Mental Health Policies]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archduke Charles of Austria, Duke of Teschen''' ([[German language|de]]: ''Erzherzog Karl von Österreich, Herzog von Teschen'', also known as ''Karl von Österreich-Teschen'') (Full name: Karl Ludwig Johann Josef Lorenz of Austria) (5 September 1771 &amp;ndash; 30 April 1847) was an [[Austria]]n field-marshal, the third son of emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] and his wife [[Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain]]. He was also the younger brother of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Despite being [[epilepsy|epileptic]], Charles achieved respect both as a commander and as a reformer of the Austrian army. He was considered one of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon's]] most formidable opponents.

He began his career fighting the revolutionary armies of France.  Early in the wars of the [[First Coalition]], he saw victory at [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Neerwinden]] in 1793, before tasting defeat at [[Battle of Wattignies|Wattignies]] 1793 and [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] 1794. In 1796, as chief of all Austrian forces on the Rhine, Charles out-generaled [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] at [[Battle of Amberg|Amberg]] and [[Battle of Würzburg|Würzburg]], and forced [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau]] to withdraw across the Rhine, and followed these victories with others at [[First Battle of Zürich|Zürich]], [[Battle of Ostrach|Ostrach]], [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach]], and [[Battle of Messkirch|Messkirch]] in 1799. He reformed Austria's armies to adopt the nation at arms principle; in 1809, he went into the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]] with confidence and inflicted Napoleon's first major setback at [[Battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern-Essling]], before suffering a massive defeat at the [[Battle of Wagram]]. Following Wagram, Charles saw no more significant action in the Napoleonic Wars.

As a military strategist, historians compare him to [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], conservative, cautious, and competent. Charles was a study in contrasts.  As a practitioner, he was flawless in executing complex and risky maneuvers of troops in the heat of battle, achieving brilliant victories in the face of almost certain defeat. Yet, as a theoretician, his devotion to ground and caution led his contemporary, [[Carl von Clausewitz]], to criticize his rigidity and adherence to geographic strategy.  Regardless, he remains among Austria's pantheon of heroes of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.

==Youth and early career==
Charles was born in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], where his father was then Grand Duke. In a generous act by his father, he was adopted and raised in Vienna by his childless aunt [[Archduchess Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen|Archduchess Marie Christine of Austria]] and her husband [[Albert of Saxe-Teschen]]. His youth was spent in [[Tuscany]], at [[Vienna]] and in the Austrian Netherlands, where he began his career of military service in the war of the [[French Revolution]]. He commanded a brigade at the [[Battle of Jemappes]], and in the campaign of 1793 distinguished himself at the [[Battle of Aldenhoven (1794)|Action of Aldenhoven]] and the [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|Battle of Neerwinden]].  In this year he became ''Statthalter'' in [[Belgium]] and received the army rank of lieutenant field marshal. This promotion was soon followed by that to ''Feldzeugmeister''. In the remainder of the war in the [[Low Countries]] he held high commands, and was present at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]].

In 1795 he served on the Rhine, and in the following year was entrusted with chief control of all the Austrian forces on that river. His conduct of the operations against [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]] and [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]] in 1796 marked him out at once as one of the greatest generals in Europe. At first falling back carefully and avoiding a decision, he finally marched away, leaving a mere screen in front of Moreau. Falling upon Jourdan he beat him in the battles of [[Battle of Amberg|Amberg]] and [[Battle of Würzburg|Würzburg]], and drove him over the Rhine with great loss. He then turned upon Moreau's army, which he defeated and forced out of Germany.

==Napoleonic Wars==

{{See also|Imperial and Royal Army during the Napoleonic Wars}}

In 1797 he was sent to arrest the victorious march of [[Napoleon I of France|General Bonaparte]] in [[Italy]], and he conducted the retreat of the over-matched Austrians with the highest skill. In the campaign of 1799 he once more opposed [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan|Jourdan]], whom he defeated in the battles of [[Battle of Ostrach|Ostrach]] and [[Battle of Stockach (1799)|Stockach]], following up his success by invading [[Switzerland]] and defeating [[André Masséna|Masséna]] in the [[First Battle of Zürich]], after which he re-entered Germany and drove the French once more over the Rhine.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther E. Rothenberg, ''Napoleon’s Great Adversary:Archduke Charles and the Austrian Army 1792–1914'', Spellmount, Stroud, (Gloucester), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ill-health, however, forced him to retire to [[Bohemia]], but he was soon recalled to undertake the task of checking Moreau's advance on Vienna. The result of the [[Battle of Hohenlinden]] had, however, foredoomed the attempt, and the archduke had to make the armistice of [[Steyr]]. His popularity was now such that the diet of Regensburg, which met in 1802, resolved to erect a statue in his honor and to give him the title of savior of his country, but Charles refused both distinctions.

In the short and disastrous war of 1805 Archduke Charles commanded what was intended to be the main army in Italy, but events made Germany the decisive theatre of operations; Austria sustained defeat on the [[Danube]], and the archduke was defeated by Massena in the [[Battle of Caldiero (1805)|Battle of Caldiero]]. With the conclusion of peace he began his active work of army reorganization, which was first tested on the field in 1809. As ''generalissimo'' of the army he had been made [[Generalfeldmarschall|field marshal]] some years before.

In 1806 Francis II (now Francis I of Austria) named the Archduke Charles Commander in Chief of the Austrian army as well as Head of the Council of War. Supported by the prestige of being the only general who had proved capable of defeating the French, he promptly initiated a far-reaching scheme of reform, which replaced the obsolete methods of the 18th century. The chief characteristics of the new order were the adoption of the nation in arms principle and the adoption of French war organization and tactics. The army reforms were not yet completed by the war of 1809, in which Charles acted as commander in chief, yet even so it proved a far more formidable opponent than the old and was only defeated after a desperate struggle involving Austrian victories and large loss of life on both sides.

Its initial successes were neutralized by the reverses of [[Battle of Abensberg|Abensberg]], [[Battle of Landshut (1809)|Landshut]] and [[Battle of Eckmuhl|Eckmuhl]] but, after the evacuation of Vienna, the archduke won a strong victory at the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] but soon afterwards lost decisively at the [[Battle of Wagram]]. At the end of the campaign the archduke gave up all his military offices.

==Later life==
[[Image:Karl AustriaTeschen Henriette NassauWeilburg.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Archduke Charles with family.]]

When Austria joined the ranks of the allies during the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], Charles was not given a command and the post of commander-in-chief of the allied Grand Army of Bohemia went to the [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Prince of Schwarzenberg]]. Charles spent the rest of his life in retirement, except for a short time in 1815 when he was military governor of the [[Fortress Mainz]]. In 1822 he succeeded to the duchy of Saxe-Teschen.

On 15 September/17 September 1815 in [[Weilburg]], Charles married Princess [[Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg]] (1797&amp;ndash;1829). She was a daughter of [[Frederick William of Nassau-Weilburg]] (1768–1816) and his wife [[Burgravine Louise Isabelle of Kirchberg]].

Frederick William was the eldest surviving son of [[Karl Christian of Nassau-Weilburg]] and [[Princess Wilhelmine Carolina of Orange-Nassau]].

Wilhelmine Carolina was a daughter of [[William IV, Prince of Orange]] and [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange]]. Anne was in turn the eldest daughter of [[George II of Great Britain]] and [[Caroline of Ansbach]].

Charles died at [[Vienna]] on 30 April 1847. He is buried in tomb 122 in the [[Imperial Crypt Vaults#The New Vault|New Vault]] of the [[Imperial Crypt]] in Vienna. An equestrian statue was erected to his memory on the [[Heldenplatz]] in Vienna in 1860.

==Assessment of his achievements==
The caution which the [[archduke]] preached so earnestly in his strategic works, he displayed in practice only when the situation seemed to demand it, though his education certainly prejudiced him in favor of the defensive at all costs. He was at the same time capable of forming and executing the most daring offensive strategy, and his tactical skill in the handling of troops, whether in wide turning movements, as at Würzburg and Zürich, or in masses, as at Aspern and Wagram, was certainly equal to that of any leader of his time, with only a few exceptions.

[[Image:Archduke Charles at Battle of Ostrach.JPG|left|thumb|230px|Archduke Charles at the Battle of Ostrach]]
His [[military campaign|campaign]] of 1796 is considered almost faultless. That he sustained defeat in 1809 was due in part to the great numerical superiority of the French and their allies, and in part to the condition of his newly reorganized troops. His six weeks' inaction after the victory of Aspern is, however, open to unfavorable criticism. As a military writer, his position in the evolution of the art of war is very important, and his doctrines had naturally the greatest weight. Nevertheless they cannot but be considered antiquated even in 1806. Caution and the importance of strategic points are the chief features of his system. The rigidity of his [[geography|geographical]] strategy may be gathered from the prescription that this principle is never to be departed from.

Again and again he repeats the advice that nothing should be hazarded unless one's army is completely secure, a rule which he himself neglected with such brilliant results in 1796. Strategic points, he says, not the defeat of the enemy's army, decide the fate of one's own country, and must constantly remain the general's main concern, a [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] which was never more remarkably disproved than in the war of 1809. The editor of the archduke's work is able to make but a feeble defense against [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz's]] reproach that Charles attached more value to ground than to the annihilation of the foe. In his tactical writings the same spirit is conspicuous. His reserve in battle is designed to cover a retreat.

[[Image:Archduke Charles Statue.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Statue of Archduke Charles on the [[Heldenplatz]] in [[Vienna]].]]

The baneful influence of these antiquated principles was clearly shown in the maintenance of [[Battle of Königgratz|Königgratz-Josefstadt]] in 1866 as a strategic point, which was preferred to the defeat of the separated Prussian armies, and in the strange plans produced in Vienna for the campaign of 1859, and in the almost unintelligible [[Battle of Montebello (1859)|Battle of Montebello]] in the same year. The theory and the practice of Archduke Charles form one of the most curious contrasts in military history. In the one he is unreal, in the other he displayed, along with the greatest skill, a vivid activity which made him for long the most formidable opponent of Napoleon.

On the battlefield, it is probably fair to say, Charles was comparable in skill and style to Sir [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] - quite conservative and yet exceedingly competent. Wellington is better-known to posterity, because he led one of the two Allied armies at the final decisive victory of the Napoleonic Wars (the battle of Waterloo in 1815), although Wellington's superior reputation is perhaps also because he only once faced Napoleon, whereas Charles was confronted by Napoleon in battle more times than any other commander. On these occasions the reliable and yet unimaginative tactics Charles was fond of were not sufficient, except on one occasion at Aspern-Essling, to defeat the unpredictable [[Corsica]]n. Nonetheless Charles is a member of a [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of famous Napoleonic figures that includes the Emperor himself, [[Louis Nicolas Davout]], [[Andre Massena]], [[Karl Philipp Fürst zu Schwarzenberg|Karl von Schwarzenberg]], [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher]] and the aforementioned Duke of Wellington.

He was the 831st [[Knight]] of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in [[Austria]].

'''Augustine of Canterbury''' (''[[circa]]'' first third of the 6th century – probably 26 May 604) was a [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] who became the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in the year 598. He is considered the &quot;Apostle to the English&quot; and a founder of the English Church.&lt;ref name=DictSaint&gt;Delaney ''Dictionary of Saints'' pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine was the [[prior]] of a monastery in Rome when Pope [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] chose him in 595 to lead a mission, usually known as the [[Gregorian mission]], to Britain to [[Christianization|Christianize]] the King [[Æthelberht of Kent|Æthelberht]] of the [[Kingdom of Kent]] from his native [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]]. In a letter to the patriarch of Alexandria detailing early successes of the mission, Gregory wrote of having sent Augustine and his companions &quot;to the ends of the earth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory ''Epistolae'' viii.29&lt;/ref&gt; Kent was probably chosen because it was near the Christian kingdoms in [[Gaul]] and because Æthelberht had married a Christian princess, [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], daughter of [[Charibert I]] the [[List of Frankish kings|King of Paris]] who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. Before reaching Kent the missionaries had considered turning back but Gregory urged them on and, in 597, Augustine landed on the [[Isle of Thanet]] and proceeded to Æthelberht's main town of [[Canterbury]].

King Æthelberht converted to Christianity and allowed the missionaries to preach freely, giving them land to found a monastery outside the city walls. Augustine was consecrated bishop of the English and converted many of the king's subjects, including thousands during a mass baptism on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] in 597. Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601, along with encouraging letters and gifts for the churches, although attempts to persuade the native [[Celts|Celtic]] bishops to submit to Augustine's authority failed. Roman bishops were established at London and Rochester in 604, and a school was founded to train [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] priests and missionaries. Augustine also arranged the consecration of his successor, [[Laurence of Canterbury]]. The archbishop probably died in 604 and was soon revered as a [[saint]].

==Background to the mission==
After the withdrawal of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman legion|legions]] from the province of Britannia in 410, the natives of the province were left to defend themselves against the attacks of the Saxons. Before the withdrawal Britannia had been converted to Christianity and had even produced its own heretic in [[Pelagius]].&lt;ref name=Hindley3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayr78/&gt; Britain sent three bishops to the [[Council of Arles]] in 314, and a Gaulish bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters.&lt;ref name=Frend80&gt;Frend &quot;Roman Britain&quot; ''Cross Goes North'' pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; Material remains testify to a growing presence of Christians, at least until around 360.&lt;ref name=Frend82&gt;Frend &quot;Roman Britain&quot; ''Cross Goes North'' pp. 82–86&lt;/ref&gt; After the legions left, pagan tribes settled the southern parts of the island, but western Britain, beyond the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, remained Christian. This native [[Celtic Christianity|British Church]] developed in isolation from Rome under the influence of missionaries from Ireland&lt;ref name=Hindley3&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 3–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayr78/&gt; and was centred on monasteries instead of bishoprics. Other distinguishing characteristics were its calculation of the date of [[Easter]] and the style of the [[tonsure]] haircut that clerics wore.&lt;ref name=Mayr78&gt;Mayr-Harting ''The Coming of Christianity'' pp. 78–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yorke115&gt;Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' pp. 115–118 discusses the issue of the &quot;Celtic Church&quot; and what exactly it was.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the survival of Christianity in the eastern part of Britain during this time includes the survival of the cult of [[Saint Alban]] and the occurrence in place names of ''eccles'', derived from the Latin ''ecclesia'', meaning &quot;church&quot;.&lt;ref name=Yorke121&gt;Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that these native Christians tried to convert the Anglo-Saxons.&lt;ref name=ASE102&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harting32&gt;Mayr-Harting ''The Coming of Christianity'' pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; The invasions destroyed most remnants of Roman civilization in the areas held by the Saxons and related tribes, including the economic and religious structures.&lt;ref name=Kirby23&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

It was against this background that Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission, often called the Gregorian mission, to convert the [[Anglo-Saxons]] to Christianity in 595.&lt;ref name=ASE104&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;Jones &quot;Gregorian Mission&quot; ''Speculum''&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of Kent was ruled by Æthelberht, who had married a Christian princess named [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]] before 588,&lt;ref name=ASE105&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps earlier than 560.&lt;ref name=Kirby24&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Bertha was the daughter of [[Charibert I]], one of the [[Merovingian]] kings of the [[Franks]]. As one of the conditions of her marriage she had brought a bishop named [[Liudhard]] with her to Kent.&lt;ref name=DNBBertha&gt;Nelson &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2269 Bertha (b. c.565, d. in or after 601)]&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; Together in Canterbury, they restored a church that dated to Roman times&lt;ref name=Hindley33&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 33–36&lt;/ref&gt;—possibly the current [[St Martin's Church, Canterbury]]. Æthelberht was a [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan]] at this point but allowed his wife freedom of worship. One biographer of Bertha states that under his wife's influence, Æthelberht asked Pope Gregory to send missionaries.&lt;ref name=DNBBertha/&gt; The historian Ian Wood feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen.&lt;ref name=Wood10&gt;Wood &quot;Mission of Augustine of Canterbury&quot; ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'' pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians, however, believe that Gregory initiated the mission, although the exact reasons remain unclear. [[Bede]], an 8th-century monk who wrote a history of the English church, recorded a famous story in which Gregory saw fair-haired Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people.{{#tag:ref|Supposedly Gregory inquired about who the slaves were. He was told they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels.&lt;ref&gt;Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}}&lt;ref name=Harting57&gt;Mayr-Harting ''The Coming of Christianity'' pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt; More practical matters, such as the acquisition of new provinces acknowledging the primacy of the papacy, and a desire to influence the emerging power of the Kentish kingdom under Æthelberht, were probably involved.&lt;ref name=Hindley33/&gt; The mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the [[Lombards]].&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Mayr-Harting &quot;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/899 Augustine [St Augustine] (d. 604)]&quot; ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from Æthelberht's granting of freedom of worship to his wife, the choice of Kent was probably dictated by a number of other factors. Kent was proving to be the dominant power in south-eastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King [[Ceawlin of Wessex]] in 592, Æthelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; [[Bede]] refers to Æthelberht as having [[imperium]] (overlordship) south of the [[Humber|River Humber]]. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established, and the [[language barrier]] between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area.&lt;ref name=Brooks6&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence was not merely political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well.&lt;ref name=Kirby27&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, who was the prior of the [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio|Abbey of St Andrew's]] in Rome, to head the mission to Kent.&lt;ref name=ASE104/&gt; The pope selected monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish royalty and clergy in a series of letters, of which some copies survive in Rome. He wrote to King [[Theuderic II]] of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and to King [[Theudebert II]] of [[Austrasia]], as well as their grandmother [[Brunhilda of Austrasia|Brunhild]], seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King [[Chlothar II]] of [[Neustria]] for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and Frankish priests to accompany the mission.&lt;ref name=Brooks4&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to assure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as Æthelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission who visibly had the support of his wife's relatives and people.&lt;ref name=Brooks6&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Franks appreciated the chance to participate in mission that would extend their influence in Kent. Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.&lt;ref name=Wood9&gt;Wood &quot;Mission of Augustine of Canterbury&quot; ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources make no mention of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission. Pope Gregory once wrote to Æthelberht complimenting Augustine's knowledge of the [[Bible]], so Augustine was evidently well educated. Other qualifications included administrative ability, for Gregory was the abbot of St Andrews as well as being pope, which left the day-to-day running of the abbey to Augustine, the prior.&lt;ref name=Fletcher116&gt;Fletcher ''The Barbarian Conversion'' pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrival and first efforts==

Augustine was accompanied by [[Laurence of Canterbury]], his eventual successor to the [[archbishop]]ric, and a group of about 40 companions, some of whom were monks.&lt;ref name=ASE105/&gt; Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted by the nature of the task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return. Gregory refused and sent Augustine back with letters encouraging the missionaries to persevere.&lt;ref name=Blair116&gt;Blair ''An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; In 597, Augustine and his companions landed in Kent.&lt;ref name=ASE105/&gt; They achieved some initial success soon after their arrival:&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fletcher116&quot;/&gt; Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of [[Canterbury]] where they used the church of St Martin's for services.&lt;ref name=Brooks8/&gt; Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht's conversion,&lt;ref name=Woods11&gt;Wood &quot;Mission of Augustine of Canterbury&quot; ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'' p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; but it probably took place in 597.&lt;ref name=Brooks8/&gt;{{#tag:ref|However, Bede's chronology may be a bit off, as he gives the king's death as occurring in February 616, and says the king died 21 years after his conversion, which would date the conversion to 595. This would be before Augustine's mission, and directly contradicts Bede's statement that the king's conversion was due to Augustine's mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby24&quot;/&gt; However, as Gregory in his letter of 601 to the king and queen strongly implies that the queen was unable to effect the conversion of her husband, the problem of the dating is likely a chronological error on Bede's part.&lt;ref name=Kirby28/&gt;|group=notes}} In the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] period, large scale conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and Augustine is recorded as making large numbers of converts within a year of his arrival in Kent.&lt;ref name=Brooks8/&gt; Also, by 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism.{{#tag:ref|The letter, as translated in Brooks' ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'', p. 8, says &quot;preserve the grace he had received&quot;. ''Grace'' in this context meant the grace of baptism.|group=notes}} A [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler [[Thomas Elmham]], gives the date of the king's conversion as [[Pentecost|Whit Sunday]], or 2 June 597; there is no reason to doubt this date, although there is no other evidence for it.&lt;ref name=Brooks8&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Against a date in 597 is a letter of Gregory's to Patriarch [[Eulogius of Alexandria]] in June 598, which mentions the number of converts made by Augustine, but does not mention any baptism of the king. However, it is clear that by 601 the king had been converted.&lt;ref name=Kirby28&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; His baptism likely took place at Canterbury.&lt;ref name=Convert56&gt;Higham ''Convert Kings'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine established his [[episcopal see]] at Canterbury.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; It is not clear when and where Augustine was consecrated as a bishop. Bede, writing about a century later, states that Augustine was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop Ætherius of [[Arles]] after the conversion of Æthelberht. Contemporary letters from Pope Gregory, however, refer to Augustine as a bishop before he arrived in England. A letter of Gregory's from September 597 calls Augustine a bishop, and one ten months later says that Augustine had been consecrated on Gregory's command by bishops of the German lands.&lt;ref name=Brooks5&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The historian R. A. Markus discusses the various theories of when and where Augustine was consecrated, and suggests that he was consecrated before arriving in England, but argues that the evidence does not permit deciding exactly where this took place.&lt;ref name=Markus24&gt;Markus &quot;Chronology of the Gregorian Mission&quot; ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' pp. 24–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his arrival, Augustine founded the [[monastery]] of Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], which later became [[St Augustine's Abbey]],&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; on land donated by the king.&lt;ref name=Blair61&gt;Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; This foundation has often been claimed as the first [[Benedictine]] abbey outside Italy, and that by founding it Augustine introduced the [[Rule of St. Benedict]] into England, but there is no evidence that the abbey followed the Benedictine Rule at the time of its foundation.&lt;ref name=Monasticism55&gt;Lawrence ''Medieval Monasticism'' p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter Gregory wrote to the [[patriarch of Alexandria]] in 598, he claimed that more than 10,000 Christians had been baptised; the number may be exaggerated but there is no reason to doubt that a mass conversion took place.&lt;ref name=ASE105/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fletcher116/&gt; However, there were probably some Christians already in Kent before Augustine arrived, remnants of the Christians who lived in Britain in the later Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harting32&quot;/&gt; Little literary traces remain of them, however.&lt;ref name=Frend79&gt;Frend &quot;Roman Britain&quot; ''Cross Goes North'' p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; One other effect of the king's conversion by Augustine's mission was that the Frankish influence on the southern kingdoms of Britain was decreased.&lt;ref name=Kirby29&gt;Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with a report of his success along with questions about the mission.&lt;ref name=ASE106&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]'', this section of the ''History'' is usually known as the ''[[Libellus responsionum]]''.&lt;ref name=Laurentius&gt;Lapidge &quot;Laurentius&quot; ''Blackwell Enclyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bede71/&gt; Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.&lt;ref name=Bede71&gt;Bede ''A History of the English Church'' pp. 71–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Further missionaries were sent from Rome in 601. They brought a [[pallium]] for Augustine and a present of sacred vessels, [[vestment]]s, [[relic]]s, and books.{{#tag:ref|What happened to these items in later years is unknown. [[Thomas Elmham]], a 15th century chronicler at Canterbury, gave a number of theories of how most of these objects were lost, including being hidden and never recovered during the Danish attacks in the 9th and 10th centuries, hidden and lost after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066 or used for the ransom of King [[Richard I of England]] in th 1190s.&lt;ref name=Dodwell10&gt;Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving [[St Augustine Gospels]], ([[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] manuscript (MS) 286) which is a 6th-century Italian illuminated [[Gospel Book]],  may be one of the works sent to Augustine. Traditionally, it has been associated with the [[Gregorian mission]].&lt;ref name=Dodwell96&gt;Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' pp. 96 and 276 footnote 66&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible survivor is a copy of the ''[[Rule of St Benedict]]'', now MS Oxford [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] Hatton 48.&lt;ref name=Colgrave27&gt;Colgrave &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Earliest Life of Gregory the Great'' pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another possible survival is a Gospel, in an Italian hand, and closely related to the Augustine Gospels, now MS Oxford Bodelian Auctarium  D.2.14, which shows evidence of being held in Anglo-Saxon hands during the right time frame. Lastly, a fragment of a work by Gregory the Great, now held by the [[British Library]] as part of  MS [[Cotton library|Cotton]] Titus C may have arrived with the missionaries.&lt;ref name=Library24&gt;Lapidge ''Anglo-Saxon Library'' pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} The pallium was the symbol of [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] status, and signified that Augustine was now an archbishop. Along with the pallium, a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to ordain 12 [[suffragan bishop]]s as soon as possible and to send a bishop to [[York]]. Gregory's plan was that there would be two metropolitans, one at York and one at [[London]], with 12 suffragan bishops under each archbishop. As part of this plan, Augustine was expected to transfer his archiepiscopal see to London from Canterbury. The move from Canterbury to London never happened; no contemporary sources give the reason,&lt;ref name=Brooks9&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt; but it was probably because London was not part of Æthelberht's domains. Instead, London was part of the [[kingdom of Essex]], ruled by Æthelberht's nephew [[Saebert of Essex]], who converted to Christianity in 604.&lt;ref name=Hindley33/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fletcher453&gt;Fletcher ''The Barbarian Conversion'' p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see was indeed moved to London, and that it was only with the abandonment of London as a see after the death of Æthelberht that Canterbury became the archiepiscopal see. This theory contradicts Bede's version of events, however.&lt;ref name=Brooks11&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 11–14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 604, Augustine founded two more bishoprics in Britain. Two men who had come to Britain with him in 601 were consecrated, [[Mellitus]] as [[Bishop of London]] and [[Justus]] as [[Bishop of Rochester]].&lt;ref name=Hindley33/&gt;&lt;ref name=BEASE267&gt;Hayward &quot;St Justus&quot; ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 267–268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BEASE305&gt;Lapidge &quot;St Mellitus&quot; ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 305–306&lt;/ref&gt; Bede relates that Augustine, with the help of the king, &quot;recovered&quot; a church built by Roman Christians in Canterbury.&lt;ref name=Brooks50/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The actual Latin is from Chapter 33, Book 1 of Bede, and an online version is [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml#33 here]. The sentence in question is &quot;AT Augustinus, ubi in regia ciuitate sedem episcopalem, ut praediximus, accepit, recuperauit in ea, regio fultus adminiculo, ecclesiam, quam inibi antiquo Romanorum fidelium opere factam fuisse didicerat, et eam in nomine sancti Saluatoris Dei et Domini nostri Iesu Christi sacrauit, atque ibidem sibi habitationem statuit et cunctis successoribus suis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml#33|title= Historiam Ecclesiasticam Gentis Anglorum: Liber Primus |accessdate=1 April 2008|work= The Latin Library |publisher=Ad Fontes Academy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word ''recuperauit'' could be translated either &quot;repaired&quot; or &quot;recovered&quot;. Sherley-Price translates the sentence as &quot;Having been granted his episcopal see in the royal capital, as already recorded, Augustine proceeded with the king's help to repair a church he was informed had been built long ago by Roman Christians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} It is not clear if Bede meant that Augustine rebuilt the church or that Augustine merely reconsecrated a building that had been used for pagan worship. Archaeological evidence seems to support the latter interpretation; in 1973 the remains of an aisled building dating from the [[Romano-British]] period were uncovered just south of the present [[Canterbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=Brooks50&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Ian Wood argues that the existence of the ''Libellus'' points to more contact between Augustine and the native Christians because the topics covered in the work are not restricted to conversion from paganism, but also dealt with relations between differing styles of Christianity.&lt;ref name=Wood170&gt;Wood &quot;Augustine and Aidan&quot; ''L'Église et la Mission'' p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine failed to extend his authority to the Christians in [[Wales]] and [[Dumnonia]] to the west. Gregory had decreed that these Christians should submit to Augustine and that their bishops should obey him,&lt;ref name=Harting70&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 70–72&lt;/ref&gt; apparently believing that more of the Roman governmental and ecclesiastical organization survived in the Britain than was actually the case.&lt;ref name=Conversion118&gt;Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; According to the narrative of Bede, the Britons in these regions viewed Augustine with uncertainty, and their suspicion was compounded by a diplomatic misjudgement on Augustine's part.&lt;ref name=ASE110&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; In 603, Augustine and Æthelberht summoned the British bishops to a meeting. These guests retired early to confer with their people,&lt;ref name=Hindley8/&gt; who, according to Bede, advised them to judge Augustine based upon the respect he displayed at their next meeting. When Augustine failed to rise from his seat on the entrance of the British bishops,&lt;ref name=Bede100&gt;Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 100–103&lt;/ref&gt; they refused to recognise him as archbishop.&lt;ref name=Hindley8&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harting72/&gt; There were, however, deep differences between Augustine and the British church that perhaps played a more significant role in preventing an agreement. At issue were the [[tonsure]], the observance of [[Easter]], and practical and deep-rooted differences in approach to asceticism, missionary endeavours, and how the church itself was organised.&lt;ref name=ASE110/&gt; Some historians believe that Augustine had no real understanding of the history and traditions of the British church, damaging his relations with their bishops.&lt;ref name=Harting72&gt;Mayr-Harting '' Coming of Christianity'' pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there were political dimensions involved, as Augustine's efforts were sponsored by the Kentish king, and at this period the Wessex and Mercian kingdoms were expanding to the west, into areas held by the Britons.&lt;ref name=Conversion119&gt;Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further success==
Easier to implement were Rome's mandates concerning pagan temples and celebrations. Temples were to be consecrated for Christian use,&lt;ref name=Thomson8&gt;Thomson ''Western Church'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and feasts, if possible, moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers were unaware of details of the martyr's life or death. They may have been native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman [[Pope Sixtus II|St Sixtus]].&lt;ref name=Blair24&gt;Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory legislated on the behaviour of the laity and the clergy. He placed the new mission directly under papal authority and made it clear that English bishops would have no authority over Frankish counterparts nor vice versa. Other directives dealt with the training of native clergy and the missionaries' conduct.&lt;ref name=ASE107&gt;Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The King's School, Canterbury]] claims Augustine as its founder, which would make it the world's oldest existing school, but the first documentary records of the school date from the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kings-school.co.uk/document_1.aspx?id=1:31887&amp;id=1:31658&amp;id=1:31637 |title= 597 and all that: A Brief History of the King’s School, Canterbury |accessdate=2008-03-31 |publisher=The King's School, Canterbury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the [[East Anglia]]n mission.&lt;ref name=Brooks94&gt;Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine received [[liturgical book]]s from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They may have been some of the new mass books that were being written at this time. The exact liturgy that Augustine introduced to England remains unknown, but it would have been a form of the [[Latin]] language liturgy in use at Rome.&lt;ref name=Harting173&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:AgCant-tomb.jpg|thumb|left|Augustine's gravesite at Canterbury|alt=Pile of stones marked with a tag reading &quot;St. Augustine, Site of Grave, First Archbishop of Canterbury]]
Before his death, Augustine consecrated Laurence as his successor to the archbishopric, probably to ensure an orderly transfer of office.&lt;ref name=Hindley43&gt;Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Although at the time of Augustine's death, 26 May 604,&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; the mission barely extended beyond Kent, his undertaking introduced a more active missionary style into the British Isles. Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales, no efforts had been made to try to convert the Saxon invaders. Augustine was sent to convert the descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the decisive influence in Christianity in the British Isles.&lt;ref name=ASE110/&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins185&gt;Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his success came about because of Augustine's close relationship with Æthelberht, which gave the archbishop time to establish himself.&lt;ref name=Harting249&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.&lt;ref name=Harting264&gt;Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 265–266&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wood8&gt;Wood &quot;Mission of Augustine of Canterbury&quot; ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'' p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine's body was originally buried in the portico of what is now St Augustine's, Canterbury,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair61&quot;/&gt; but it was later exhumed and placed in a tomb within the abbey church, which became a place of pilgrimage and veneration. After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] the cult of St Augustine was actively promoted.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; After the Conquest, his [[shrine]] in St Augustine's Abbey held a central position in one of the axial chapels, flanked by the shrines of his successors Laurence and [[Mellitus]].&lt;ref name=Nilson67&gt;Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Henry I of England]] granted St. Augustine's Abbey a six day [[fair]] around the date on which Augustine's relics were [[Translation (relics)|translated]] to his new shrine, from 8 September through 13 September.&lt;ref name=Shrines&gt;Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

A life of Augustine was written by [[Goscelin]] around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a different light than Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches.&lt;ref name=Gameson17&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt; Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful.&lt;ref name=Gameson19&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; These authors included [[William of Malmesbury]], who claimed that Augustine founded [[Cerne Abbey]],&lt;ref name=Gameson20&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; the author (generally believed to be [[John Brompton]]) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine,&lt;ref name=Gameson24&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their [[Romance (genre)|romances]].&lt;ref name=Gameson22&gt;Gameson and Gameson &quot;From Augustine to Parker&quot; ''Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 22–31&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and [[Augustine of Hippo]], a 4th century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies  feature Augustine of Canterbury quite often, however.&lt;ref name=Blair513&gt;Blair &quot;Handlist of Anglo-Saxon Saints&quot; ''Local Saints and Local Churches'' p. 513&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[English Reformation]], Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.&lt;ref name=Folklore&gt;Smith &quot;St Augustine in History and Tradition&quot; ''Folklore'' pp. 23–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, a [[Celtic cross]] marks the spot in [[Ebbsfleet, Thanet]], [[East Kent]], where Augustine is said to have landed,&lt;ref name=Cross&gt;{{cite web |author=English Heritage |publisher=National Monuments Records |url=http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=469595&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=st%20augustines%20cross&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10 |year=2007 |accessdate=15 January 2011 |title=St Augustine's Cross |work=Pastscape}}&lt;/ref&gt; although historian Alan Kay told the BBC in 2005 that Augustine actually landed somewhere between Stonar and [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]]. According to Kay, Ebbsfleet was not on the coast in the 6th century. The story that Augustine landed there was started in 1884, he said, by a Victorian aristocrat who needed a publicity stunt to draw people to his newly opened tea rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/southeast/series7/mystery_of_history.shtml |title=The mystery of history|publisher= BBC|date= 7 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Hales'''(c.1185—1245) (also '''Halensis''', '''Alensis''', '''Halesius''', '''Alesius''';) also called ''Doctor Irrefragabilis'' (by [[Pope Alexander IV]] in the ''Bull De Fontibus Paradisi'') and ''Theologorum Monarcha'' was a notable thinker important in the history of [[scholasticism]] and the [[Franciscan]] School.

==Life==
Alexander was born at Hales (today [[Halesowen]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]]), [[Shropshire]], [[England]] between 1180 and 1186. He came from a rather wealthy country family. Alexander had gone to Paris in order to study the arts. After he had studied in Paris, he had become a master of arts sometime before 1210.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen,p.105&lt;/ref&gt; He had been made a canon of [[St. Paul]] in [[London]] later, and by 1231 was and Archdeacon of [[Coventry]]. At the age of 50 (ca. 1236-37), he had made the most significant change of his life and entered the [[Franciscan]] order. He had further become the first [[Franciscan]] to hold a University chair. Alexander had died in [[Paris]], [[France]] on August 21, 1245, but before passing he had resigned his chair in favour of [[Jean de la Rochelle]].

In being the first [[Franciscan]] to hold a choir at the [[University of Paris]], he had been the teacher of many significant disciples, most notably [[Bonaventure]]. Bonaventure referred to Alexander as his &quot;father and master&quot; and wished to &quot;follow in his footsteps&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen,p.105&lt;/ref&gt; Other disciples of include, [[Richard Rufus of Cornwall]] and [[Jean de la Rochelle]].

==Works==
Alexander is known for reflecting the works of several other Middle Age thinkers, especially that of [[Saint Anselm]], and [[Saint Augustine]]. He is also known to quote thinkers such as [[Saint Bernard]], and [[Richard of Saint-Victor]]. He differs from those in his genre as he his known to reflect his own interests and those of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Scoloasticism&lt;/ref&gt; When using the words of his authorities Alexander does not review their reasoning but also gives conclusions, expands on them, and offers his agreements and disagreement with them.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Scholasticism&lt;/ref&gt; He was also different in that his Pre-Lombardian figures, and use of [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] works were not cited as frequently by other 12th century scholastics.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Scholasticism&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle is also quite frequently quoted in Alexander's works. Alexander was fascinated by Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchy of angels and in how their nature can be understood, given Aristotelian [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Scholasticism&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the doctrines which were specially developed and, so to speak, fixed by Alexander of Hales, are the ''thesaurus supererogationis perfectorum'' (treasury of supererogatory merits) and the ''[[character indelibilis]]'' (sacramental character) of [[baptism]], [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]], and [[Holy Orders|ordination]]. That doctrine had been written about much earlier by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and was eventually defined a [[dogma]] by the [[Council of Trent]].  He also posed an important question about the cause of the [[Incarnation]]: would Christ have been incarnated if humanity had never sinned?  The question eventually became the focal point for a philosophical issue (the theory of possible worlds) and a theological topic on the distinction between God's absolute power (''potentia absoluta'') and His ordained power (''potentia ordinata''). John Gerson tells us “The doctrine of Alexander is of a wealth surpassing all expression. It is said that someone asked St. Thomas what was the best manner of studying theology; he replied that it was by attaching oneself to a Master. And to which Doctor? he was asked again. To Alexander of Hales, the [[Thomas Aquinas|Angelic Doctor]] replied.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gerson, Opera omnia. Epistola Lugdunum missa cuidam fratri Minori, vol. 1, p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summa Universae Theologiae===
He had written the summary/commentary of Peter Lombard's four books of the ''Sentences''. It had exposed the trinitarian theology of the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Backus,p.301&lt;/ref&gt; This had been the most important writing that Alexander had claimed, and had been the earliest in genre. While it is common for scholars to state that Alexander was the first to write a commentary on the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]], it is not quite accurate.  There were a number of &quot;commentaries&quot; on the ''Sentences'', but Alexander appears to have been the first magisterial commentary. Although it was Alexanders most significant writing, it had not been completed, therefore leaving historians left with many questions on the reliability and quality of the writing. This was taken into consideration when the ''Summa'' had been examined by Father Victorin Doucet for different editions of them. The sources has seem to be the resulting problem of the ''Summa'', &quot;counted there were 4814 explicit quotations and 1372 implicit quotations from [[Augustine]], more than one quarter of texts were cited in the body of the ''Summa''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Backus,p.&amp;nbsp;303&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Historical Works===
Among his own works Alexander also influenced [[Jean de la Rochelle]] to compose the ''Summa of Theologica''.&lt;ref&gt;Backus,p.302&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alexander also influenced and sometimes is confused with [[Alexander Carpenter]], Latinized as '''''Fabricius''''' (''fl.'' 1429), who was the author of the ''Destructorium viciorum'', a religious work popular in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Robert Owst: ''The Destructiorium viciorum of Alexander Carpenter'', Church Historical Society, [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], London, 1952, 40 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter also authored other works, such as &quot;''Homiliae eruditae''&quot; (&quot;Learned Sermons&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Sir Leslie Stephen and Sir Sidney Lee (eds.): ''The Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, vol. III (Brown - Chaloner), pp. 1062-1063.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Watson (ed.): ''The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, Volume 1, 600-1660''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974, p. 803.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiographical Contribution==
Alexander was said to have been the earliest scholastics to engage in Aristotle's newly translated writings ([[Metaphysics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cullen,p.104&lt;/ref&gt; This had been a very important to the ideals of scholastic thought. He had also steered scholasticism in a more systematic direction with him momentous decision to use the ''Sentences'' as the basic textbook for treating the whole of theology.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen,p.104&lt;/ref&gt; He also appears to be the first theologian to use more than by mere chance of haphazardly concepts drawn from the Metaphysics of [[Aristole]].&lt;ref&gt;Principe,p.215&lt;/ref&gt;

===A medieval scholastic===
In doing so, he elevated Lombard's work from a major theological resource to an authoritative text from which masters could teach. The commentary (or more correctly titled a ''Gloss'') survived in student reports from Alexander's teaching in the classroom and so it provides a major insight into the way theologians taught their discipline in the 1220s.

For his contemporaries, however, Alexander's fame was his inexhaustible interest in disputation.  His disputations prior to his becoming a Franciscan cover over 1,600 pages in their modern edition.  His disputed questions after 1236 remain unpublished.  Alexander was also one of the first scholastics to participate in the ''Quodlibetal'', a university event in which a master had to respond to any question posed by any student or master over a period of three days.  Alexander's ''Quodlibet'' also remains unedited. It is because of this questioning that he became known as the 'Doctor irrefragabilis'.

===Theologian===
When he became a Franciscan and thus created a formal Franciscan school of theology at Paris, it was soon clear that his students lacked some of the basic tools for the discipline.  Alexander responded by beginning a ''Summa theologiae'' that is now known as the ''Summa fratris Alexandri''.  Alexander drew mainly from his own disputations, but also selected ideas, arguments and sources from his contemporaries.  It treats in its first part the doctrines of [[God]] and his attributes; in its second, those of [[creation myth|creation]] and [[sin]]; in its third, those of [[Salvation|redemption]] and [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]; and, in its fourth and last, those of the [[sacrament]]s. This massive text, which [[Roger Bacon]] would later sarcastically describe as weighing as much as a horse, was unfinished at his death; his students, William of Middleton and John of Rupella, were charged with its completion.  It was certainly read by the Franciscans at Paris, including [[Bonaventure]].  Bonaventure once referred to Alexander as &quot;our father and master&quot; (''noster pater et magister''), but it is unlikely that the Seraphic Doctor ever studied under Alexander.

Alexander was an innovative theologian. He was part of the generation that first grappled with the writings of [[Aristotle]].  While there was a ban on using Aristotle's works as teaching texts, theologians like Alexander continued to exploit his ideas in their theology.  Two other uncommon sources were promoted by Alexander: [[Anselm of Canterbury]], whose writings had been ignored for almost a century gained an important advocate in Alexander and he used Anselm's works extensively in his teaching on [[Christology]] and [[soteriology]]; and, [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], whom Alexander used in his examination of the theology of Orders and ecclesiastical structures.

'''Active Server Pages''' ('''ASP'''), also known as ''Classic ASP'' or ''ASP Classic'', was [[Microsoft]]'s first [[server-side scripting|server-side]] [[Active Scripting|script-engine]] for [[dynamic web page|dynamically-generated web pages]]. Initially released as an add-on to [[Internet Information Services]] (IIS) via the [[Windows_NT_4.0#Option_Pack|Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack]] (ca 1998), it was subsequently included as a free component of Windows Server (since the initial release of [[Windows 2000 Server]]). [[ASP.NET]] has superseded ASP.

ASP 2.0 provided six [[Wiktionary:built-in|built-in]] [[Object (computer science)|objects]]: Application, ASPError, Request, Response, Server, and Session. &lt;code&gt;Session&lt;/code&gt;, for example, represents a [[http cookie|cookie-based]] [[Session (computer science)|session]] that maintains the state of [[Variable (programming)|variables]] from page to page. The [[Active Scripting]] engine's support of the [[Component Object Model]] (COM) enables ASP [[website]]s to access functionality in compiled [[Library (computing)|libraries]] such as [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]].

Web pages with the ''.asp'' [[file extension]] use ASP, although some web sites disguise their choice of scripting language for security purposes (e.g. still using the more common ''.htm'' or ''.html'' extension).
Pages with the ''.aspx'' extension use compiled [[ASP.NET]] (based on Microsoft's [[.NET Framework]]), which makes them faster and more robust than [[server-side scripting]] in ASP, which is interpreted at run-time; however, ASP.NET pages may still include some ASP scripting. The introduction of ASP.NET led to use of the term ''Classic ASP'' for the original technology.

Programmers write most ASP pages using [[VBScript]], but any other Active Scripting engine can be selected instead with the &lt;tt&gt;@Language&lt;/tt&gt; directive or the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script language=&quot;language&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; syntax. [[JScript]] (Microsoft's implementation of [[ECMAScript]]) is the other language that is usually available. [[PerlScript]] (a derivative of [[Perl]]) and others are available as third-party installable Active Scripting engines.

==Alternative interpreters==
There only a few alternative interpreters, and most of them are implemented in Java. Unlike the Mono ASP.net implementation, these versions tend to be quite different compared to the Microsoft interpreter, which results that not all scripts written for the Microsoft platform may be supported.

Example of these are
* '''[[Sun ONE]] Active Server Pages'''&lt;br /&gt;This version is EOL, and the latest version cannot be downloaded anymore. Some older versions still exist on the web.
* '''[http://www.tripi.com/arrowhead Arrowhead ASP]'''&lt;br/&gt;This is an ASP implementation in for Java Servlet containers, but it seems to be abandoned (latest release is 0.2.3 on June 14, 2004
* '''[http://cfasp.cloudfoundry.com CloudFoundry ASP]'''&lt;br /&gt;This is basically a repack of the Arrowhead ASP implementation, but with updated libraries and optimalisations for the [[Cloud Foundry]] platform. It seems to be quite recent, but the differences with Arrowhead are little.

[[Image:Amoxicillin.JPG|thumb|right|Amoxicillin BP]]
'''Amoxicillin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), formerly '''amoxycillin''' ([[British Approved Name|BAN]]), '''tormoxin''' (in India), '''amoxycillin''' (cilamox) in Australia,&lt;ref name=&quot;racgp&quot;&gt;[http://www.racgp.org.au/cmi/txcamoxc.pdf], Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Leaflet.&lt;/ref&gt; abbreviated '''amox''', is a moderate-spectrum, bacteriolytic, [[beta-lactam antibiotic|β-lactam]] [[antibiotic]] used to treat [[bacterial]] [[infection]]s caused by susceptible [[microorganism]]s. It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better absorbed, following oral administration, than other β-lactam antibiotics. Amoxicillin is one of the most common [[antibiotic]]s prescribed for children.

Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by [[beta-lactamase|β-lactamase]]-producing bacteria, which are resistant to a broad spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics, such as [[penicillin]].  For this reason, it is often combined with [[clavulanic acid]], a β-lactamase inhibitor, and marketed under one name. This increases effectiveness by reducing its susceptibility to β-lactamase resistance.

==Medical uses==
Amoxicllin is used in the treatment of a number of infections including: [[acute otitis media]], [[streptococcal pharyngitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[cellulitis|skin infections]], [[urinary tract infection]]s, ''[[salmonella]]'', [[lyme disease]], and chlamydia infections.&lt;ref name=AHFS&gt;{{cite web|title=Amoxicillin|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/amoxicillin.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to prevent [[bacterial endocarditis]] in high risk people who are having dental work done (though this is no longer done in the UK&lt;ref name=&quot;bnf57&quot;&gt;British National Formulary 57 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;), to prevent ''strep pneumococus'' infections in those without a [[spleen]], and for both the prevention and treatment of [[anthrax]].&lt;ref name=AHFS/&gt; It is also a treatment for [[cystic acne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Adolescent Acne: Management | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/430534_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adverse effects ==
[[Adverse drug reaction|Side-effect]]s are as those for other [[Beta-lactam antibiotic#Adverse effects|beta-lactam antibiotic]]s.
Side-effects include [[nausea]], vomiting, rashes, and antibiotic-associated [[colitis]]. Loose bowel movements (diarrhea) also may occur. Rarer, but patient-reported, side-effects include mental changes, lightheadedness, insomnia, confusion, anxiety, sensitivity to lights and sounds, and unclear thinking. Immediate medical care is required upon the first signs of these side-effects.

The onset of an allergic reaction to amoxicillin can be very sudden and intense - emergency medical attention must be sought as quickly as possible. The initial onset of such a reaction often starts with a change in mental state, skin rash with intense itching (often beginning in fingertips and around groin area and rapidly spreading), and sensations of fever, nausea, and vomiting. Any other symptoms that seem even remotely suspicious must be taken very seriously.
However, more mild allergy symptoms, such as a rash, can occur at any time during treatment, even up to a week after treatment has ceased.  For some people who are allergic to amoxicillin the side effects can be deadly.

Use of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination for more than one week has caused mild [[hepatitis]] in some patients. Young children having ingested acute overdoses of amoxicillin manifested [[lethargy]], vomiting and [[Renal failure|renal dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;Cundiff J, Joe S. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid-induced hepatitis. Amer. J. Otolaryngol. 28: 28-30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 81-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonallergic amoxicillin rash===
{{See also|Stevens–Johnson syndrome}}
Somewhere between 3% and 10% of children taking amoxicillin (or [[ampicillin]]) show a late-developing (&gt;72 hours after beginning medication and having never taken penicillin-like medication previously), often itchy rash, which is sometimes referred to as the &quot;amoxicillin rash.&quot; The rash can also occur in adults.

The rash is described as [[maculopapular]] or morbilliform ([[Measles|measles-like]]; therefore, in medical literature, it is called &quot;amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rash&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2654598 |title=Role of delayed cellular hypersensitivity and adhesion molecules in amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rashes |publisher=Cat.inist.fr |date= |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It starts on the trunk and can spread from there. This rash is unlikely to be a true allergic reaction, and is not a contraindication for future amoxicillin usage, nor should the current regimen necessarily be stopped. However, this common amoxicillin rash and a dangerous allergic reaction cannot easily be distinguished by inexperienced persons, and therefore a healthcare professional is often required to distinguish between the two.&lt;ref&gt;(Pichichero, 2005; Schmitt 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

A nonallergic amoxicillin rash may also be an indicator of [[infectious mononucleosis]]: Some studies indicate approximately 80-90% of patients with acute [[Epstein Barr virus]] infection treated with amoxicillin or [[ampicillin]] develop such a rash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kagan | first=B | title=Ampicillin rash |journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=333–335 |year=1977 | pmid=855325 | pmc=1237570}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Amoxicillin rash 26 hours after 17th dose.JPG|Twenty-three hours after first photo, the color appears to be fading, and much of rash has spread to confluence.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Interaction===

Amoxicillin may interact with the following groups of drugs:

* Anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin)&lt;ref name=bnf57/&gt;
* Allopurinol (gout treatment)
* Birth control pills
* Certain antibiotics
* Cancer treatment (methotrexate)
* Uricosuric drugs
* Typhoid vaccine

==Mechanism of action==
{{Main|Beta-lactam antibiotic}}
This drug acts by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial [[cell wall]]s. It inhibits [[cross-link]]age between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the [[cell wall]]s of both [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria]].

It has two [[ionizable]] groups in the physiological range (the amino group in alpha-position to the amide carbonyl group and the carboxyl group).

==Formulations==
===Modes of Delivery===
Amoxicillin in [[Hydrate|trihydrate]] form is available as capsules, chewable and dispersible [[tablet]]s plus syrup and [[pediatrics|pediatric]] [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] for oral use, and as the sodium salt for [[intravenous]] administration (although the IV formulation is not available in the United States&lt;ref&gt;www.UpToDate.com&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Amoxicillin is most commonly taken orally. The liquid forms are helpful where the patient might find it difficult to take tablets or capsules. 

There is recent research with mice that indicates successful delivery using intraperitoneally injected amoxicillin-bearing microparticles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioscirep.org/bsr/imps/pdf/BSR20100027.pdf Amoxicillin bearing microparticles: potential in treatment of Listeria monocytogenes infection in Swiss albino mice], Bioscience reports immediate publication, 2010-08-05, manuscript BSR 20100027&lt;/ref&gt;
