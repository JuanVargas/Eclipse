 Company]] was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated. Most of the company's ships were seized by Japan in 1941 and services did not resume until 1946. [[Robert Dollar]] was a later shipping magnate, who became enormously influential moving Californian and Canadian lumber to the Chinese and Japanese market.

Yichang or [[Ichang]], {{convert|1600|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from the sea, is the head of navigation for river steamers; oceangoing vessels may navigate the river to [[Hankow]], a distance of almost 1000&amp;nbsp;km (almost 600&amp;nbsp;mi) from the sea. For about {{convert|320|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} inland from its mouth, the river is virtually at sea level.

The Chinese Government, too, had steamers. It had its own naval fleet, the [[Nanyang Fleet]], which fell prey to the French fleet. The Chinese would rebuild its fleet,
only to be ravaged by another war with [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan (1895)]], [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution (1911)]] and ongoing inefficiency and corruption. Chinese companies ran their own steamers, but were second tier to European operations at the time.

====Navigation on the upper river====
Steamers came late to the upper river. The three gorges and the strong current hindered plans. Achibald Little attempted a voyage with the Lee-Chuan, and the Kuling, delays and weak engines
meant that he only succeeded in the first vessel in 1898. Little soon built the first truly successful boat, the Pioneer, about 1899 &amp;mdash; she plied the river for two more decades and was even the flagship{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} for the British Royal Navy on the [[China Station]]. There were a few commercial steamers on the upper river by the turn of the century and the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. The Commercial firms of [[Jardine Matheson]], [[Butterfield and Swire]], and [[Standard Oil]] had their own steamers on the river. Until 1881, the India and China coastal and river services were operated by several companies. In that year, however, these were merged into the [[Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, Ltd.]], a public company under the management of Jardines. The Jardine company pushed inland up the Yangtsze River on which a specially designed fleet was built to meet all requirements of the river trade. For many years, this fleet gave unequalled service.
Jardines established an enviable reputation for the efficient handling of shipping. As a result, the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] invited the firm to attend to the Agency of their [[Shire Line]] which operated in the Far East. Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An, and Mei Hsia, which were all destroyed on December 12, 1937 when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;Mender, P., Thirty Years A Mariner in the Far East 1907-1937, The Memoirs of Peter Mender, A Standard Oil Ship Captain on China's Yangtze River, p.53, ISBN 978-1-60910-498-6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Navy ships====
With the Treaty Ports, the European powers and Japan were allowed to float navy ships into China's internal waters. The British, US and French did this. A full international fleet featured on Chinese
waters: Austro-Hungarians, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, and German navy ships came to Shanghai and the treaty ports. The Japanese engaged in open war with the Chinese twice, and Russians twice, over conquest of the Chinese Qing empire — in the [[First Sino-Japanese War|First]] and Second Sino-Japanese War 1895, and 1905; and the [[Russo-Japanese war]] of 1904. Incidentally, both the French and Japanese navies were heavily involved in running opium and narcotics to Shanghai, where it was refined into morphine. It was then transhipped by liner back to Marseille and France (i.e. [[French Connection]]) for processing in Germany and eventual sale in the US or Europe.
[[Image:IJN Izumo in Shanghai.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Japanese cruiser Izumo|JN Izumo]] in Shanghai, 1937; she sank riverboats in 1941]]
In 1909 the gunboat [[USS Samar (PG-41)|USS Samar]] changed station to Shanghai, where she regularly patrolled the lower Yangtze River up to [[Nanking]] and Wuhu. Following an anti-foreign riots in [[Changsha]] in April 1910, which destroyed a number of missions and merchant warehouses, Samar sailed up the Yangtze River to [[Hankow]] and then Changsa to show the flag and help restore order. The gunboat was also administratively assigned to the [[Asiatic Fleet]] that year, which had been reestablished by the Navy to better protect, in the words of the Bureau of Navigation, &quot;American interests in the Orient.&quot; After returning to Shanghai in August, she sailed up river again the following summer, passing Wuhu in June but then running aground off [[Kichau]] on 1 July 1911.

After staying stuck in the mud for two weeks, Samar broke free and sailed back down river to coal ship. Returning upriver, the gunboat reached Hankow in August and [[Ichang]] in September where she wintered over owing to both the dry season and the outbreak of rebellion at [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] in October 1911. Tensions eased and the gunboat turned downriver in July 1912, arriving at Shanghai in October. Samar patrolled the lower Yangtze after fighting broke out in the summer 1913, a precursor to a decade of conflict between provincial warlords in China. In 1919, she was placed on the disposal list at Shanghai following a collision with a Yangtze river steamer that damaged her bow.

The Spanish boats were replaced in the twenties by the [[USS Luzon (PG-47)|''Luzon'']] and [[USS Mindanao (PR-8)|''Mindanao'']] were the largest, [[USS Oahu (PR-36)|''Oahu'']] and [[USS Panay (PR-5)|''Panay'']] next in size, and [[USS Guam (PG-43)|''Guam'']] and [[USS Tutuila (PG-44)|''Tutuila'']] the smallest. China in the first fifty years of the twentieth century, was in low-grade chaos. Warlords, revolutions, natural disasters, civil war and invasions contributed. Yangtze boats were involved in the [[Nanjing Incident]] in 1927 when the Communists and Nationalists broke into open war. The [[Chiang Kai-shek|Chiang]]'s [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|massacre of the Communists]] in Shanghai in 1927 furthered the unrest, US Marines with tanks were landed. River steamers were popular targets for both Nationalists and Communists, and peasants who would take periodic pot-shots at vessels. During the course of service the second [[USS Palos]] protected American interests in China down the entire length of the Yangtze, at times convoying U.S. and foreign vessels on the river, evacuating American citizens during periods of disturbance and in general giving credible presence to U.S. consulates and residences in various Chinese cities. In the period of great unrest in central China in the 1920s, Palos was especially busy patrolling the upper Yangtze against bands of warlord soldiers and outlaws. The warship engaged in continuous patrol operations between Ichang and [[Chungking]] throughout 1923, supplying armed guards to merchant ships, and protecting Americans at Chungking while that city was under siege by a warlord army

The British [[Royal Navy]] had a series of [[Insect class gunboat]]s which patrolled between [[Chongqing]] and [[Shanghai]]. Cruisers and destroyers and Fly class{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} vessels also patrolled. The most infamous incident was when [[USS Panay]] and [[HMS Bee (1915)|HMS Bee]] in 1937,were dive bombed by Japanese airplanes during the [[Nanking Massacre]]. The Europeans were forced to leave the Yangtse River with the Japanese takeover in 1941. The former steamers were either sabotaged or pressed into Japanese or Chinese service.  Probably the most curious incident involved [[HMS Amethyst (F116)|HMS Amethyst]] in 1949 during the [[Chinese Civil war]] between [[Kuomintang]] and [[People's Liberation Army]] forces; and led to the award of the [[Dickin Medal]] to the ship's cat [[Simon (cat)|Simon]].

{{Main|Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|Yangtze River Power Line Crossings}}
Until 1957, there were no bridges across the Yangtze River from Yibin to Shanghai.  For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry.  The river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China.  In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] and [[Pukou]], and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train.  After the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], a dual-use [[list of road-rail bridges|road-rail bridge]], built from 1955 to 1957.  It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River.  The second bridge across the river was built a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959.  The [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in [[Nanjing]].  It was built after the [[Sino-Soviet Split]] and did not receive foreign assistance.  Road-rail bridges were then built in [[Zhicheng]] (1971) and Chongqing (1980).

Bridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century.  The [[Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge]] was built in 1992 as part of the [[Jingjiu railway|Beijing-Jiujiang Railway]].  A [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|second bridge in Wuhan]] was completed in 1995.  By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai.  These include some of the longest [[suspension bridge|suspension]] and [[cable-stayed bridge]]s in the world on the Yangtze Delta: [[Jiangyin Suspension Bridge]] (1385m, opened in 1999), [[Runyang Bridge]] (1490m, opened 2005), [[Sutong Bridge]] (1088m, opened 2008).  The rapid pace of bridge construction has continued.  The city of Wuhan now has six bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze.

A number of [[Yangtze River Power Line Crossings|power line crossings]] have also been built across the river.

As of 2007, there are two dams built on the Yangtze river: Three Gorges Dam and [[Gezhouba Dam]] with a third one, [[Xiluodu Dam]] under construction. More dams are in planning stage, such as Wudongde, Baihetan, and Xiangjiaba.

==Tributaries==
[[Image:Yangzi river ship yard on river bank.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A shipyard on the banks of the Yangtze building commercial river freight boats]]

The Yangtze River has over 700 [[tributaries]]. The major tributaries (listed from upstream to downstream) with the locations of where they join the Yangtze are:
*[[Yalong River]] (Yunnan Province)
*[[Min River (Sichuan)|Min River]] ([[Yibin]], Sichuan Province)
*[[Jialing River]] ([[Chongqing]])
*[[Wu River (Yangtze River tributary)|Wu Jiang]]

==Wildlife==
The Yangtze is home to at least three critically endangered species: The [[Chinese Alligator]], the [[Finless Porpoise]] and the [[Chinese Paddlefish]].  (This is the only other place besides the U.S. that is native to an alligator species.)  The [[Finless Porpoise]] were counted in 2010 to be 1000 exemplars. More species have become extinct in the Yangtze than in any other river in China.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This is due to commercial use of the river coupled with tourism and pollution. In December 2006, the [[Baiji]] (Chinese River Dolphin) was declared [[functional extinction|functionally extinct]] after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin's inhabitance; however, one was sighted soon after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencemode.com/2007/09/02/river-dolphin-thought-to-be-extinct-spotted-again-in-china/ ScienceMode » River Dolphin Thought to be Extinct Spotted Again in China]&lt;/ref&gt;

Square re-released a ported version by [[TOSE|Tose]] in Japan for [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1999, later repackaged with a ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' port as ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'' in 2001 for the North American market. A slightly enhanced ''Chrono Trigger'' was  released for the [[Nintendo DS]] on November 25, 2008, in North America and Japan, and went on sale in Australia on February 3, 2009 and in Europe on February 6, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://na.square-enix.com/ctds/ |title=Chrono Trigger for Nintendo DS |publisher=Square Enix |date= |accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was never released in PAL teritories before the Nintendo DS version.

''Chrono Trigger'' was well-received by reviewers and commercially successful upon release; it is now considered one of the greatest games of all time. ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine described certain aspects of ''Chrono Trigger'' as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related [[Quest (gaming)|sidequests]] focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.&lt;ref name=&quot;npreview1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |month=July | year=1995 |volume=74 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Epic Center: Chrono Trigger |pages=&amp;nbsp;52}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chrono Trigger'' was the third best-selling game of 1995, and the game's SNES and PSX iterations have shipped 2.65 million copies as of March 31, 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;1995 sales&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;square-sales&quot;/&gt; ''Chrono Trigger DS'' has sold 790,000 copies as of March 31, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;square-sales-ds&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.square-enix.com/eng/pdf/news/20090525_01en.pdf#page=7 |title=Results Briefing Session for the Fiscal Year ended March 31, 2009 |date=2009-05-25 |accessdate=2010-07-16 |publisher=[[Square Enix]] |page=28 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Square has announced that ''Chrono Trigger'' will be ported to mobile phones,&lt;ref name=&quot;mobileteaser&quot;&gt;{{cite web | month=January| year=2011 | title=Chrono Trigger | Square Enix | url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/mobile/sem/chronotrigger/ | publisher=[[Square Enix]] | accessdate=2011-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Virtual Console]],&lt;ref name=&quot;virtualconsole&quot;&gt;{{cite web | month=March| year=2011 | title=Chrono Trigger TIme Warps to Virtual Console Next Month | Siliconera | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/03/25/chrono-trigger-time-warps-to-virtual-console-next-month/ | publisher=Siliconera.com | accessdate=2011-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PlayStation Network]] in 2011.

==Gameplay==
''Chrono Trigger'' features standard [[console role-playing game]] (RPG) gameplay with several innovations. The player controls the protagonist and his companions in the game's [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[fictional universe|fictional world]], consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an [[overworld]] map, depicting the landscape from a scaled down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. ''Chrono Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s gameplay deviates from that of traditional RPGs in that, rather than appearing in [[random encounter]]s, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;npreview2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |month=July | year=1995 |volume=74 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Epic Center: Chrono Trigger |pages=&amp;nbsp;53}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:ChronoTriggerInside.PNG|thumb|left|Example of a basic battle|alt=A wooded area rendered in the Super Nintendo's graphics, two gray status bars (one at the top, one at the bottom of the screen), three &quot;Blue Imp&quot; enemies surrounding the character Crono in the middle of the area, Crono slashing at the topmost imp which has a surprised expression on its face]]
Players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves.  Each character and enemy has a certain number of [[hit point]]s, and successful attacks reduce that character's hit points, while hit points can be restored with potions and spells.  When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints; if all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter, except in specific storyline-related battles that allow or force the player to lose.  Between battles, the player can equip his/her characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power or defense against magic), and various consumable items can be used both in and out of battles.  Items and equipment can be purchased in shops or found on field maps, often in [[treasure chest (video games)|treasure chests]].  By exploring new areas and fighting enemies, players progress through ''Chrono Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s story.

''Chrono Trigger'' uses an [[Active Time Battle]] system—a staple of Square's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game series designed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]] for ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''—named &quot;Active Time Battle 2.0.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Battle 2.0&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co. | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System  | quote='''Menu screen:''' Active Time Battle 2.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer dependent on the character's speed [[Attribute (role-playing games)|statistic]] counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques are handled through a system called &quot;Techs.&quot; Techs deplete a character's [[magic point]]s (a numerical meter like hit points), and often have special [[area of effect|areas of effect]]; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of ''Chrono Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;npreview2&quot; /&gt; Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others' to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono's sword-spinning ''Cyclone'' Tech can be combined with Lucca's ''Flame Toss'' to create ''Flame Whirl''. When characters with compatible Techs have enough magic points available to perform their techniques, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.

''Chrono Trigger'' features several other unique gameplay traits, including [[time travel]]. Players have access to seven eras of the game world's history, and past actions affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete side quests, and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called &quot;time gates&quot;, as well as a [[time travel|time machine]] named ''[[Epoch (Chrono Trigger)|Epoch]]''. The game contains thirteen unique endings; the ending the player receives depends on when and how he or she reaches and completes the game's final battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;nppreview&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| volume=73 |month=June | year=1995 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Chrono Trigger: A New Standard for RPGs | pages=&amp;nbsp;37}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chrono Trigger DS'' features a new ending that can be accessed from the End of Time upon completion of the final extra dungeon and optional final boss.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsultimania&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Chrono Trigger Ultimania | page=581 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Supporting_Material_Translation.html#Chrono_Trigger_Ultimania | isbn=978-4-7575-2469-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chrono Trigger'' also introduces a [[New Game Plus|New Game+]] option; after completing the game, the player may begin a new game with the same character [[Experience point|levels]], [[Skill (role-playing games)|techniques]], and equipment (but not money) that he or she ended the previous game with. Certain items central to the storyline are removed and must be found again, such as the sword Masamune. Square has since employed the New Game+ concept in later titles, including ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', ''[[Parasite Eve series|Parasite Eve]]'', ''[[Vagrant Story]]''  and ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''.

==Plot==
===Setting===
''Chrono Trigger'' takes place in an original world similar to Earth, with eras such as the prehistoric age, where early humans and dinosaurs share the earth; the [[Middle Ages]], replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future, where humans and sentient robots struggle to survive. The characters frequently [[time travel|travel through time]] to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year ∞), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the ''Wings of Time,'' nicknamed the ''Epoch.'' The vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period without first having to travel to the End of Time.

===Characters===
{{main|Characters of Chrono Trigger}}
''Chrono Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s seven playable characters come from different eras in the game world's history. ''Chrono Trigger'' begins in 1000 AD with [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Crono|Crono]], [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Marle|Marle]], and [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Lucca|Lucca]]. Crono is the silent protagonist, characterized as a fearless young man who wields a [[katana]] in battle. Marle (Princess Nadia) lives in Guardia Castle; though sheltered, at heart she's a princess who enjoys hiding her royal identity. Lucca is a friend of Crono's and a mechanical genius; her home is filled with laboratory equipment and machinery. From the era of AD 2300 comes [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Robo|Robo]], or Prometheus (designation R66-Y), a robot with near-human personality created to assist humans. Laying dormant in the future, Robo is found and repaired by Lucca. He joins the group out of gratitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;characters&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles instruction manual | pages=&amp;nbsp;32–33 | publisher=Square Enix  | id=SLUS-01363}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fiercely confident [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Ayla|Ayla]] dwells in 65,000,000 BC. Unmatched in raw strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village, and leads her people in war against a species of humanoid [[reptile]]s known as Reptites.

The last two characters are [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Frog|Frog]] and [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Magus|Magus]]. Frog originated in AD 600. Frog is a former [[squire]] once named Glenn; Magus turned Glenn into an [[Kemono|anthropomorphic]] frog and also slew his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus. Meanwhile, Guardia in AD 600 is in a state of conflict against the Mystics (known as Fiends in the US/DS port), a race of demons and intelligent animals. Under the leadership of Magus, a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]], they wage war against humanity. While Magus appears to be a powerful magician, his seclusion conceals a long-lost past; in Antiquity, he was known as Janus, the young prince of the Kingdom of Zeal, which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 BC. The incident sent him forward through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods over the fate of his sister, [[List of characters in Chrono Trigger#Schala|Schala]].&lt;ref name=&quot;characters&quot; /&gt; Lavos, who awakens and ravages the world in AD 1999, is an extraterrestrial parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the Earth's energy for its own growth.

===Story===
In 1000 AD, Crono and Marle watch Lucca and her father demonstrate her new [[teleportation|teleporter]] at the Millennial Fair. When Marle volunteers to be teleported, her pendant interferes with the device and creates a time portal that she is drawn into.&lt;ref name=&quot;portal&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 |platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=Leene Square |quote='''Taban:''' What's going on Lucca?

Lucca realizes that this time period's kingdom has mistaken Marle for her kidnapped ancestor, thus putting off the recovery effort for her ancestor and creating a [[grandfather paradox]]. Crono and Lucca, with the help of Frog, restore history to normal by recovering the kidnapped girl. After returning to the present, Crono is arrested on charges of kidnapping the princess and sentenced to death by the current chancellor of Truce. Lucca and Marle help Crono to flee, haphazardly using another time portal to escape their pursuers. Upon arriving in the year 2300 AD, they eventually learn that an advanced civilization has been wiped out by a giant creature known as Lavos that appeared in 1999 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;dayoflavos&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=Arris Dome |quote='''Marle:''' Say, what does this button do? / '''Lucca:''' 1999 A.D.?

After meeting and repairing Robo, Crono and his friends find Gaspar, an old sage at the End of Time, who helps them acquire magical powers and travel through time by way of several pillars of light.

Their party expands to include Ayla and Frog after they visit the prehistoric era to repair Frog's sword. They challenge Magus in 600 AD, believing him to be the source of Lavos; a summoning spell causes a time gate after the battle that throws Crono and his friends to the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;lavos-created&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=Heckran Cave |quote='''Heckran:''' If only the great Magus who brought forth Lavos 400 years ago, had destroyed the human race! }}&lt;/ref&gt; In prehistory, Crono, Ayla, and the others battle the Reptites and witness the origin of Lavos. They learn that Lavos was an alien being that arrived on the planet millions of years in the past, and began to absorb [[DNA]] and energy from every living creature before arising and razing the planet's surface in 1999 AD so that it could spawn a new generation. In 12,000 BC, Crono and friends find that the Kingdom of Zeal recently discovered Lavos and seeks to drain its power to achieve immortality through the Mammon Machine. However Zeal's leader, Queen Zeal, banishes them from the realm and seals the time gate they used to travel to the Dark Ages. They travel next to 2300 AD to find a time machine called the Wings of Time (or ''Epoch''), which can access any time period without using a time gate. They travel back to Zeal for the Mammon Machine's activation at the Ocean Palace. Lavos awakens, disturbed by the Mammon Machine, and the prophet reveals himself to be Magus and tries to kill the creature.&lt;ref name=&quot;magusrevealed&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=Heckran Cave |quote='''Magus:''' I've waited for this...

My powers are being drained! }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crono stands up to Lavos but is vaporized by a powerful blast, after which Lavos destroys Zeal.

Crono's friends awake in a village and find Magus, who confesses that he was prince Janus of Zeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;janus&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=North Cape |quote='''Magus:''' Behold.

Janus took the alias of Magus and gained a cult of followers while plotting to summon and kill Lavos in revenge for the death of his sister, Schala. As Crono's friends depart, the Ocean Palace rises into the air as the Black Omen. The group turns to Gaspar for help, and he gives them a &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, an egg-shaped device that allows the group to replace Crono just before the moment of death with a [[doppleganger|Dopple Doll]]. Crono and his friends then gather power by helping people across time with Gaspar's instructions.&lt;ref name=&quot;itll-help&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level= The End of Time |quote='''Gaspar:''' Just as you touch the lives of every life form you meet, so, too, will their energy strengthen you. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their journeys involve defeating the remnants of the Mystics,&lt;ref name=&quot;generals&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=Ozzie's Fort |quote='''Ozzie:''' Magus!

If Magus joined the party, he departs to search for Schala. Crono's mother accidentally enters the time gate at the fair before it closes, prompting Crono, Marle, and Lucca to set out in the Epoch to find her while fireworks light up the night sky.&lt;ref name=&quot;crono'smom&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1995-08-22 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=Leene Square |quote='''Mom:''' Look, Crono!

We have a Time Machine! }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, if the party used the Epoch to break Lavos's outer shell, Marle will help her father hang Nadia's bell at the festival and accidentally get carried away by several balloons. Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them down to earth. Hanging on in each others arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.

''Chrono Trigger DS'' added two new scenarios to the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsultimania&quot; /&gt; In the first, Crono and his friends can help a &quot;lost sanctum&quot; of Reptites, who reward powerful items and armor. The second scenario adds ties to ''Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s sequel, ''Chrono Cross''.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsultimania&quot; /&gt; In a New Game +, the group can explore several temporal distortions to combat shadow versions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca, and to fight Dalton, who promises in defeat to raise an army in the town of Porre to destroy the Kingdom of Guardia.&lt;ref name=&quot;daltonpromise&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-11-25 | platform =Nintendo DS |level=Twilight Grotto |quote='''Dalton''': If it weren't for you, I'd have been the ruler of an age all my own!

A version of Magus pleads with Schala to resist; though she recognizes him as her brother, she refuses to be helped and sends him away. Magus subsequently erases his memories and awakens in a forest, determined to find what he had lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;magusdsending&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=2008-11-25 | platform =Nintendo DS |level=Twilight Grotto |quote='''Magus''': Hmph.

==Development history==
''Chrono Trigger'' was conceived in 1992 by [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], producer and creator of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series; [[Yuji Horii]], director and creator of the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series; and [[Akira Toriyama]], famous [[manga artist]] and creator of the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjump1&quot;&gt;{{cite video | date=1994 | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Alpha_Version_Screenshot.html | title=V-Jump Festival 1994 | medium=VHS tape | location=Japan | publisher=Shueisha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling to America to research computer graphics, the three decided to create something that &quot;no one had done before.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vjump1&quot; /&gt; After spending over a year considering the difficulties of developing a new game, they received a call from [[Kazuhiko Aoki]], who offered to produce.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjump1&quot; /&gt; The four met and spent four days brainstorming ideas for the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjump1&quot; /&gt; Aoki ultimately produced ''Chrono Trigger'', while director credits were attributed to [[Akihiko Matsui]], [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Takashi Tokita]]. Toriyama designed the game's aesthetic, including characters, monsters, vehicles, and the look of each era.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjump1&quot; /&gt; [[Masato Kato]] also contributed character ideas and designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsultimania&quot; /&gt; Kato planned to feature Gaspar as a playable character and Toriyama sketched him, but he was cut early in development.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjumpplayersguide&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year=1995 | editor=V-Jump | title=Chrono Trigger V-Jump Player's Guide | page=189 | language=Japanese | publisher=V-Jump}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development staff studied the drawings of Toriyama to approximate his style.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; Sakaguchi and Horii supervised; Sakaguchi was responsible for the game's overall system and contributed several monster ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjump1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; The game was originally developed without involvement from Tokita and Kitase, who had been busy directing ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.

Then the staff brainstorm and come up with a variety of attractions to put in.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; Sakaguchi contributed some minor elements, including the character Gato; he liked Marle's drama and reconciliation with her father.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; Masato Kato subsequently edited and completed the outline by writing the majority of the game's story, including all the events of the 12,000 BC. era.&lt;ref name=&quot;procyon&quot; /&gt; Kato and other developers held a series of meetings to ensure continuity, usually attended by around 30 personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamest&quot; /&gt; Kato devised the system of multiple endings because he could not branch the story out to different paths.&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklyfamitsu&quot; /&gt; [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Takashi Tokita]] then wrote various [[subplot]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;procyon&quot; /&gt; Kato became friends with composer Yasunori Mitsuda during development, and they would collaborate on several future projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;procyon&quot; /&gt; Katsuhisa Higuchi programmed the battle system, which hosted combat on the map without transition to a special battleground as most previous Square games had done.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamest&quot; /&gt; Higuchi noted extreme difficulty in loading battles properly without slow-downs or a brief, black loading screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamest&quot; /&gt; The game's use of animated monster sprites consumed much more memory than previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, which used static enemy graphics.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamest&quot; /&gt;

Hironobu Sakaguchi likened the development of ''Chrono Trigger'' to &quot;play[ing] around with Toriyama's universe,&quot; citing the inclusion of humorous sequences in the game that would have been &quot;impossible with something like ''Final Fantasy''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; When Square Co. suggested a non-human player character, developers created Frog by adapting one of Toriyama's sketches.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; The team created the End of Time to help players with hints, worrying that they might become stuck and need to consult a walkthrough.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; The game's testers had previously complained that ''Chrono Trigger'' was too difficult; as Horii explained, &quot;It's because we know too much. The developers think the game's just right; that they’re being too soft. They're thinking from their own experience. The puzzles were the same. Lots of players didn’t figure out things we thought they’d get easily.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; Sakaguchi later cited the unusual desire of beta testers to play the game a second time or &quot;travel through time again&quot; as an affirmation of the New Game + feature: &quot;Wherever we could, we tried to make it so that a slight change in your behavior caused subtle differences in people’s reactions, even down to the smallest details...I think the second playthrough will hold a whole new interest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; The game's reuse of locations due to time traveling made bug-fixing difficult, as corrections would cause unintended consequences in other eras.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamest&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |month=March | year=1995 |journal=Gamest |publisher=Shinseisha |url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Supporting_Material_Translation.html#Chrono_Trigger_Gamest_Coverage |pages=211–215 |title=Chrono Trigger Development Team Special Talk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original release===
The team planned to release ''Chrono Trigger'' in late 1994, but release was pushed back to the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; Early [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha versions]] of ''Chrono Trigger'' were demonstrated at the 1994 and 1995 [[V-Jump]] festivals in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;alphaversion&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Alpha Versions | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Alpha_Version_Screenshot.html | publisher=Chrono Compendium | accessdate=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months prior to the game's release, Square shipped a [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta version]] to magazine reviewers and game stores for review. An unfinished build of the game dated November 17, 1994, it contains unused music tracks, locations, and other features changed or removed from the final release—such as a dungeon named &quot;Singing Mountain&quot; and its eponymous tune.&lt;ref name=&quot;prereleasemain&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger ([http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Trigger_Prerelease.html Prerelease]) | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1994-11-17 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;singing-mountain&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger ([http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Trigger_Prerelease.html Prerelease]) | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1994-11-17 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=[http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Singing_Mountain Singing Mountain] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some names also differed; the character Soysaw (Slash in the US version) was known as Wiener, while Mayonnay (Flea in the US version) was named Ketchappa.&lt;ref name=&quot;translated-prerelease&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger ([http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Trigger_Prerelease.html Prerelease]) | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=1994-11-17 | platform =Super Nintendo Entertainment System |level=[http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Translated_Text_(CTP).html Medina Elder's House]  | quote=私は、ケチャッパ。日夜、魔王様をあがめて、魔族がこの地を手に入れる日を願い続けているのよ。 / オレは、ワイナー。魔族がその力を取り戻す日にそなえて剣の修行にいそしんでいるのだ。}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ROM image]] for this early version was eventually uploaded to the internet, prompting fans to explore and document the game's differences, including two unused world map NPC character sprites and presumed additional sprites for certain [[non-player character]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;prereleasemain&quot; /&gt; Around the game's release, Yuji Horii commented that ''Chrono Trigger'' &quot;went beyond [the development team's] expectations,&quot; and Hironobu Sakaguchi congratulated the game's graphic artists and field designers.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year=1995 | editor=V-Jump | title=Chrono Trigger: The Perfect ([http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Trigger:_The_Perfect.html Translation]) | page=290 | language=Japanese | publisher=Shueisha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakaguchi intended to perfect the &quot;sense of dancing you get from exploring Toriyama's worlds&quot; in the event that they would make a sequel.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt;

''Chrono Trigger'' used a 32-[[megabit]] [[cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]] with battery-backed [[Random access memory|RAM]] for [[saved game]]s, lacking special on-cartridge coprocessors.

===PlayStation release===
Square released an enhanced [[porting|port]] of ''Chrono Trigger'' developed by [[TOSE|Tose]] in Japan for the Sony [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1999. Square timed its release before that of ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', the 1999 sequel to ''Chrono Trigger'', to familiarize new players with story leading up to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; This version included [[anime]] cut scenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama's [[Bird Studio]] and animated by [[Toei Animation]], as well as several bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. Scenarist Masato Kato attended planning meetings at Bird Studio to discuss how the ending cut scenes would illustrate subtle ties to ''[[Chrono Cross]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; The port was later released in North America in 2001—along with a newly translated version of ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''—under the package title ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]''. Reviewers criticized ''Chronicles'' for lengthy load times and an absence of new in-game features.&lt;ref name=&quot;loadtime&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles for PlayStation Review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasychronicles/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary%3Bread-review&amp;page=2 | publisher=GameSpot |author= Shoemaker, Brad |accessdate=December 27, 2008 | date= 2001-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nintendo DS release===&lt;!--This section is linked from redirect [[Chrono Trigger DS]]--&gt;
On July 2, 2008, Square Enix announced that they were officially planning to bring ''Chrono Trigger'' to the [[Nintendo DS]] handheld platform.  Composer [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] was pleased with the project, exclaiming &quot;finally!&quot; after receiving the news from Square Enix and maintaining, &quot;it's still a very deep, very high-quality game even when you play it today. I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think about it when they play it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;famitsujuly2008&quot; /&gt; Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 [[Tokyo Game Show]].&lt;ref name=&quot;famitsutgs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=【ブースリポート】スクウェア・エニックスブースでは『FFXIII』ほかの最新映像を上映 |publisher=Famitsu |date=October 9, 2008 |url=http://www.famitsu.com/event/tgs/2008/1218697_1829.html |accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chrono Trigger'' was scored primarily by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], as well as veteran ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], with one track composed by both Uematsu and [[Noriko Matsueda]]. A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda was unhappy with his pay and threatened to leave Square if he could not compose music.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerup&quot; /&gt; Hironobu Sakaguchi suggested he score ''Chrono Trigger'', remarking, &quot;maybe your salary will go up.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mitsuda2008&quot; /&gt; Mitsuda composed new music and drew on a personal collection of songs composed over the previous two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsultimania&quot; /&gt; He reflected, &quot;I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre...music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;powerup&quot; /&gt; Mitsuda slept in his studio several nights, and attributed certain songs—such as the game's ending theme, ''To Far Away Times''—to inspiring dreams.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitsuda2008&quot; /&gt; He later attributed this song to an idea he was developing before ''Chrono Trigger'', reflecting that the song was made in dedication to &quot;a certain person with whom I wanted to share a generation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ctdsmitsudainterview&quot; /&gt; He also tried to use [[leitmotif]]s of the ''Chrono Trigger'' main theme to create a sense of consistency in the soundtrack.&lt;ref name=&quot;sekitopsx&quot; /&gt; Mitsuda wrote each song to be around two minutes long before repeating, unusual for Square's games at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamest&quot; /&gt; Mitsuda suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;famitsujuly2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| year=2008 | journal=[[Famitsu]] | title=Chrono Trigger DS | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/July_2008_Weekly_Famitsu_Interview_with_Yasunori_Mitsuda.html   | pages=&amp;nbsp;67–70 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Mitsuda contracted [[Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcers]], Uematsu joined the project to compose ten songs and finish the score.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerup&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | year=2004 | first=Chris |last=Kohler |authorlink=Chris Kohler | title=[[Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life]] | publisher=DK Publishing  | isbn=0-7440-0424-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game's release, crying upon seeing the finished scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;famitsujuly2008&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Yasunori Mitsuda.jpg‎|thumb|left|Yasunori Mitsuda, the main composer of the game]]
At the time of the game's release, the number of tracks and sound effects was unprecedented—the soundtrack spanned three discs in its 1995 commercial pressing.&lt;ref name=&quot;npreview1&quot; /&gt; Square also released a one-disc [[acid jazz]] arrangement called &quot;''[[The Brink of Time]]''&quot; by [[Guido (jazz band)|Guido]] that year. ''The Brink of Time'' came about because Mitsuda wanted to do something that no one else was doing, and he noted that acid jazz and its related genres were uncommon in the Japanese market.&lt;ref name=&quot;sekitopsx&quot; /&gt; Mitsuda considers ''Chrono Trigger'' a landmark title which helped mature his talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=5478 |title=Yasunori Mitsuda Interview |accessdate=2007-05-22 | first=James |last=Gay | date=October 13, 2006 | publisher=PALGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Mitsuda later held that the title piece was &quot;rough around the edges,&quot; he maintains that it had &quot;significant influence on my life as a composer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ctdsmitsudainterview&quot; /&gt; In 1999, Square produced another one-disc soundtrack to complement the PlayStation release of ''Trigger'', featuring [[orchestra]]l tracks used in [[cut scene]]s.

{{cquote2|I feel that the way we interact with music has changed greatly in the last 13 years, even for me. For better or for worse, I think it would be extremely difficult to create something as &quot;powerful&quot; as I did 13 years ago today. But instead, all that I have learned in these 13 years allows me to compose something much more intricate. To be perfectly honest, I find it so hard to believe that songs from 13 years ago are loved this much. Keeping these feelings in mind, I hope to continue composing songs which are powerful, and yet intricate...I hope that the extras like this bonus CD will help expand the world of Chrono Trigger, especially since we did a live recording. I hope there's another opportunity to release an album of this sort one day.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctdsmitsudainterview&quot; /&gt;}}

Music from ''Chrono Trigger'' was performed live by the [[Tokyo Symphony Orchestra]] in 1996 at the [[Orchestral Game Concert]] in Tokyo, Japan. A suite of music including ''Chrono Trigger'' is a part of the symphonic world-tour with video game music [[Play!

''Chrono Trigger'' garnered much critical praise in addition to its brisk sales. ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' called it Square's &quot;biggest game ever&quot;, citing improved graphics, sound, and gameplay over past RPG titles. ''Chrono Trigger'' won multiple awards from [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'s 1995 video game awards, including Best Role-Playing Game, Best Music in a Cartridge-Based Game, and Best Super NES Game.&lt;ref name=&quot;egmbuyersguide1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1996 |month= |title=Electronic Gaming Monthly's Buyer's Guide |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= |accessdate=2009-01-09 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' described ''Trigger'' as &quot;original and extremely captivating&quot;, singling out its graphics, sound and story as particularly impressive.&lt;ref name=&quot;npreview1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;loadtime&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | month=August | year=2001 | editor=Sam Kennedy | journal=[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]] |issue=47 | pages=&amp;nbsp;107 | publisher=Ziff Davis Media Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN commented that &quot;it may be filled with every imaginable console RPG cliché, but ''Chrono Trigger'' manages to stand out among the pack&quot; with &quot;a [captivating] story that doesn't take itself too serious [sic]&quot; and &quot;one of the best videogame soundtracks ever produced&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign-review&quot; /&gt; Other reviewers (such as the staff of RPGFan and [[RPGamer]]) have criticized the game's short length and relative ease compared to its peers.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFC-Sales&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;playtime2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | date=October 30, 2001 | author=Bahamut | title=RPGFan Reviews - Chrono Trigger | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/chronotrigger/Chrono_Trigger-6.html | publisher=RPGFan | accessdate=July 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, critics lauded ''Chrono Trigger'' for its &quot;fantastic yet not overly complex&quot; story, simple but innovative gameplay, and high replay value afforded by multiple endings.

==Legacy==
===Add-ons===
''Chrono Trigger'' inspired several expansion packs or add-ons; the first were three titles released for the [[Satellaview]] in 1995. They included ''Chrono Trigger: Jet Bike Special'', a [[racing game]] based on a [[minigame]] from the original; ''Chrono Trigger: Character Library'', featuring profiles on characters and monsters from the game; and ''Chrono Trigger: Music Library'', a collection of music from the game's soundtrack. The contents of ''Character Library'' and ''Music Library'' were later included as extras in the PlayStation rerelease of ''Chrono Trigger''. [[Production I.G]] created a 16-minute [[Original video animation|OVA]] entitled &quot;''[[Nuumamonja: Time and Space Adventures]]''&quot; which was shown at the Japanese [[V-Jump]] Festival of July 31, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=時空冒険ぬうまもんじゃ～ |url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/contents/works_sp/0330_/index.html |author=Production I.G staff |publisher=[[Production I.G]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar |url=http://www.production-ig.com/contents/works/07_/000133.html |author=Production I.G staff |publisher=[[Production I.G]] |accessdate=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fangames===
There have been two notable attempts by ''Chrono Trigger'' fans to unofficially remake parts of the game for [[personal computer|PC]] with a [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] engine. ''[[Chrono Resurrection]]'', an attempt at remaking ten small interactive cut scenes from ''Chrono Trigger'', and ''Chrono Trigger Remake Project'', which sought to remake the entire game,&lt;ref name=&quot;resurrection&quot;&gt;{{cite web | date=2004-09-06 | author=Chrono Trigger: Resurrection staff | title=Project discontinued | url=http://www.opcoder.com/projects/chrono/ | publisher=Chrono Trigger: Resurrection | accessdate=May 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;remake&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Chrono Trigger Remake Project staff | title=CTRP Closes its doors | url=http://www.chrono-trigger.com/ | publisher=Chrono Trigger Remake Project | accessdate=May 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; were forcibly terminated by Square Enix by way of a [[cease and desist]] order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=2004 | author=Jones, Darran | title=games October 2004; issue 24  | publisher=Highbury Publishing | page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=2005 | author=Baker, Chris | title=Electronic Gaming Monthly February, 2005  | publisher=Ziff Davis Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=March 20, 2006 | author=Ragan, Jess | title=Singin' the Brews: The History and Philosophy of Homebrew Game Development | url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=6&amp;cId=3148820 | publisher=[[1UP.com]] | accessdate=November 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=April 17, 2006 | author=Shoemaker, Brad | title=The Greatest Games of All Time: Chrono Trigger | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6147770/index.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate=November 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group of fans created a sequel via a [[ROM hack]] of ''Chrono Trigger'' called ''[[Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes]]''; developed from 2004–2009; although feature-length and virtually finished, it also was terminated through a cease &amp; desist letter days before its May 2009 release.

=== Sequels ===
Square released a fourth Satellaview game in 1996, named ''[[Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki]]''. Feeling that ''Trigger'' ended with &quot;unfinished business&quot;, scenarist Masato Kato wrote and directed the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; ''Dreamers'' functioned as a [[side story]] to ''Chrono Trigger'', resolving a loose subplot from its predecessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklyfamitsu&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year=1999 | title=Weekly Famitsu | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Weekly_Famitsu.html | publisher=Chrono Compendium | accessdate=July 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short, [[Interactive fiction|text-based game]] relying on minimal graphics and atmospheric music, the game never received an official release outside Japan—though it was [[fan translation|translated]] by fans to English in April 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;fantranslation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | date=April 15, 2003 | title=Chrono Trigger 2: Radical Dreamers | url=http://radicaldreamers.sourceforge.net/ | publisher=Demiforce | accessdate=July 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Square planned to release ''Radical Dreamers'' as an easter egg in the PlayStation edition of ''Chrono Trigger'', but Kato was unhappy with his work and halted its inclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Chrono Cross Ultimania | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Ultimania_Developer_Interviews.html | pages=476–477 | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | isbn=4-925075-73-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Square released ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' for the Sony PlayStation in 1999.

The '''Cornwall Wildlife Trust''' is a charitable organisation founded in 1962 that is concerned solely with [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]]. 

It deals with the conservation and preservation of Cornwall's wildlife and habitats managing over 50 nature reserves covering approximately 4300 acres (17&amp;nbsp;km²), amongst them [[Looe Island]]. 

Cornwall Wildlife Trust is part of [[The Wildlife Trusts partnership]] of 47 wildlife trusts in the [[United Kingdom]]. It works in conjunction with the [[Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust]], and jointly produces a thrice yearly magazine called ''Wild Cornwall &amp; Wild Scilly''

[[Image:Cornwall Wildlife Trsut - Five Acres Reserve.jpg|400px|thumb|Five Acres Nature Reserve]]

The direction and work that the Trust currently does is guided by the Cornwall [[Biodiversity]] action plan. Living Seas and Living Landscapes are two such projects. The Trust  runs ERCCIS (Environmental Records Centre for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly), a county wide database of sightings of animals and plants. It also gives [[Land use planning|planning]] advice (CEC - Cornwall Environmental Consultants) to land developers.

The Trust is based at [[Allet]] near [[Truro]] in [[Cornwall]]. The headquarters and offices are adjacent to the Trust's '''Five Acres''' nature reserve. This reserve includes two ponds, as well as mixed broadleaved woodland.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], '''compactification''' is the process or result of making a [[topological space]] [[compact space|compact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Munkres | first=James R. | authorlink=James Munkres | title=Topology | edition=2nd | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-13-181629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of compactification are various, but each is a way of controlling points from &quot;going off to infinity&quot; by in some way adding &quot;points at infinity&quot; or preventing such an &quot;escape&quot;.

==An example==

Consider the [[real line]] with its ordinary topology. This space is not compact; in a sense, points can go off to infinity to the left or to the right. It is possible to turn the real line into a compact space by adding a single &quot;point at infinity&quot; which we will denote by ∞. The resulting compactification can be thought of as a circle (which is compact as a closed and bounded subset of the Euclidean plane). Every sequence that ran off to infinity in the real line will then converge to ∞ in this compactification.

Intuitively, the process can be pictured as follows: first shrink the real line to the [[open interval]] (-[[pi|π]],π) on the ''x''-axis; then bend the ends of this interval upwards (in positive ''y''-direction) and move them towards each other, until you get a circle with one point (the topmost one) missing. This point is our new point ∞ &quot;at infinity&quot;; adding it in completes the compact circle.

A bit more formally: we represent a point on the [[unit circle]] by its [[angle]], in [[radian]]s, going from -π to π for simplicity.  Identify each such point θ on the circle with the corresponding point on the real line [[tangent|tan]](θ/2).  This function is undefined at the point π, since tan(π/2) is undefined there; we will identify this point with our point ∞.

Since tangents and inverse tangents are both continuous, our identification function is a [[homeomorphism]] between the real line and the unit circle without ∞. What we have constructed is called the ''Alexandroff one-point compactification'' of the real line, discussed in more generality below. It is also possible to compactify the real line by adding ''two'' points, +∞ and -∞; this results in the [[extended real line]].

==Definition==

An [[embedding]] of a topological space ''X'' as a [[dense set|dense]] subset of a compact space is called a '''compactification''' of ''X''. It is often useful to embed [[topological space]]s in [[compact space]]s, because of the special properties compact spaces have.

Embeddings into compact [[Hausdorff space]]s may be of particular interest. Since every compact Hausdorff space is a [[Tychonoff space]], and every subspace of a Tychonoff space is Tychonoff, we conclude that any space possessing a Hausdorff compactification must be a Tychonoff space.  In fact, the converse is also true; being a Tychonoff space is both necessary and sufficient for possessing a Hausdorff compactification.

The fact that large and interesting classes of non-compact spaces do in fact have compactifications of particular sorts makes compactification a common technique in topology.

===Alexandroff one-point compactification===
{{main|One-point compactification}}
For any topological space ''X'' the ('''Alexandroff''') '''one-point compactification''' &amp;alpha;''X'' of ''X'' is obtained by adding one extra point ∞ (often called a ''point at infinity'') and defining the [[open set]]s of the new space to be the open sets of ''X'' together with the sets of the form ''G''&amp;nbsp;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial,Helvetica&quot;&gt;U&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;{∞}, where ''G'' is an open subset of ''X'' such that ''X'' \ ''G'' is closed and compact. The one-point compactification of ''X'' is Hausdorff if and only if ''X'' is Hausdorff and [[locally compact]].

===Stone–Čech compactification===
{{main|Stone–Čech compactification}}
Of particular interest are Hausdorff compactifications, i.e., compactifications in which the compact space is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]. A topological space has a Hausdorff compactification if and only if it is [[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]. In this case, there is a unique ([[up to]] [[homeomorphism]]) &quot;most general&quot; Hausdorff compactification, the [[Stone–Čech compactification]] of ''X'', denoted by β''X''; formally, this exhibits the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of Compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps as a [[reflective subcategory]] of the category of Tychonoff spaces and continuous maps.

&quot;Most general&quot; or formally &quot;reflective&quot; means that the space β''X'' is characterized by the [[universal property]] that any [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] function from ''X'' to a compact Hausdorff space ''K'' can be extended to a continuous function from β''X'' to ''K'' in a unique way. More explicitly, β''X'' is a compact Hausdorff space containing ''X'' such that the [[subspace topology|induced topology]] on ''X'' by β''X'' is the same as the given topology on ''X'', and for any continuous map ''f'':''X'' → ''K'', where ''K'' is a compact Hausdorff space, there is a unique continuous map ''g'':β''X'' → ''K'' for which ''g'' restricted to ''X'' is identically ''f''.

The Stone–Čech compactification can be constructed explicitly as follows: let ''C'' be the set of continuous functions from ''X'' to the closed interval [0,1].  Then each point in ''X'' can be identified with an evaluation function on ''C''.  Thus ''X'' can be identified with a subset of [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''C''&lt;/sup&gt;, the space of ''all'' functions from ''C'' to [0,1].  Since the latter is compact by [[Tychonoff's theorem]], the closure of ''X'' as a subset of that space will also be compact.  This is the Stone–Čech compactification.

==Projective space==
[[Real projective space]] '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a compactification of Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. For each possible &quot;direction&quot; in which points in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; can &quot;escape&quot;, one new point at infinity is added (but each direction is identified with its opposite). The Alexandroff one-point compactification of '''R''' we constructed in the example above is in fact homeomorphic to '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Note however that the [[projective plane]] '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is ''not'' the one-point compactification of the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; since more than one point is added.

[[Complex projective space]] '''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is also a compactification of  '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;; the Alexandroff one-point compactification of the plane '''C''' is (homeomorphic to) the complex projective line '''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which in turn can be identified with a sphere, the [[Riemann sphere]].

Passing to projective space is a common tool in [[algebraic geometry]] because the added points at infinity lead to simpler formulations of many theorems. For example, any two different lines in '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; intersect in precisely one point, a statement that is not true in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. More generally, [[Bézout's theorem]], which is fundamental in [[intersection theory (mathematics)|intersection theory]], holds in projective space but not affine space. This distinct behavior of intersections in affine space and projective space is reflected in [[algebraic topology]] in the [[cohomology ring]]s – the cohomology of affine space is trivial, while the cohomology of projective space is non-trivial and reflects the key features of intersection theory (dimension and degree of a subvariety, with intersection being [[Poincaré dual]] to the [[cup product]]).

Compactification of [[moduli space]]s generally require allowing certain degeneracies – for example, allowing certain singularities or reducible varieties. This is notably used in the Deligne–Mumford compactification of the [[Moduli of algebraic curves|moduli space of algebraic curves]].

==Compactification and discrete subgroups of Lie groups==

In the study of [[discrete space|discrete]] subgroups of [[Lie group]]s, the [[quotient space]] of [[coset]]s is often a candidate for more subtle '''compactification''' to preserve structure at a richer level than just topological. 

For example [[modular curve]]s are compactified by the addition of single points for each [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]], making them [[Riemann surface]]s (and so, since they are compact, [[algebraic curve]]s). Here the cusps are there for a good reason: the curves parametrize a space of [[lattice (group)|lattices]], and those lattices can degenerate ('go off to infinity'), often in a number of ways (taking into account some auxiliary structure of ''level''). The cusps stand in for those different 'directions to infinity'.

That is all for lattices in the plane. In ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] the same questions can be posed, for example about SO(n)\SL&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''')/SL&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z'''). This is harder to compactify. There are a variety of compactifications, such as the [[Borel-Serre compactification]], the [[reductive Borel-Serre compactification]], and the [[Satake compactifications]], that can be formed.

==Other compactification theories==

*The theories of [[end (topology)|ends of a space]] and [[prime end]]s. 
*Some 'boundary' theories such as the [[collaring of an open manifold]], [[Martin boundary]], [[Shilov boundary]] and [[Fürstenberg boundary]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[differential geometry]], one can attach to every point ''x'' of a [[smooth manifold|smooth (or differentiable) manifold]] a [[vector space]] called the '''cotangent space''' at ''x''. Typically, the cotangent space is defined as the [[dual space]] of the [[tangent space]] at ''x'', although there are more direct definitions (see below). The elements of the cotangent space are called '''cotangent vectors''' or '''tangent covectors'''.

==Properties==
All cotangent spaces on a connected manifold have the same [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]], equal to the dimension of the manifold. All the cotangent spaces of a manifold can be &quot;glued together&quot; (i.e. unioned and endowed with a topology) to form a new differentiable manifold of twice the dimension, the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold.

The tangent space and the cotangent space at a point are both real vector spaces of the same dimension and therefore [[isomorphic]] to each other via many possible isomorphisms. The introduction of a [[Riemannian metric]] or a [[symplectic form]] gives rise to a [[natural isomorphism]] between the tangent space and the cotangent space at a point, associating to any tangent covector a canonical tangent vector.

==Formal definitions==
===Definition as linear functionals===

Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''x'' be a point in ''M''. Let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' be the [[tangent space]] at ''x''. Then the cotangent space at ''x'' is defined as the [[dual space]] of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'':
:''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' = (''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
Concretely, elements of the cotangent space are [[linear functional]]s on ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''. That is, every element α ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' is a [[linear map]]
:&amp;alpha; : ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' &amp;rarr; '''F'''
where '''F''' is the underlying [[field (mathematics)|field]] of the vector space being considered. In most cases, this is the field of [[real number]]s. The elements of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' are called cotangent vectors.

===Alternative definition===

In some cases, one might like to have a direct definition of the cotangent space without reference to the tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of [[equivalence class]]es of smooth functions on ''M''. Informally, we will say that two smooth functions f and g are equivalent at a point  x if they have the same first-order behavior near x. The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near x.

Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''x'' be a point in ''M''. Let ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; be the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of all functions in C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') vanishing at ''x'', and let ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; be the set of functions of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_i f_i g_i\,&lt;/math&gt;, where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are real vector spaces and the cotangent space is defined as the [[Quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

This formulation is analogous to the construction of the cotangent space to define the [[Zariski tangent space]] in algebraic geometry. The construction also generalizes to [[locally ringed space]]s.

==The differential of a function==

Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold and let ''f'' ∈ C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') be a [[smooth function]]. The differential of ''f'' at a point ''x'' is the map
:d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'')
where ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]] at ''x'', thought of as a derivation. That is &lt;math&gt;X(f)=\mathcal{L}_Xf&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lie derivative]] of ''f'' in the direction ''X'', and one has d''f''(''X'')=''X''(''f'').  Equivalently, we can think of tangent vectors as tangents to curves, and write
:d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;gamma;&amp;prime;(0)) = (''f'' o &amp;gamma;)&amp;prime;(0)
In either case, d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is a linear map on ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' and hence it is a tangent covector at ''x''.

We can then define the differential map d : C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') → ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'' at a point ''x'' as the map which sends ''f'' to d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Properties of the differential map include:

# d is a linear map: d(''af'' + ''bg'') = ''a'' d''f'' + ''b'' d''g'' for constants ''a'' and ''b'',
# d(''fg'')&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''(''x'')d''g''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''g''(''x'')d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;,

The differential map provides the link between the two alternate definitions of the cotangent bundle given above. Given a function ''f'' ∈ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (a smooth function vanishing at ''x'') we can form the linear functional d''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; as above. Since the map d restricts to 0 on ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (the reader should verify this), d descends to a map from ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to the dual of the tangent space, (''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. One can show that this map is an isomorphism, establishing the equivalence of the two definitions.

==The pullback of a smooth map==

Just as every differentiable map ''f'' : ''M'' → ''N'' between manifolds induces a linear map (called the ''pushforward'' or ''derivative'') between the tangent spaces
:&lt;math&gt;f_{*}^{}\colon T_x M \to T_{f(x)} N&lt;/math&gt;
every such map induces a linear map (called the ''[[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]]'') between the cotangent spaces, only this time in the reverse direction:
:&lt;math&gt;f^{*}\colon T_{f(x)}^{*} N \to T_{x}^{*} M&lt;/math&gt;
The pullback is naturally defined as the dual (or transpose) of the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]]. Unraveling the definition, this means the following:
:&lt;math&gt;(f^{*}\theta)(X_x) = \theta(f_{*}^{}X_x)&lt;/math&gt;
where θ ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''f''(''x'')&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''N'' and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''. Note carefully where everything lives.

If we define tangent covectors in terms of equivalence classes of smooth maps vanishing at a point then the definition of the pullback is even more straightforward. Let ''g'' be a smooth function on ''N'' vanishing at ''f''(''x''). Then the pullback of the covector determined by ''g'' (denoted d''g'') is given by
:&lt;math&gt;f^{*}\mathrm dg = \mathrm d(g \circ f).&lt;/math&gt;
That is, it is the equivalence class of functions on ''M'' vanishing at ''x'' determined by ''g'' o ''f''.

==Exterior powers==

The ''k''-th [[exterior power]] of the cotangent space, denoted Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M''), is another important object in differential geometry. Vectors in the ''k''th exterior power, or more precisely sections of the ''k''-th exterior power of the [[cotangent bundle]], are called [[differential form|differential ''k''-forms]]. They can be thought of as alternating, [[multilinear map]]s on ''k'' tangent vectors. 
For this reason, tangent covectors are frequently called ''[[one-form]]s''.

'''Cnidaria''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|n|aɪ|ˈ|d|ɛər|i|ə}} with a [[silent letter|silent]] ''c'') is a [[Phylum (biology)|phylum]] containing over 9,000 [[species]] of [[animal]]s found exclusively in aquatic and mostly [[Ocean|marine]] environments. Their distinguishing feature is [[cnidocyte]]s, specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing prey. Their bodies consist of [[mesoglea]], a non-living jelly-like substance, sandwiched between two layers of [[epithelium]] that are mostly one [[cell (biology)|cell thick]]. They have two basic body forms: swimming [[Medusa (biology)|medusa]]e and [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[polyp]]s, both of which are [[Symmetry (biology)#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. Both forms have a single [[Body orifice|orifice]] and body cavity that are used for digestion and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Many cnidarian species produce [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] that are single organisms composed of medusa-like or polyp-like [[zooid]]s, or both. Cnidarians' activities are coordinated by a decentralized [[nerve]] net and simple receptors. Several free-swimming [[Cubozoa]] and [[Scyphozoa]] possess balance-sensing [[statocyst]]s, and some have simple eyes. Not all cnidarians [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]]. Many have complex lifecycles with [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] polyp stages and sexual medusae, but some omit either the polyp or the medusa stage.

Cnidarians were for a long time grouped with [[Ctenophore]]s in the phylum [[Coelenterata]], but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Cnidarians are classified into four main groups: the almost wholly [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[Anthozoa]] ([[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s); swimming [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish); [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies); and [[Hydrozoa]], a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and colonial swimmers such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]]. [[Staurozoa]] have recently been recognised as a [[class (biology)|class]] in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and there is debate about whether [[Myxozoa]] and [[Polypodiozoa]] are cnidarians or closer to [[bilateria]]ns (more complex animals).

Most cnidarians prey on organisms ranging in size from [[plankton]] to animals several times larger than themselves, but many obtain much of their nutrition from [[endosymbiotic]] [[algae]], and a few are [[Parasitism|parasites]]. Many are preyed upon by other animals including [[starfish]], [[Nudibranch|sea slugs]], [[fish]] and [[turtle]]s. [[Coral reef]]s, whose polyps are rich in endosymbiotic algae, support some of the world's most [[primary productivity|productive]] [[ecosystem]]s, and protect vegetation in [[tidal zone]]s and on shorelines from strong currents and tides. While corals are almost entirely restricted to warm, shallow marine waters, other cnidarians live in the depths, in [[polar region|polar]] seas and in freshwater.

Fossil cnidarians have been found in rocks formed about {{ma|580}}, and other fossils show that corals may have been present shortly before {{ma|490}} and diversified a few million years later. Fossils of cnidarians that do not build [[biomineralization|mineralized]] structures are very rare. Scientists currently think that cnidarians, ctenophores and bilaterians are more closely related to [[Calcarea|calcareous sponges]] than these are to other [[sponge]]s, and that anthozoans are the evolutionary &quot;aunts&quot; or &quot;sisters&quot; of other cnidarians, and the most closely related to bilaterians. Recent analyses have concluded that cnidarians, although considered more &quot;primitive&quot; than bilaterians, have a wider range of genes.

Jellyfish stings killed several hundred people in the 20th century, and cubozoans are particularly dangerous. On the other hand, some large jellyfish are considered a [[delicacy]] in eastern and southern [[Asia]]. Coral reefs have long been economically important as providers of fishing grounds, protectors of shore buildings against currents and tides, and more recently as centers of tourism. However, they are vulnerable to over-fishing, mining for construction materials, [[pollution]], and damage caused by tourism.

==Classification==

Cnidarians were for a long time grouped with [[Ctenophore]]s in the phylum [[Coelenterata]], but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Cnidarians are classified into four main groups: sessile [[Anthozoa]] ([[sea anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s); swimming [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish); [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies); and [[Hydrozoa]], a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and colonial swimmers such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]]. [[Staurozoa]] have recently been recognised as a [[class (biology)|class]] in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and there is debate about whether [[Myxozoa]] and [[Polypodiozoa]] are cnidarians or closer to [[bilateria]]ns.

Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four [[class (biology)|classes]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;

Stauromedusae, small [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] cnidarians with stalks and no medusa stage, have traditionally been classified as members of the Scyphozoa, but recent research suggests they should be regarded as a separate class, Staurozoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Many cnidarians are limited to shallow waters because they depend on [[endosymbiotic]] [[algae]] for much of their nutrients. The life cycles of most have polyp stages, which are limited to locations that offer stable substrates. Nevertheless major cnidarian groups contain species that have escaped these limitations. [[Hydrozoan]]s have a worldwide range: some, such as ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'', live in freshwater; ''[[Obelia]]'' appears in the coastal waters of all the oceans; and ''Liriope''&lt;!--****** at present the DAB page does not link to a cnidarian called Liriope ******--&gt; can form large shoals near the surface in mid-ocean. Among [[anthozoa]]ns, a few [[scleractinia]]n [[coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s and [[gorgonia|sea fan]]s live in deep, cold waters, and some sea anemones inhabit polar seabeds while others live near [[hydrothermal vent]]s over {{convert|10|km|mi}} below sea-level. [[Reef]]-building corals are limited to tropical seas between 30°N and 30°S with a maximum depth of {{convert|46|m|ft}}, temperatures between 20°C and 28°C, high [[salinity]] and low [[carbon dioxide]] levels. [[Stauromedusae]], although usually classified as jellyfish, are stalked, [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] animals that live in cool to [[Arctic]] waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shostak2006CnidariaInEncOfLifeSci&quot; /&gt; Cnidarians range in size from ''Hydra'', {{convert|5|-|20|mm|in}} long,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sea anemones and jellyfish have a [[symbiotic]] relationship with some fish; for example [[clown fish]] live among the tentacles of sea anemones, and each partner protects the other against predators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shostak2006CnidariaInEncOfLifeSci&quot; /&gt;

[[Coral reef]]s form some of the world's most productive ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both Anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals) The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective [[primary productivity|primary producers]], in other words converters of [[inorganic]] chemicals into [[Organic compound|organic]] ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support a wide range of other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarnesMann1991AquaticEcology&quot;&gt;{{cite book

This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History==

Fossil cnidarians have been found in rocks formed about {{ma|580}}, and other fossils show that corals may have been present shortly before {{ma|490}} and diversified a few million years later. Fossils of cnidarians that do not build [[biomineralization|mineralized]] structures are very rare. Scientists currently think that cnidarians, ctenophores and bilaterians are more closely related to [[Calcarea|calcareous sponges]] than these are to other [[sponge]]s, and that anthozoans are the evolutionary &quot;aunts&quot; or &quot;sisters&quot; of other cnidarians, and the most closely related to bilaterians. Recent analyses have concluded that cnidarians, although considered more &quot;primitive&quot; than bilaterians, have a wider range of genes.

==Distinguishing features==
{{see|Sponge|Ctenophore|Bilateria}}
Cnidarians form an [[animal]] [[phylum]] that is more complex than [[sponge]]s, about as complex as [[ctenophore]]s (comb jellies), and less complex than [[bilateria]]ns, which include almost all other animals. However, both cnidarians and ctenophores are more complex than sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell connections and carpet-like [[basement membrane]]s; [[muscle]]s; [[nervous system]]s; and '''some''' have [[sensory receptor|sensory]] organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all other animals by having [[cnidocyte]]s that fire like [[harpoon]]s and are used mainly to capture prey but also as anchors in some species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot;&gt;{{cite book

| editor=Anderson, D.T.,| title=Invertebrate Zoology| publisher=Oxford University Press
| isbn=0195513681
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like sponges and ctenophores, cnidarians have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly-like material, which is called the [[mesoglea]] in cnidarians; more complex [[animal]]s have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer. Hence, cnidarians and ctenophores have traditionally been labelled [[diploblastic]], along with sponges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt; However, both cnidarians and ctenophores have a type of [[muscle]] that, in more complex animals, arises from the [[mesoderm|middle cell layer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SeipelSchmid2005EvolutionOfStriatedMuscle&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result some recent text books classify ctenophores as [[triploblastic]],&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004Ctenophora&quot; /&gt; and it has been suggested that cnidarians evolved from triploblastic ancestors.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeipelSchmid2005EvolutionOfStriatedMuscle&quot;/&gt;

==Description==
===Main cell layers===
Cnidaria are [[diploblastic]] animals, in other words they have two main cell layers, while more complex animals are [[triploblast]]s having three main layers. The two main cell layers of cnidarians form [[epithelia]] that are mostly one cell thick, and are attached to a fibrous [[basement membrane]], which they [[secrete]]. They also secrete the jelly-like [[mesoglea]] that separates the layers. The layer that faces outwards, known as the [[ectoderm]] (&quot;outside skin&quot;), generally contains the following types of cells:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;
*Epitheliomuscular cells whose bodies form part of the epithelium but whose bases extend to form [[muscle]] fibers in parallel rows.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004MuscleTissue&quot;&gt;{{cite book
| author=Ruppert, E.E., Fox, R.S., and Barnes, R.D.| title=Invertebrate Zoology
| publisher=Brooks / Cole| edition=7| isbn=0030259827| year=2004| pages=103–104| chapter=Introduction to Metazoa
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fibers of the outward-facing cell layer generally run at right angles to the fibers of the inward-facing one. In [[Anthozoa]] (anemones, corals, etc.) and [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish), the mesoglea also contains some muscle cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot;&gt;{{cite book
| author=Ruppert, E.E., Fox, R.S., and Barnes, R.D.| title=Invertebrate Zoology
| publisher=Brooks / Cole| edition=7| isbn=0030259827| year=2004| pages=111–124
}}&lt;/ref&gt;                                                
*[[Cnidocyte]]s, the harpoon-like &quot;[[nettle]] cells&quot; that give the [[phylum]] Cnidaria its name. These appear between or sometimes on top of the muscle cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;
*[[Nerve]] cells. [[Sensory neuron|Sensory]] cells appear between or sometimes on top of the muscle cells,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt; and communicate via [[synapse]]s (gaps across which chemical signals flow) with [[motor nerve]] cells, which lie mostly between the bases of the muscle cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;
*Interstitial cells, which are unspecialized and can replace lost or damaged cells by transforming into the appropriate types. These are found between the bases of muscle cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;

In addition to epitheliomuscular, nerve and interstitial cells, the inward-facing [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]] (&quot;stomach skin&quot;) contains [[gland]] cells that secrete digestive [[enzyme]]s. In some species it also contains low concentrations of cnidocytes, which are used to subdue prey that is still struggling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

The mesoglea contains small numbers of [[amoeba (genus)|amoeba]]-like cells,&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt; and muscle cells in some species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt; However the number of middle-layer cells and types are much lower than in sponges.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

===Cnidocytes===
[[Image:Hydra nematocyst 01.png|thumb| right| 200px| A [[hydra (genus)|hydra]]'s nematocyst, before firing.&lt;br&gt;{{colorbox|#00b900}} &quot;trigger&quot; cilium&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;]]

These &quot;nettle cells&quot; function as [[harpoon]]s, since their [[Wikt:payload|payload]]s remain connected to the bodies of the cells by threads. Three types of [[cnidocyte]]s are known:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;
*[[Nematocyst]]s inject [[venom]] into prey, and usually have barbs to keep them embedded in the victims. Most species have nematocysts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;
*[[Spirocyst]]s do not penetrate the victim or inject venom, but entangle it by means of small sticky hairs on the thread. Only members of the [[class (biology)|class]] [[Anthozoa]] ([[sea anemone]]s and [[coral]]s) have spirocysts.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;
*[[Ptychocyst]]s are not used for prey capture — instead the threads of discharged ptychocysts are used for building protective tubes in which their owners live. Ptychocysts are found only in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Cerianthria]], [[Tube-dwelling anemone|tube anemones]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

The main components of a cnidocyte are:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;
*A [[cilium]] (fine hair) which projects above the surface and acts as a trigger. Spirocysts do not have cilia.
*A tough capsule, the [[cnida]], which houses the thread, its payload and a mixture of chemicals which may include venom or [[adhesive]]s or both. (&quot;cnida&quot; is derived from the Greek word κνίδη, which means &quot;nettle&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary| contribution=Cnida
| author=Trumble, W., and Brown, L.
| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2002
}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*A tube-like extension of the wall of the cnida that points into the cnida, like the finger of a rubber glove pushed inwards. When a cnidocyte fires, the finger pops out. If the cell is a venomous nematocyte, the &quot;finger&quot;'s tip reveals a set of barbs that anchor it in the prey.
*The thread, which is an extension of the &quot;finger&quot; and coils round it until the cnidocyte fires. The thread is usually hollow and delivers chemicals from the cnida to the target.
*An [[Operculum (animal)|operculum]] (lid) over the end of the cnida. The lid may be a single hinged flap or three flaps arranged like slices of pie.
*The cell body which produces all the other parts.

It is difficult to study the firing mechanisms of cnidocytes as these structures are small but very complex. At least four hypotheses have been proposed:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;
*Rapid contraction of fibers round the cnida may increase its internal pressure.
*The thread may be like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released.
*In the case of ''[[Chironex]]'' (the &quot;sea wasp&quot;), chemical changes in the cnida's contents may cause them to expand rapidly by [[polymerization]].
*Chemical changes in the liquid in the cnida make it a much more [[concentration|concentrated]] solution, so that [[osmotic pressure]] forces water in very rapidly to dilute it. This mechanism has been observed in nematocysts of the class [[Hydrozoa]], sometimes producing pressures as high as 140 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]], similar to that of [[Scuba set|scuba]] air tanks, and fully extending the thread in as little as 2&amp;nbsp;milliseconds (0.002&amp;nbsp;second).&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

Cnidocytes can only fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when capturing a [[brine shrimp]]. Used cnidocytes have to be replaced, which takes about 48&amp;nbsp;hours. To minimise wasteful firing, two types of stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: their cilia detect contact, and nearby [[sensory neuron|sensory]] cells &quot;smell&quot; chemicals in the water. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, the rest of the group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Actinodiscus macro.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Oral end of [[actinodiscus]] polyp, with close-up of the mouth]]
Adult cnidarians appear as either swimming [[Medusa (biology)|medusa]]e or [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[polyp]]s. Both are [[Symmetry (biology)#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]], like a wheel and a tube respectively. Since these animals have no heads, their ends are described as &quot;oral&quot; (nearest the mouth) and &quot;aboral&quot; (furthest from the mouth). Most have fringes of tentacles equipped with cnidocytes around their edges, and medusae generally have an inner ring of tentacles around the mouth. The mesoglea of polyps is usually thin and often soft, but that of medusae is usually thick and springy, so that it returns to its original shape after muscles around the edge have contracted to squeeze water out, enabling medusae to swim by a sort of jet propulsion.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

===Colonial forms===
[[Image:Cnidaria polyp tree colony 01.png|thumb|right| 100px| Tree-like polyp colony&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;]]
Cnidaria produce a variety of colonial forms, each of which is one organism but consists of polyp-like [[wikt:zooid|zooids]]. The simplest is a connecting tunnel that runs over the substrate (rock or seabed) and from which single zooids sprout. In some cases the tunnels form visible webs, and in others they are enclosed in a fleshy mat. More complex forms are also based on connecting tunnels but produce &quot;tree-like&quot; groups of zooids. The &quot;trees&quot; may be formed either by a central zooid that functions as a &quot;trunk&quot; with later zooids growing to the sides as &quot;branches&quot;, or in a zig-zag shape as a succession of zooids, each of which grows to full size and then produces a single bud at an angle to itself. In many cases the connecting tunnels and the &quot;stems&quot; are covered in periderm, a protective layer of [[chitin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt; Some colonial forms have other specialized types of zooid, for example, to pump water through their tunnels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shostak2006CnidariaInEncOfLifeSci&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

| title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences| publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons| year=2006| doi=10.1038/npg.els.0004117
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Siphonophore]]s form complex colonies that consist of: an upside-down polyp that forms a central stem with a gas-filled float at the top; one or more sets of medusa-like zooids that provide propulsion; leaf-like bracts that give some protection to other parts; sets of tentacles that bear nematocytes that capture prey; other tentacles that act as sensors; near the base of each set of tentacles, a polyp-like zooid that acts as a stomach for the colony; medusa-like zooids that serve as [[gonad]]s. Although some of these zooids resemble polyps or medusae in shape, they lack features that are not relevant to their specific functions, for example the swimming &quot;medusae&quot; have no digestive, sensory or reproductive cells. The best-known siphonophore is the [[Portuguese Man o' War]] (''Physalia physalis'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Shostak2006CnidariaInEncOfLifeSci&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BhamrahJuneja2002Invertebrates&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skeletons===
In medusae the only supporting structure is the [[mesoglea]]. ''[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and most [[sea anemone]]s close their mouths when they are not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as ''[[Tubularia]]'' use columns of water-filled cells for support. [[Sea pen]]s stiffen the mesoglea with [[calcium carbonate]] [[spicule]]s and tough fibrous [[protein]]s, rather like [[sponge]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

In some colonial polyps a [[chitin]]ous [[periderm]] gives support and some protection to the connecting sections and to the lower parts of individual polyps. [[Coral#Hermatype corals|Stony coral]]s secrete massive calcium carbonate [[exoskeleton]]s. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with [[sediment]] particles.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

===Locomotion===
[[Image:Chrysaora quinquecirrha-Sea nettle (jellyfish).ogg|thumb| right| 200px| ''[[Chrysaora quinquecirrha]]'' (&quot;sea nettle&quot;) swimming]]
Medusae swim by a form of jet propulsion: muscles, especially inside the rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]s and some [[sea anemone]]s can move slowly over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means: creeping like snails, crawling like [[Geometer moth|inchworm]]s, or by [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|somersault]]ing. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

===Nervous system and senses===
Cnidaria have no [[brain]]s or even [[central nervous system]]s. Instead they have decentralized [[nerve net]]s consisting of : [[sensory neuron]]s that generate signals in response to various types of stimulus, such as [[Olfaction|odor]]s; [[motor neuron]]s that tell muscles to contract; all connected by &quot;cobwebs&quot; of intermediate neurons. As well as forming the &quot;signal cables&quot;, intermediate neurons also form [[ganglia]] that act as local coordination centers. The [[cilia]] of the [[cnidocyte]]s detect physical contact. Nerves inform cnidocytes when odors from prey or attackers are detected and when neighbouring cnidocytes fire. Most of the communications between nerve cells are via [[chemical synapse]]s, small gaps across which chemicals flow. As this process is too slow to ensure that the muscles round the rim of a medusa's bell contract simultaneously in swimming the neurons which control this communicate by much faster electrical signals across [[gap junction]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

Medusae and complex swimming colonies such as [[siphonophore]]s and [[chondrophore]]s sense tilt and acceleration by means of [[statocyst]]s, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called [[statolith]]s. If the body tilts in the wrong direction, the animal rights itself by increasing the strength of the swimming movements on the side that is too low. They also have [[ocelli]] (&quot;little eyes&quot;), which can detect the direction from which light is coming. [[Cubozoa|Box jellies]] have [[camera eye]]s, although these probably do not form images, and their [[Lens (optics)|lens]]es simply produce a clearer indication of the direction from which light is coming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;

===Feeding and excretion===
Cnidarians feed in several ways: [[predation]], absorbing dissolved [[organic matter|organic]] chemicals, [[filter feeding|filtering]] food particles out of the water, and obtaining nutrients from [[symbiotic]] [[algae]] within their cells. Most obtain the majority of their food from predation but some, including the [[coral]]s ''[[Hetroxenia]]'' and ''[[Leptogorgia]]'', depend almost completely on their [[endosymbiont]]s and on absorbing dissolved nutrients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt; Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae [[carbon dioxide]], some nutrients and a place in the sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

Predatory species use their [[cnidocyte]]s to poison or entangle prey, and those with venomous [[nematocyst]]s  may start digestion by injecting digestive [[enzyme]]s. The &quot;smell&quot; of fluids from wounded prey makes the tentacles fold inwards and wipe the prey off into the mouth. In medusae the tentacles round the edge of the bell are often short and most of the prey capture is done by &quot;oral arms&quot;, which are extensions of the edge of the mouth and are often frilled and sometimes branched to increase their surface area. Medusae often trap prey or suspended food particles by swimming upwards, spreading their tentacles and oral arms and then sinking. In species for which suspended food particles are important, the tentacles and oral arms often have rows of [[cilia]] whose beating creates currents that flow towards the mouth, and some produce nets of [[mucus]] to trap particles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;

Once the food is in the digestive cavity, [[gland]] cells in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]] release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach all parts of the digestive cavity.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt; Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by [[diffusion]] or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick [[mesoglea]]s, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;

Indigestible remains of prey are expelled through the mouth. The main waste product of cells' internal processes is [[ammonia]], which is removed by the external and internal water currents.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

===Respiration===

There are no respiratory organs, and both cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel [[carbon dioxide]] into the surrounding water. When the water in the digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with it. Some [[Anthozoa]] have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;

Cnidaria that carry [[photosynthetic]] [[symbiont]]s may have the opposite problem, an excess of oxygen, which may prove [[Oxygen toxicity|toxic]]. The animals produce large quantities of [[antioxidant]]s to neutralize the excess oxygen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;

===Regeneration===
All cnidarians can [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]], allowing them to recover from injury and to reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]]. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;

===Sexual===
In the Cnidaria [[sexual reproduction]] often involves a complex life cycle with both [[polyp]] and [[Medusa (biology)|medusa]] stages. For example in [[Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish) and [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) a [[larva]] swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally into a series of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called [[strobilation]]. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have [[gonad]]s in the [[gastrodermis|gastroderm]], and these release [[ovum|ova]] and [[sperm]] into the water in the breeding season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

Shortened forms of this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. [[Hydrozoa]] have a variety of life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. ''[[hydra (genus)|hydra]]'') have no medusae. In some species the medusae remain attached to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. [[Anthozoa]] have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;

Spawning is generally driven by environmental factors such as changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the [[Lunar phase|phase of the moon]]. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, so that there are too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage — one famous example is the [[Great Barrier Reef]], where at least 110 [[coral]]s and a few non-cnidarian [[invertebrate]]s produce enough to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;

The fertilized eggs develop into larvae by dividing until there are enough cells to form a hollow sphere ([[blastula]]) and then a depression forms at one end ([[gastrulation]]) and eventually become the digestive cavity. However in cnidarians the depression forms at the end further from the yolk (at the [[animal pole]]), while in [[bilaterian]]s it forms at the other end ([[vegetal pole]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt; The larvae, called [[planula]]e, swim or crawl by means of [[cilia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt; They are cigar-shaped but slightly broader at the &quot;front&quot; end, which is the aboral, vegetal-pole end and eventually attaches to a substrate if the species has a polyp stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

Anthozoan larvae either have large [[yolk]]s or are capable of feeding on [[plankton]], and some already have [[endosymbiotic]] [[algae]] that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding capabilities extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and [[metamorphose]] into polyps. Instead these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

===Asexual===
All known cnidaria can reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] by various means, in addition to regenerating after being fragmented. [[Hydrozoa]]n polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. [[Scyphozoa]]n polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, [[Anthozoa]] can split horizontally just above the base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinde2001CnidariaAndCtenophoraInAnderson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertBarnes2004CnidariaGeneral&quot; /&gt;

It is difficult to reconstruct the early stages in the [[evolution]]ary &quot;family tree&quot; of animals using only [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] (their shapes and structures), because the large differences between [[Porifera]] (sponges), Cnidaria plus [[Ctenophora]] (comb jellies), [[Placozoa]] and [[Bilateria]] (all the more complex animals) make comparisons difficult.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866 it was proposed that Cnidaria and Ctenophora were more closely related to each other than to Bilateria and formed a group called [[Coelenterata]] (&quot;hollow guts&quot;), because Cnidaria and Ctenophora both rely on the flow of water in and out of a single cavity for feeding, excretion and respiration. In 1881 it was proposed that Ctenophora and Bilateria were more closely related to each other, since they shared features that Cnidaria lack, for example muscles in the middle layer ([[mesoglea]] in Ctenophora, [[mesoderm]] in Bilateria). However more recent analyses indicate that these similarities are rather vague, and the current view, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that Cnidaria and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to Ctenophora. This grouping of Cnidaria and Bilateria has been labelled &quot;[[Planulozoa]]&quot; because it suggests that the earliest Bilateria were similar to the [[planula]] larvae of Cnidaria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Within the Cnidaria, the Anthozoa (sea anemones and corals) are regarded as the sister-group of the rest, which suggests that the earliest cnidarians were [[sessility (zoology)|sessile]] polyps with no medusa stage. However it is unclear how the other groups acquired the medusa stage, since [[Hydrozoa]] form medusae by budding from the side of the polyp while the other Medusozoa do so by splitting them off from the tip of the polyp. The traditional grouping of [[Scyphozoa]] included the [[Staurozoa]], but morphology and molecular phylogenetics indicate that Staurozoa are more closely related to [[Cubozoa]] (box jellies) than to other &quot;Scyphozoa&quot;. Similarities in the double body walls of Staurozoa and the extinct [[Conulariida]] suggest that they are closely related. The position of Anthozoa nearest the beginning of the cnidarian family tree also implies that Anthozoa are the cnidarians most closely related to Bilateria, and this is supported by the fact that Anthozoa and Bilateria share some genes that determine the main [[Axis of symmetry|axes]] of the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins2002PhylogenyOfMedusozoa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

However in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid suggested that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of [[triploblastic]] animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have [[striated muscle]], which in bilaterians arises from the [[mesoderm]]. They did not commit themselves on whether bilaterians evolved from early cnidarians or from the hypothesized triploblastic ancestors of cnidarians.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeipelSchmid2005EvolutionOfStriatedMuscle&quot; /&gt;

Coral reefs have long been economically important as providers of fishing grounds, protectors of shore buildings against currents and tides, and more recently as centers of tourism. However, they are vulnerable to over-fishing, mining for construction materials, [[pollution]], and damage caused by tourism.

Beaches protected from tides and storms by [[coral reef]]s are often the best places for housing in tropical countries. Reefs are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on the reefs themselves and in the adjacent seas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark1998CoastalSeas&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Some large [[jellyfish]] species have been used in [[Chinese cuisine]] at least since 200&amp;nbsp;[[AD]], and are now fished in the seas around most of [[South East Asia]]. [[Japan]] is the largest single consumer of edible jellyfish, importing at first only from China but now from all of South East Asia as prices rose in the 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Conservative Judaism''' (also known as '''Masorti Judaism''' outside of the United States and Canada) is a modern [[Jewish denominations|stream]] of [[Judaism]] that arose out of intellectual currents in [[Germany]] in the mid-19th century and took institutional form in the [[United States]] in the early 1900s.
{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|denominations}}

Conservative Judaism has its roots in the school of thought known as Positive-Historical Judaism, developed in 1850s [[Germany]] as a reaction to the more liberal religious positions taken by [[Reform Judaism]]. The term ''conservative'' was meant to signify that Jews should attempt to ''conserve'' Jewish tradition, rather than reform or abandon it, and does not imply the movement's adherents are [[conservative (politics)|politically conservative]]. Because of this potential for confusion, a number of Conservative Rabbis have proposed renaming the movement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/28124/format/html/displaystory.html &quot;In what Direction is the Conservative Movement Headed&quot;, ''Jewish News Weekly of Northern California'', January 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; and outside of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], in many countries including Israel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masorti.org/ Masorti Movement in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masorti.org.uk/ Assembly of Masorti Synagogues]&lt;/ref&gt; it is today known as ''Masorti'' Judaism (Hebrew for &quot;Traditional&quot;).

In the United States and Canada, the term ''Conservative'', as applied, does not always indicate that a congregation is affliliated with the [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]], the movement's central institution and the one to which the term, without qualifier, usually refers. Rather, it is sometimes employed by unaffiliated groups to indicate a range of beliefs and practices more liberal than is affirmed by the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], and more traditional than the more liberal [[Jewish denominations]] ([[Reform Judaism (United States)|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]]). In Canada, several congregations belong to the [[Canadian Council of Conservative Synagogues]] instead of the United Synagogue. The moniker [[Conservadox]] is sometimes employed to refer to the right wing of the Conservative spectrum, although &quot;Traditional&quot; is used as well (as in the [[Union for Traditional Judaism]]).

==Organizational structure==
The Conservative-Masorti movement is unified on a global level by [[Masorti Olami]], representing affiliated congregations in the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Masorti Olami unites a number of smaller national and regional organizations, including:

*The [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]] (USCJ) in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]],
*The [[Assembly of Masorti Synagogues]] in the [[United Kingdom]],
*[[Masorti Europe]] in [[Europe]],
*[[Masorti AmLat]] in [[Latin America]],

The international association of Conservative/Masorti Rabbis is known as the [[Rabbinical Assembly]]; the [[Cantors Assembly]] is the organization of [[chazan]]im. The global youth movement is known as [[NOAM]] (an acronym for No'ar Masorti); its North American chapter is called the [[United Synagogue Youth]]. The movement maintains numerous [[Conservative Judaism#Educational institutions|Rabbinical seminaries and other educational institutions]].

==History==
Like [[Reform Judaism]], the Conservative movement developed in Europe and the United States in the 19th century, as Jews reacted to the changes brought about by the [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Jewish emancipation]]--a confluence of events which lead to [[Haskalah]], or the Jewish Enlightenment. In Europe the movement was known as Positive-Historical Judaism, and it is still known as &quot;the historical school.&quot;

===Historical antecedents===
Positive-Historical Judaism, the intellectual forerunner to Conservative Judaism, was developed as a school of thought in the 1840s and 1850s in [[Germany]]. Its principal founder was [[Rabbi]] [[Zecharias Frankel]], who had broken with the German [[Reform Judaism]] in 1845 over its rejection of the primacy of the Hebrew language in Jewish prayer and the rejection of the laws of kashrut. In 1854, Frankel became the head of the Jewish Theological Seminary of [[Wrocław|Breslau]] (then in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], now [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]). At the seminary, Frankel taught that [[halakha|Jewish law]] was not static, but rather has always developed in response to changing conditions. He called his approach towards Judaism &quot;Positive-Historical,&quot; which meant that one should have a positive attitude towards accepting Jewish law and tradition as [[norm (sociology)|normative]], yet one should be open to developing the law in the same fashion that it has always historically developed. Frankel rejected the innovations of [[Reform Judaism]] as insufficiently based in Jewish history and communal practice. However, Frankel's use of modern methods of historical scholarship in analyzing Jewish texts and developing Jewish law set him apart from [[Torah im Derech Eretz|neo-Orthodox]] Judaism, which was concurrently developing under the leadership of Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].

===United States===
The differences between the more modern and traditional branches of American Judaism came to a head in 1883, at the &quot;Trefa Banquet&quot; at the [[Mount Adams, Ohio|Highland House entertainment pavilion]], which was at the top of the [[Mount Adams Incline]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanjewisharchives.org/journal/PDF/2005pp29-52%20Myth%20of%20Trefa.pdf 2005AjajFinal.indb&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cincinnativiews.net/cablecars%20inclines.htm Cablecars/Inclines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; – where [[shellfish]] and other non-[[kosher]] dishes were served at the celebration of the first graduating class of [[Hebrew Union College]] in Cincinnati. The adoption of the radical [[Pittsburgh Platform]] in 1885, which dismissed observance of the ritual commandments and [[Jewish peoplehood]] as &quot;anachronistic&quot;, created a permanent wedge between the Reform movement and more traditional American Jews.

[[Image:Sabato morais.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of '''Sabato Morais''', from the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia.]]
In 1886, prominent Sephardic Rabbis [[Sabato Morais]] and [[Henry Pereira Mendes|H. Pereira Mendes]] founded the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] (JTS) in New York City as a more traditional alternative to Hebrew Union College. The Seminary's brief affiliation with the traditional congregations that established the [[Orthodox Union|Union of Orthodox Congregations]] in 1898 was severed due to the Orthodox rejection of the Seminary's academic approach to Jewish learning. At the turn of the century, the Seminary lacked a source of permanent funding and was ordaining on average no more than one Rabbi per year.

This situation was resolved due to the efforts of [[Cyrus Adler]], professor of Semitic languages at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and founder of the [[Jewish Publication Society]], who convinced a number of wealthy [[German Reform movement (Judaism)|German Reform Jews]] including [[Jacob Schiff]], [[David Guggenheim|David]] and [[Simon Guggenheim]], [[Mayer Sulzberger]], and [[Louis Marshall]], to contribute $500,000 to the faltering JTS.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''The Jews in America''. New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solomon Schechter.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Solomon Schechter inspecting texts from the Cairo Genizah in Cambridge.]]
The fortunes of Conservative Judaism underwent a dramatic turnaround when in 1902, the famed scholar [[Solomon Schechter]], lecturer in Talmud at the [[University of Cambridge]], accepted the invitation to become president of JTS. Under Schechter's leadership, JTS attracted a distinguished faculty, including [[Louis Ginzberg]] (author of ''Legends of the Jews''), historian [[Alexander Marx]], Arabist [[Israel Friedlander]], and future founder of Reconstructionism [[Mordecai Kaplan]], and became a highly regarded center of Jewish learning.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In 1913, the Conservative Movement founded its congregational arm, the United Synagogue of America, which would later become the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism.

Conservative Judaism enjoyed rapid growth in the first half of the 20th century, becoming the largest American Jewish denomination. Its combination of modern innovation (such as mixed gender seating) and traditional practice particularly appealed to first and second-generation Eastern European Jewish immigrants, who found Orthodoxy too restrictive, but Reform Judaism foreign. After [[World War II]], Conservative Judaism continued to thrive. The 1950s and early 1960s featured a boom in [[synagogue]] construction as upwardly mobile American Jews moved to the [[suburb]]s. Conservative Judaism occupied an enviable middle position during a period where American society prized consensus.

By the 1990s Conservative Judaism continued to flourish, yet dichotomies of practice and belief, which had been present for years, began to formulate. After a substantial gift from [[Los Angeles]] philanthropist Ruth Ziegler, a new rabbinical school was formed at the [[American Jewish University]] ''(then University of Judaism)'' in [[Bel Air, California|Bel Air]], California. Established in 1996, the [[Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies]] became the first independent [[Jewish]] [[seminary]] to be established on the west coast. In 2001, all graduates of the Zieger School were formally admitted as members of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]].

Working with this 1990s trend of diversity and institutional growth, Conservative Judaism remained the largest denomination in America, with 43 percent of Jewish households affiliated with a synagogue belonging to Conservative synagogues (compared to 35 percent for Reform and 16 percent for Orthodox). In 2000, the NJPS showed that only 33 percent of synagogue-affiliated American Jews belonged to a Conservative synagogue. For the first time in nearly a century, Conservative Judaism is no longer the largest denomination in America. At the same time, however, certain Conservative institutions, particularly day schools, have shown significant growth. Conservative leaders agree that these contrasting trends indicate that the movement has reached a crossroads as it heads into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/11511/ Jewish Daily Forward: Conservative Judaism at a Crossroads]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Schisms====
The first split in the Conservative coalition occurred in 1963, when followers of [[Mordecai Kaplan]] seceded from the movement to form a distinct [[Reconstructionist Judaism]]. Kaplan had been a leading figure at JTS for 54 years, and had pressed for liturgical reform and innovations in ritual practice from inside of the framework of Conservative Judaism. Frustrated by the perceived dominance of the more traditionalist voices at JTS, Kaplan's followers decided that the ideas of Reconstructionism would be better served through the creation of a separate denomination. In 1968, the split became formalized with the establishment of the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]].

Another schism in the Conservative ranks, this time from the movement's right wing, would come when a number of the traditionalist Rabbis led by JTS Talmudics professor [[David Weiss Halivni]] split from the United Synagogue to form the [[Union for Traditional Judaism]]. The dissenters were discontented with the general leftward trend in USCJ policies over the previous decades, such as &quot;prayer book revision, egalitarianism, redefining halakhic boundaries of sexual relationships, and advocacy of Israel accepting conversions that are non-halakhic even by Conservative standards&quot;.,&lt;ref name=&quot;utj.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.utj.org/faq#q7 Union for Traditional Judaism FAQ, What Distinguishes the UTJ from the Conservative movement?]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Union suggests that &quot;The Conservative Movement thus appears to endorse the notion that changing societal norms can supersede the proper application of halakhic sources&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;utj.org&quot;/&gt; The Union today describes itself as &quot;trans-denominational&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utj.org/faq#q1 Union for Traditional Judaism FAQ, What is the Union for Traditional Judaism]&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains a Rabbinical seminary, the [[Institute for Traditional Judaism]].

===United Kingdom===
[[Image:Rabbijacobs.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Rabbi Dr. Louis Jacobs]]
The Masorti movement did not establish a presence in the United Kingdom until much later and came about largely because of a series of incidents known colletively as the &quot;Jacobs affair&quot;: Rabbi Louis Jacobs, a leading scholar of [[History of the Jews in England|Anglo Jewery]], joined the faculty of the [[Jews College]], leaving his post as Rabbi of the [[New West End Synagogue]], under the impression that he would eventually be made principal.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of the Masorti Movement&quot;&gt;[http://www.masorti.org.uk/history_of_the_masorti_movement.htm History of the Masorti Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1962 the [[London Beth Din]] and the [[List of Chief Rabbis of the United Kingdom|Chief Rabbi]] [[Israel Brodie]], who formed the leadership of the [[United Synagogue]], the UK's Orthodox establishment, refused to allow his appointment on grounds of [[Heresy in Orthodox Judaism|heresy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;History of the Masorti Movement&quot;/&gt; because in his 1957 book ''[[We Have Reason to Believe]]'', Jacobs had rejected the conception of a literal, verbal revelation of the Torah. In 1964, when the committee of the New West End Synagogue wanted to reappoint Jacobs as their rabbi, Brodie again vetoed his appointment on the same grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of the Masorti Movement&quot;/&gt; In response, Jacobs and many of the New West End congregants established the [[New London Synagogue]], which became the center of Masorti Judaism in the United Kingdom.

In the United Kingdom, congregational observance is somewhat more traditional than in the United States. There are no female Rabbis among the British Masorti, for example, and some Masorti congegations maintain non-egalitarian practices with regard to gender, such as the [[mechitza]] and the prohibition of women reading from the Torah,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masorti.org.uk/frequently_asked_questions.htm#WOMEN_IN_THE_SYNAGOGUE Women in the Synagogue]&lt;/ref&gt; while nearly all American congregations are fully egalitarian and the American Rabbinical schools ordain women as Rabbis.

There are now 13 Masorti congregations in the United Kingdom. Most Masorti Rabbis are trained at [[Leo Baeck College]], an inter-denominational seminary which ordains non-Orthodox British Rabbis.

===Israel===
[[Image:Masorti logo.png|thumb|100px|left|Logo of the Masorti movement in Israel.]]
The first Masorti communities in the [[State of Israel]] were founded in 1979 by North American [[olim]]. The movement now has some 50 congregations in Israel, with a membership of approximately 50,000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070522000543/http://www.masorti.org/about/about.html The Masorti Movement in Israel, About]&lt;/ref&gt; and its progams reach some 125,000 each year. In addition to its kehillot and chavurot maintains a [[kibbutz]] ([[Kibbutz Hanaton]]), a [[moshav]] ([[Moshav Shorashim]]), and IDF Garinim, Masorti groups within the [[Israeli Defense Forces]]. The organization is active in integrating olim from South America and the former Soviet Union into Israeli society--[[Sabra (person)|native Israelis]] and olim from non-English speaking countries now make up about 60% of the Israeli Masorti population, the remaining 40% are North American olim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070519072540/http://www.masorti.org/about/faqs.html Masorti Judaism in Israel, FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is supported by the Masorti Foundation for Conservative Judaism in Israel, an American organization which provides funding to Masorti programs, which are disadvantaged by the Israeli government's practice of funding only Orthodox institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070519072540/http://www.masorti.org/about/faqs.html The Masorti Movement in Israel, FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
In 1988, the [[Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism]] issued an official statement of belief, ''Emet Ve-Emunah: Statement of Principles of Conservative Judaism''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ve-Emunah-1990&quot;&gt;[http://www.icsresources.org/content/primarysourcedocs/ConservativeJudaismPrinciples.pdf Emet Ve-Emunah, Statement of Principles of Conservative Judaism], second Printing, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; ''Emet Ve-Emunah'' affirms belief in God and in the divine inspiration of the [[Torah]]; however, it also affirms the legitimacy of multiple interpretations of these issues. [[Atheism]], [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] views of God, and [[polytheism]] are ruled out. Conservative Judaism rejects both [[relativism]] and [[fundamentalism]]. The commission found that there were seven main beliefs shared by representatives from different part of the movement:&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gordis, &quot;Introduction&quot; to [http://www.icsresources.org/content/primarysourcedocs/ConservativeJudaismPrinciples.pdf Emet Ve-Emunah, Statement of Principles of Conservative Judaism], second Printing (1990) pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

: &quot;In the beginning God …&quot; Though we differ in our perceptions and experiences of reality, we affirm our faith in '''[[God]]''' as the Creator and Governor of the universe. His power called the world into being; His wisdom and goodness guide its destiny. Of all the living creatures we know, humanity alone, created in His image and endowed with free will, has been singled out to be the recipient and bearer of Revelation. The product of this human-divine encounter is the Torah, the embodiment of God's will revealed pre-eminently to the Jewish people through Moses, the Prophets and the Sages, as well as to the righteous and wise of all nations. Hence, by descent and destiny, each Jew stands under the divine command to obey God's will.

: Second, we recognize the authority of the '''[[Halakhah]]''' which has never been monolithic or immovable. On the contrary, as modern scholarship has abundantly demonstrated, the Halakhah has grown and developed through changing times and diverse circumstances. This life-giving attribute is doubly needed today in a world of dizzying change.

: Third, though the term was unknown, '''[[Value pluralism|pluralism]]''' has characterized Jewish life and thought through the ages. This is reflected in the variety of views and attitudes of the biblical legislators, priests, prophets, historians, psalmists and Wisdom teachers, the hundreds of controversies among the rabbis of the Talmud and in the codes and responsa of their successors. The latter-day attempt to suppress freedom of inquiry and the right to dissent is basically a foreign importation into Jewish life.

: Fourth, the rich body of [[Halakhah]] and [[Aggadah]] and the later [[Jewish philosophy|philosophic]] and [[Kabbalah|mystical]] literature, all seeking to come closer to God's presence, are a precious resource for deepening the spiritual life of Israel and humankind.

: Fifth, all the aspects of Jewish law and practice are designed to underscore the centrality of '''[[ethics]]''' in the life of the Jews.

: Sixth, '''[[Israel]]''' is not only the Holy Land where our faith was born and developed, but it plays an essential role in our present and future. Israel is a symbol of the unity of the Jewish people the world over, the homeland for millions of Jews and a unique arena for Jewish creativity. Together with our responsibility to Israel is our obligation to strengthen and enrich the life of Jewish communities throughout the world — including, it need hardly be said, our own.

: Seventh, Jewish law and tradition, properly understood and interpreted, will enrich Jewish life and help mold the world closer to the prophetic vision of the '''[[Kingdom of God]]'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ve-Emunah-1990&quot;/&gt;

===God===
Conservative Judaism affirms [[monotheism]]. Its members have varied beliefs about the nature of [[God]], and no one understanding of God is mandated. Beliefs about God in the tradition of [[Jewish_philosophy#Jewish_rationalism|Jewish rationalism]] have been described as &quot;reemergent&quot; within the movement.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Jewish Rationalism Reemergent,&quot; ''Conservative Judaism,'' Volume 36, Issue 4‎, Page 81&lt;/ref&gt; Such rationalism often affirms [[Maimonides|Maimonidean]] views of God. Other views of God affirmed by members of the Conservative movement include [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic mysticism]]; [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[panentheism]] (neo-Hasidism, [[Jewish Renewal]]); limited theism (as in [[Harold Kushner]]'s ''[[When Bad Things Happen to Good People]]''); and organic thinking in the fashion of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]], also known as [[process theology]] (such as Rabbis Max Kaddushin, [[William E. Kaufman]], or [[Bradley Shavit Artson]]).

[[Mordecai Kaplan]]'s religious naturalism ([[Reconstructionist Judaism]]) used to have an influential place in the movement, but since Reconstructionism developed as an independent movement, this influence has waned. Papers from a recent [[Rabbinical Assembly]] conference on theology were printed in a special issue of the journal ''[[Conservative Judaism (journal)|Conservative Judaism]]'' (Winter 1999); the editors note that Kaplan's [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] seems to have dropped from the movement's radar screen.

====Revelation====
Conservative Jews hold a wide array of views on the subject of revelation. Many Conservative Jews reject the traditional Jewish idea that God literally dictated the words of the Torah to [[Moses]] at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in a verbal [[revelation]], but they hold the traditional Jewish belief that God inspired the later [[prophet]]s to write the rest of the [[Tanakh]]. Many Conservative Jews believe that Moses was inspired by God in the same manner as the later prophets.

Conservative Jews who reject the concept of verbal revelation believe that God revealed his will to Moses and other prophets in a non-verbal form — that is, God's revelation did not include the particular words of the divine texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080514084132/http://masortiworld.org/faq/theology-+beliefs/torah-misinai.html torah-misinai&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewlicious.com/2005/06/conservative-judaism/ Conservative Judaism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/conservatives.html Conservative Judaism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative Judaism is comfortable with [[higher criticism]], including the [[documentary hypothesis]], the theory that the Torah was redacted from several earlier sources. The movement's rabbinic authorities and its official Torah commentary ([[Etz Hayim Humash|''Etz Hayim: Torah and Commentary'']]) affirm that Jews should make use of modern critical literary and historical analysis to understand how the Bible developed.

Concerning the degree of revelation of Torah, Conservative Judaism rejects the Orthodox position of a direct verbal revelation of the Torah. However, Conservative Judaism also rejects the Reform view, that the Torah was not revealed but divinely inspired.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
In contrast to both, most Conservative positions affirm the divine but nonverbal revelation of written Torah as the authentic, historically correct Jewish view. In this view, [[Oral Torah]] is considered inspired by Torah, but not necessarily of a straightforward divine origin.

====Jewish law====
{{main|Conservative Halakha|Conservative responsa}}
Conservative Judaism views [[halakha]] (Jewish religious law) as normative and binding. Examining [[Jewish history]] and [[rabbinic literature]] through the lens of academic criticism, Conservative Judaism believes that halakha has always evolved to meet the changing realities of Jewish life, and that it must continue to do so in the modern age. Some Conservative theologians, like [[Seymour Siegel]] have stressed that the word, &quot;Conservative,&quot; must be understood in the way it is used in the British political system: that the laws and traditions have to be ''conserved'' or preserved, with changes allowed only when there is an overriding reason—almost always, an overriding ethical reason—to do so. Siegel believed such change could occur when halakhah and aggadah, the wealth of non-legalistic rabbinic literature that included lessons on Jewish morals, values, and ethics, came into conflict. When they did, he believed that ethics and aggadah should prevail.

This view, together with Conservative Judaism's diversity of opinion concerning divine revelation, accounts for some of the diversity and disagreement in the Conservative movement's halakha. When considering changes to halakha, Conservative Judaism's rabbinical authorities may rely on historical analysis as well as religious considerations. As Solomon Schechter noted, &quot;however great the literary value of a code may be, it does not invest it with infallibility, nor does it exempt it from the student or the Rabbi who makes use of it from the duty of examining each paragraph on its own merits, and subjecting it to the same rules of interpretation that were always applied to Tradition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Schechter, ''Studies in Judaism'', First Series, 1896, Jewish Publication Society of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning interpretation of [[Halakha]] (or Jewish law): because of Judaism's legal tradition, the fundamental differences between modern Jewish denominations also involve the relevance, interpretation, and application of [[Halakha|Jewish law and tradition]]. Conservative Judaism believes that its approach is the most authentic expression of Judaism as it was traditionally practiced. Conservative Jews believe that movements to its left, such as [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], have erred by rejecting the traditional authority of [[Halakha|Jewish law and tradition]]. They believe that the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] movements, on the theological right, have erred by slowing down, or stopping, the historical development of Jewish law:  &quot;Conservative Judaism believes that scholarly study of Jewish texts indicates that Judaism has constantly been evolving to meet the needs of the Jewish people in varying circumstances, and that a central halakhic authority can continue the halakhic evolution today.&quot; (Soc. Culture. Jewish Usenet Newsgroup FAQ) The Conservative movement makes a conscious effort to use historical sources to determine what kind of changes to Jewish tradition have occurred, how and why they occurred, and in what historical context. With this information they believe that they can better understand the proper way for rabbis to interpret and apply Jewish law to our conditions today. See also under [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Conservative Judaism|Modern Orthodox Judaism]].

[[Mordecai Waxman]], a leading figure in the Rabbinical Assembly, writes that &quot;Reform has asserted the right of interpretation but it rejected the authority of legal tradition. Orthodoxy has clung fast to the principle of authority, but has in our own and recent generations rejected the right to any but minor interpretations. The Conservative view is that both are necessary for a living Judaism. Accordingly, Conservative Judaism holds itself bound by the Jewish legal tradition, but asserts the right of its rabbinical body, acting as a whole, to interpret and to apply Jewish law.&quot; ([[Mordecai Waxman]] ''Tradition and Change: The Development of Conservative Judaism'')

Conservative Judaism views the process by which Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism make changes to Jewish tradition as potentially invalid {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Thus, Conservative Judaism rejects [[patrilineal]] descent and would hold that a child of a non-Jewish mother who was raised as a Reform or Reconstructionist Jew is not legally Jewish and would have to undergo [[religious conversion|conversion]] to become a Jew. The Conservative movement is committed to Jewish pluralism and respects the religious practices of Reform and Reconstructionist Jews. For example, the Conservative movement recognizes their [[clergy]] as rabbis, even if it does not necessarily accept their specific decisions. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Conservative Judaism accepts that the Orthodox approach to halakhah is generally valid. Accordingly, a Conservative Jew could usually satisfy their halakhic obligations by participation in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rituals. Occasionally, however, they may come into conflict. For instance, if two men and a woman were to eat a meal together, a Conservative Jew would believe that the presence of three adult Jews would obligate the group to say a communal form of the [[Birkat Hamazon#Zimmun|Grace After Meals]], while an Orthodox Jew would believe that, lacking three adult Jewish ''males'', the group would be ''forbidden'' to do such. Thus, though often ''de facto'' the case, Conservative Judaism's halakhic system does not ''inherently'' see Orthodox halakhic practice as acceptable and legitimate halakhic practice for a Conservative Jew.

====Jewish identity====
Conservative Judaism maintains the Rabbinic understanding of Jewish identity: A Jew is someone who was born to a Jewish mother, or who converts to Judaism in accordance with Jewish law and tradition. Conservatism thus rejects patrilineal descent, which is accepted by the Reform movement. Conservative Rabbis are not allowed to perform intermarriages (marriages between Jews and non-Jews). However, the Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism has a different sociological approach to this issue than does Orthodoxy, although agreeing religiously. In a press release it has stated:

:&quot;In the past, intermarriage...was viewed as an act of rebellion, a rejection of Judaism. Jews who intermarried were essentially [[excommunication|excommunicated]]. But now, intermarriage is often the result of living in an open society....If our children end up marrying non-Jews, we should not reject them. We should continue to give our love and by that retain a measure of influence in their lives, Jewishly and otherwise. Life consists of constant growth and our adult children may yet reach a stage when Judaism has new meaning for them. However, the marriage between a Jew and non-Jew is not a celebration for the Jewish community. We therefore reach out to the couple with the hope that the non-Jewish partner will move closer to Judaism and ultimately choose to convert. Since we know that over 70 percent of children of intermarried couples are not being raised as Jews...we want to encourage the Jewish partner to maintain his/her Jewish identity, and raise their children as Jews.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mishkantefila.com/Intermarriage.html|LEADERSHIP COUNCIL OF CONSERVATIVE JUDAISM, Statement on Intermarriage, Adopted March 7, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender equality===
In the 1970s and early 1980s, Conservative Judaism was divided over issues of [[gender equality]]. In 1973, the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] voted, without adopting an explanatory [[responsum]], to permit synagogues to count women toward a [[minyan]], but left the choice to individual congregations. After a further decade of debate, in 1983, JTS voted to admit women for ordination as Conservative rabbis, also without adopting an explanatory responsum. Some opponents of these decisions left the Conservative movement to form the [[Union for Traditional Judaism]].

In 2002, the Committee adopted a responsum that provides an official religious-law foundation for its past actions and articulates the current Conservative approach to the [[role of women in Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi David J. Fine, [http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf ''Women and the Minyan''], Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, June 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, a responsum was adopted by the Committee that approved the ordination of [[gay (term)|gay]] and [[lesbian]] rabbis and permitted [[Same-sex union|commitment ceremonies]] for lesbian and gay Jews (but not [[same-sex marriage]]), while maintaining the traditional prohibition against [[anal sex]] between men.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbis [[Elliot N. Dorff]], [[Daniel S. Nevins]], and Avram I. Reisner, [http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Dorff_Nevins_Reisner_Final.pdf ''Homosexuality, Human Dignity, &amp; Halakhah''], Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; An opposing responsum, that maintained the traditional prohibitions against ordinations and commitment ceremonies, was also approved. Both responsa were enacted as majority opinions, with some members of the Committee voting for both. This result gives individual synagogues, rabbis, and rabbinical schools discretion to adopt either approach.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/07/us/07jews.html Conservative Jews Allow Gay Rabbis and Unions]&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual rabbis continue to be free to avail themselves of more traditionalist minority rulings, and some congregations, particularly in Canada, accordingly still retain a more limited ritual role for women.

==Educational institutions==
===Advanced Jewish Learning===
[[File:American Jewish University, Bel Air, California.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies]] at [[American Jewish University]]]]
[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|thumb|right|200px| Jewish Theological Seminary]]
The Conservative movement maintains a number of Rabbinical seminaries:

*The [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]], the flagship institution of the movement
*The [[Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies]], at the non-denominational [[American Jewish University]] in [[Los Angeles]];
*The [[Marshall T. Meyer Latin American Rabbinical Seminary]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Seminario Rabínico Latinoamericano Marshall T. Meyer''), in [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]; and
*The [[Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]:מכון שכטר) in [[Jerusalem]].

A Conservative movement-affiliated institution which does not grant rabbinic ordination but which runs along the lines of a traditional [[yeshiva]] is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]], located in [[Jerusalem]].

Conservative rabbis also play a leading role at a number of non-denominational institutions of advanced Jewish learning. The rosh yeshivas at [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in [[New York, New York]] include Conservative rabbis Eli Kaunfer and Shai Held. The Rosh Yeshiva at the [[Canadian Yeshiva &amp; Rabbinical School]] in Toronto is a Conservative rabbi, Roy Tanenbaum. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculties of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis. Many smaller programs, such as Rabbi Benay Lappe's SVARA yeshiva, are also led by Conservative rabbis.

===Day Schools===
The [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]] maintains the [[Solomon Schechter Day School Association|Solomon Schecter Day Schools]], comprising 76 [[day school]]s in 19 American states and two Canadian provinces serving Jewish children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssdsa.org/?page=about Solomon Schecter Day School Association: About]&lt;/ref&gt; Many other &quot;community day schools&quot; that are not affiliated with the Solomon Schechter network take a generally Conservative approach, but the Schechter schools, these schools generally have &quot;no barriers to enrollment based on the faith of the parents or on religious practices in the home.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;forward.com&quot;&gt;Jennifer Siegel, [http://www.forward.com/articles/13533 Will Conservative Day Schools Survive?], June 05, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  During the first decade of the 21st century, a number of schools that were part of the Schechter network transformed themselves into non-affiliated community day schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;forward.com&quot;/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{main|Criticism of Conservative Judaism}}
Conservative Judaism has come under criticism from a variety of sources such as:
* [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] who question the movement's commitment to [[Halakha]].
* Conservative Traditionalists who criticize the [[CLJS|Halakhic process]] when dealing with issues such as women in Judaism as well as homosexuality.

Orthodox Jewish leaders vary considerably in their dealings with the Conservative movement and with individual Conservative Jews. Some [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] leaders cooperate and work with the Conservative movement, while [[Haredi Judaism|haredi]] (&quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot;) Jews often eschew formal contact with Conservative Judaism, or at least its rabbinate.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Responsa of Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]]&lt;!--Can we get something a little more specific?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From the Orthodox perspective, Conservative Jews are considered just as Jewish as Orthodox Jews, but they are viewed as misguided, consistent violators of halakha.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avi Shafran]], [http://web.archive.org/web/20060106063953/http://www.momentmag.com/archive/feb01/feat2.html &quot;The Conservative Lie&quot;], ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]'', February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Conservative Judaism has experienced internal criticism. Due to halakhic disputes, such as the controversies over the [[Role of women in Judaism|role of women]] and [[Judaism and homosexuality|homosexuality]], some Conservative [[Talmud]]ic scholars and experts in halakha have left the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] and the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Weiss]], {{PDFlink|[http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_download/gid,143 &quot;Open Orthodoxy! A Modern Orthodox Rabbi's Creed&quot;]|766&amp;nbsp;KB}}, ''Judaism'', Fall 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/07/us/07jews.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Conservative Jews Allow Gay Rabbis and Unions – New York Times&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the seminary's former Chancellor, Rabbi [[Ismar Schorsch]], complained of the movement's &quot;erosion of [its] fidelity to Halacha ... [which] brings [it] close to Reform Judaism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Forward&quot;&gt;Jennifer Siegel, [http://web.archive.org/web/20070929122036/http://www.forward.com/articles/conservative-rabbi-in-swan-song-warns-against-li/ &quot;Conservative Rabbi, in Swan Song, Warns Against Liberal Shift&quot;], ''[[The Forward|The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', March 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In matters of [[Jewish views of marriage|marriage]] and [[Get (divorce document)|divorce]], the [[State of Israel]] relies on its [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbinate]] to determine [[Who is a Jew?|who is Jewish]]; the Chief Rabbinate, following Orthodox practice, does not recognize the validity of [[Conversion to Judaism|conversions]] performed by Conservative rabbis and will require a Jew who was converted by a Conservative rabbi to undergo a second, Orthodox conversion to be regarded as a Jew for marriage and other purposes.

The '''Common Desktop Environment''' ('''CDE''') is a [[desktop environment]] for [[Unix]] and [[OpenVMS]], based on the [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif widget toolkit]].

== History ==
=== Corporate history ===

[[SunSoft, Inc.|SunSoft]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]] and [[Unix System Laboratories|USL]] announced CDE in June 1993 as a joint development within the [[Common Open Software Environment]] (COSE) initiative.  The primary environment was based on HP's [[VUE]] (Visual User Environment), itself derived from the [[Motif Window Manager]] (mwm).  IBM contributed its [[Common User Access]] model and [[Workplace Shell]].  [[Novell]] provided desktop manager components and scalable systems technologies from [[UNIX System V]].  Sun contributed its [[ToolTalk]] application interaction framework and a port of its [[DeskSet]] productivity tools, including mail and  calendar clients, from its [[OpenWindows]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1994 CDE became the responsibility of the &quot;new OSF&quot;, a merger of the [[Open Software Foundation]] and [[Unix International]];&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
in September 1995, the merger of Motif and CDE into a single project, CDE/Motif, was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Until about 2000, users of Unix desktops regarded CDE as the ''[[de facto]]'' standard, but at that time, other desktop environments such as [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] were quickly becoming mature, and became almost universal on the [[Linux]] platform, which already had a larger user base than most commercial Unixes in total.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  [[Red Hat]] is the only Linux distribution to which CDE has been ported, although it has since been phased out in favour of GNOME. However CDE code can still be bought and compiled on any UNIX or UNIX-like OS.

In 2001, Sun Microsystems announced that they would phase out CDE as the standard [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] desktop environment in favor of GNOME. Solaris 10, released in early 2005, includes both CDE and the GNOME-based [[Java Desktop System]].  Future releases of Solaris will be based on the [[OpenSolaris]] open source project, which states that there is no plan to make the Solaris CDE &quot;consolidation&quot; (OS component) available as open source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |title = OpenSolaris Consolidation Information
  |accessdate = 2007-12-01
  |work = OpenSolaris Web site
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hewlett-Packard|HP's]] [[OpenVMS]] uses CDE as its standard desktop environment.

The Open Group released Motif in 2000 as [[OpenMotif]] under a &quot;revenue sharing&quot; license that does not fully meet either the [[Open Source Definition|open source]] or [[Free software licence|free software]] definitions. (The Open Group had wished to make it open source, but did not quite succeed in achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;

  |accessdate = 2007-11-30
  |date = 2004-07-13
  |publisher = The Open Group
}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In 2006, a petition was created asking The Open Group to release the source code for CDE and Motif under a free license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Xfce]] desktop at one time took part of its [[look and feel]] from the CDE environment, but no longer does.

OpenCDE, an open source project to replicate CDE, was started in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Children of Dune''''' is a 1976 [[science fiction]] novel by [[Frank Herbert]], third in a series of six novels set in his [[Dune universe|''Dune'' universe]]. Initially selling over 75,000 copies, it became the first hardcover best-seller ever in the science fiction field.&lt;ref name=&quot;Touponce 119&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Touponce |first=William  F. |year=1988 |title=Frank Herbert|chapter=Herbert's Reputation|location=[[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]|publisher=Twayne  Publishers imprint, G.

Herbert's vision of a people forced by circumstance into total ecological awareness is worked out in convincing details ... What sets these books apart from their competitors is the obsessive quality of Herbert's imagination ... To read the ''Dune'' trilogy is to plunge into someone else's obsession ... Virtually every page in the trilogy contains a sentence that hints at the momentousness of the events being described. This is where the religiosity comes in. Herbert keeps interrupting the action with quotes from made-up sources that reinforce the atmosphere of millennial conflict and resolution. Taken out of context, these passages sound silly, like the words of wisdom spoken by Oriental sages on a TV sound stage ... But the whole point of an obsession is that it cannot be criticized from the outside; what distinguishes a successful obsessional tale from a failure that the reader is held, like Coleridge's Wedding Guest, so that 'he cannot choose but hear', no matter what his other faculties tell him. On this criterion, I would personally rate the ''Dune'' trilogy an unqualified success.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugo77&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1977-hugo-awards/|title=1977 Hugo Awards|publisher=World Science Fiction Society|accessdate=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally [[Serial (literature)|serial]]ized in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'' in 1976, and was the last ''Dune'' novel to be serialized before book publication. The novels ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' and ''Children of Dune'' were adapted into a well-received television [[miniseries]] entitled ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune]]'' by the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in 2003. In 2002, the [[Science Fiction Book Club]] also published the two novels in one volume.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Frank. ''Dune Messiah and Children of Dune''. 1st SFBC Printing edition (2002), 592 pages. ISBN 0-739-42399-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of ''Dune Messiah'', [[Paul Atreides]] walks into the desert, a blind man, leaving his twin children [[Leto Atreides II|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] in the care of the [[Fremen]], while his sister [[Alia Atreides|Alia]] rules the universe as regent. Awoken in the womb by the [[Melange (fictional drug)|spice]], the children are the heirs to Paul's [[prescience|prescient]] vision of the fate of the universe, a role that Alia desperately craves. [[House Corrino]] schemes to return to the throne, while the [[Bene Gesserit]] make common cause with the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] and [[Spacing Guild]] to gain control of the spice and the children of Paul Atreides.

==Context==
''Dune'' traces the rise of Paul Muad’Dib, a young nobleman in an interstellar feudal empire who takes control of the single critical resource in the universe &amp;mdash; the lifespan-enhancing, consciousness-expanding drug spice melange. As the first book closes, Paul has triumphed. His scheming, evil enemies are dead or overthrown, and he is set to take the reins of power and bring a hard but enlightened peace to the universe.

Herbert chose in the books that followed to undermine Paul’s triumph with a string of failures and philosophical paradoxes; ''Dune'' was a heroic melody, and ''Dune Messiah'' was its [[Inversion (music)|inversion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herbert|first=Frank|url=http://www.dunenovels.com/news/genesis.html |title=''Dune'' Genesis|accessdate=June 16, 2008 |publisher=DuneNovels.com ([[Internet Archive]])|work=[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]|date=July 1980|quote=Of course there are other themes and fugal interplays in ''Dune'' and throughout the trilogy. ''Dune Messiah'' performs a classic inversion of the theme. ''Children of Dune'' expands the number of themes interplaying. I refuse, however, to provide further answers to this complex mixture. That fits the pattern of the fugue. You find your own solutions. Don't look to me as your leader. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080616111957/http://www.dunenovels.com/news/genesis.html |archivedate = June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the second novel, ''Dune Messiah'', opens, Muad’Dib’s religion has sent his fanatical soldiers on an interstellar jihad, leaving billions dead. His vision of peace is being corrupted by dogmatic religious bureaucrats, and his once-noble desert tribes, the Fremen, are fat and wealthy on the spoils of war and the de-desertification of Dune.

==Synopsis==
===The crucible===
As ''Children of Dune'' begins, it is nine years since the Emperor Paul Muad'dib walked into the desert, blind. The ecological transformation of [[Arrakis|Dune]] continues apace and some of the Fremen are even living without [[stillsuit]]s in the less arid climate. Fremen have started to move out of the Sietches and into the villages and cities. Millions of Fremen, thanks to the Jihad, have experience of life off planet or out of the desert, opening their minds to new possibilities yet also causing them to forget the old ways. It is a time of great social change and economic growth on the new capital planet of the Imperium, as more and more pilgrims arrive each day to experience the planet of Muad'dib and Alia.

The members of the Imperial high council &amp;mdash; Alia, [[Duncan Idaho]], [[Irulan Corrino|Princess Irulan]] (who, since the death of Paul, has taken the role of caregiver to the Atreides children) and [[Stilgar]] &amp;mdash; meet and lament the fact that they have lost the initiative in the political arena. Paul Atreides had been powerless to control the Jihad and had left only the shadow of his religious mantle. Now Alia and her council are even less capable of controlling it. They are finding themselves tightening their grip on politics and ritual, yet losing more control. The two young children of Paul, Leto II and Ghanima, are not normal nine year old children. Like Alia, they were forced into consciousness before birth and thus possess [[Other Memory]], access to the lives and memories of all their ancestors. The children are very troubled because they have come to the conclusion that Alia has succumbed to what the Bene Gesserit call &quot;[[abomination (Dune)|abomination]]&quot; &amp;mdash; possession by one of her ancestors &amp;mdash; and fear that a similar fate awaits them. They (and Alia) also realize that the quickening [[terraforming]] of Dune will kill all the [[sandtrout]] and thus bring to an end the [[Sandworm (Dune)|Giant Worms]], and inevitably to the spice itself.

Leto has an additional fear as well: he has started to have dreams which he is coming to believe are prophetic, like his father had when he was a similar age. He fears being locked into an early prescient vision as he suspects happened to his father before him. He also has the added pressure that Alia is pushing him to enter into an overdose-induced [[spice trance]] in order to unlock the door to prophetic visions. She feels the need for such visions in order to rule the empire, yet struggles to achieve them at all for herself.

Things have reached a heightened note of tension because [[Lady Jessica]] is coming to Arrakis to visit her grandchildren from her self-imposed retreat on [[Caladan]]. Alia fears this because she has indeed become possessed by the persona of her grandfather, the evil [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]], and is sure that her mother will notice despite Alia's erroneous belief that no one has yet recognised the change in her. The Baron is leading her far away from the Atreides way of doing things: she has taken a lover behind Duncan's back, a priest called Javid.

Out in the desert, a new religious figure has arisen among the Fremen, who preaches against the injustices of the religious government and the changes among the Fremen. He is called 'The Preacher', and some even believe he is actually Paul Atreides.

Meanwhile, on [[Salusa Secundus]], fallen House Corrino is plotting again for power. [[Wensicia Corrino|Princess Wensicia]], younger sister of Irulan, rules in the name of her son [[Farad'n Corrino|Farad'n]]. She has plans for her son to become [[Padishah Emperor|Emperor]] and has hatched a plot to assassinate the twins.

===Enter Jessica===
Jessica arrives on Arrakis already wary. She has been approached by the Bene Gesserit, and forced to recognize that she has been ignoring important duties. She makes her peace with the Sisterhood, and is apparently welcomed back into the fold. With their warnings, Jessica returns fearing that Alia and her grandchildren have fallen into abomination. At the landing field she meets Alia, and immediately realizes that, for Alia at least, this is true. Alia is actually relieved by this &amp;mdash; the time of concealment is over.

A situation develops where everyone but Stilgar and Duncan Idaho have plans for the twins, but what no one realizes is that the twins have plans of their own.

Jessica arranges a meeting with Ghanima. She sees no signs of abomination on either of the twins, but Leto shows signs of concealing something, so she excludes him from the meeting. Jessica and Ghanima meet truly as grandmother and granddaughter, and do not hide the love between them, straight away finding a common cause. Jessica learns the twins are aware that Alia has fallen into abomination, and of their speculation that undergoing the spice trance was Alia's fatal mistake. She quickly confirms that Ghanima is not possessed but still worries about Leto. Ghanima calms Jessica's fears on that score, but admits she worries for her brother.

Jessica next talks to Leto. Their meeting is far more confrontational, and Leto controls the path of the conversation. First he reveals to her his understanding of how she had been manipulated by the Bene Gesserit into coming to Arrakis through the conditioning of her training; then Leto orders Jessica to let herself be kidnapped.

Leto talks to Stilgar. First, Leto shakes Stilgar's presumptions about him, by pointing out his memories and experiences go back far further than Stilgar, and that he is most suited to be Emperor. He lets Stilgar know that he is starting to have dreams of prophecy. He tells Stilgar that in one future, he is killed at the spot they are talking. He orders Stilgar to flee with Ghanima into the desert if that happens. He also undermines Stilgar's support for Alia, pointing out the flaws in her thinking, the destructive place it will take the Empire and the Fremen, and the fact she is no longer his friend. He makes Stilgar realize that change is coming and that traditional thinking was not the absolute guide Stilgar had thought it was.

===Attack on the Atreides===
At Jessica's first reception with Alia, an assassination attempt is made on Jessica's life by minions of Alia/The Baron. Only with the help of old fedaykin companions of Paul is Jessica able to escape into the desert. A rebellion breaks out among the Fremen inspired by this latest injustice, a rebellion made all the more dangerous and legitimate because the mother of Muad'dib supports it and so counterweighs Alia's own religious mantle. Jessica presses for Alia to be tested for possession.

At this time the twins choose to go out into the desert during the night. They do this even though they are aware that an attack will be made on their lives, prewarned by a vision of Leto's. The twins are attacked by two Laza tigers sent by Wensicia, but they manage to kill the tigers, despite an injury to Ghanima. They then institute their own plan; Ghanima uses a hypnotic technique to convince herself that her brother was killed by the tigers, and goes back to Sietch Tabr grief stricken. As a beneficial side effect of this hypnotic technique she finds that it gives immunity from the voices within.

Meanwhile Farad'n has been told about the assassination attempt on Leto and Ghanima. He is shocked, not so much at the attempt, but at the clumsiness of it. But now he realizes the stakes involved.

Duncan meanwhile is aware that Alia is cuckolding him with Javid, which he naturally enough finds heartbreaking, but he is utterly distraught with the realization that Alia is suffering from possession. He comes to realize that Alia is possessed when she suggests to him to get rid of Jessica. He realizes that on top of the fact that it is not the sort of behaviour an Atreides indulges in, that if she was in contact with her mother within her mind she would not even consider this, so obviously she is prevented from this. He concludes that she is possessed. Alia implies to Duncan she would like her mother to disappear. Duncan offers to make it happen, and Alia 'reluctantly' agrees.

Duncan does make Jessica disappear but not as Alia expects. Duncan 'kidnaps' Jessica and takes her to Salusa Secundus, where she is to meet an interesting pupil. Jessica, unsure of Duncan's motives, asks who he serves. He says the Preacher. She asks if it is her son. He answers 'I wish I knew.'

Duncan and Jessica arrive on Salusa. Farad'n informs Jessica with some compassion that her grandson has been killed, though her granddaughter survived. The Bene Gesserit have formally protested to the [[Landsraad]] concerning the Corrino assassination attempt. Farad'n uses the situation to force his formal confirmation of power from his mother in front of witnesses. Jessica and Farad'n make a bargain. Jessica will announce that she has come to Salusa of her own free will. Farad'n will send his mother off into exile. Jessica will train Farad'n in the ways of the Bene Gesserit. The Bene Gesserit promise Farad'n the throne with Ghanima as his mate. Duncan attempts to commit suicide when he hears that Alia has offered herself as wife to Farad'n, an offer Farad'n was not foolish enough to accept.

Alia dresses as a commoner and goes to witness a speech by the Preacher in order to determine whether or not he is in fact Paul, her brother. Partway through the speech, the Preacher directs himself at Alia, seeing through her disguise, and eventually whispers in her ear and addresses her as &quot;sister.&quot; Alia is momentarily paralyzed by the revelation while the crowd disperses.

Duncan and Jessica talk. Duncan Idaho formally withdraws from Atreides service. He insults Jessica and advises Farad'n that he should send Jessica back to the Bene Gesserit.

===Leto's journey===
Leto goes off seeking his father. He knows that in past centuries there was once a renegade tribe of Fremen called the Iduali or &quot;Water Insects&quot; who lived at a place called Sietch Jacurutu. He discovered there was a hidden village, or sietch, close to the site of old Jacurutu called Shuloch, which was inhabited by the same Iduali tribe. The Iduali, centuries before, killed other Fremen to take their water (This is the most heinous crime known to the Fremen). In retaliation, the Fremen banded their sietches together and massacred the Iduali and declared their sietch taboo. However the surviving Iduali still secretly lived there. Jacurutu-renamed-Fondak/Shuloch was in most people's minds just a legend, and it thus an ideal hiding place. Leto thinks, rightly, that when his father was blinded by a [[stone burner]] and went off into the desert to die, that if anyone took him in it had to have been men of Jacurutu. Leto went to Jacurutu to seek asylum as well as his father.

Leto finds Jacurutu, but as he tries to infiltrate the camp he is captured. When he wakes up, he discovers that he has been captured by [[Gurney Halleck]] and a certain Namri. They tell him he has come to school. He is forcibly injected with spice essence, and so undergoes the spice trance. Gurney thinks it is on Jessica's instructions but due to Namri's secret alliances it is really Alia's.

Leto goes through the transformatory experience. Leto experiences fascinating and overwhelming oracular visions of possible futures. He nearly loses his mind, but in the end he manages to get through it. In all these futures but one, humanity goes extinct. This future is the one he has deemed &quot;Secher Nbiw&quot;, (in the Arabic-based Fremen tongue) the [[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]].

In his vision of the Golden Path, he sees the way out of his dilemma. He does this by seeking allies within the ancestors for the future, principally an old ruler from the distant past named Harum. These allies within join with him in order to make the Golden Path happen. After his experience he is tested by Namri, and survives the first test. Before they can test him again, he escapes into the desert. When they discover Leto gone, Namri and Gurney argue. Namri brags to Gurney that he has been serving Alia, not Jessica as he thought, and attacks him. This was a serious mistake: Gurney kills him and easily escapes from Jacurutu.

Alia and Duncan meet up again. Alia is shocked to learn her mother is not dead and is indeed training Farad'n. She is not aware that this was deliberate 'treachery' on Duncan's part, instead she thinks it is his innocence, that led him to take her literally. However, Alia/The Baron decides to arrange an accident for Duncan, seeing him as too dangerous. Duncan, as a mentat, sees through her clumsy plot, pretends to agree with her plans, and then escapes in a thopter.

===Leto's transformation===
Leto's escape is not a complete one. He discovers that Namri had cut the heel pumps in his stillsuit and he has lost half his water. So he goes to Shuloch on his own terms. He meets a party of the men of Jucurutu/Shuloch, and through subterfuge gets Muriz, the leader, to offer him hospitality rights.

Leto discovers that these Jacurutu Fremen are trapping Giant Worms for sale and transfer off world. This presents him with the opportunity to make his vision real. Leto sacrifices his humanity and, for the sake of the survival of the human race, chooses to accept the body of a sandworm. He delves into a pool of sandtrout, which form a living skin around him. He then explores the desert with his new, near-invulnerable body with which he runs through the desert at tremendous speed and possesses the strength of many men. Leto is no longer fully human, and his powers have become superhuman.

Leto travels through the desert until he comes across the Preacher. He puts himself across the path of the worm which the Preacher and his guide are traveling on. Despite the guide's urging, the giant worm refuses to ride over Leto, recognising the sandtrout on Leto's body. Leto greets his father. It is a terrible moment for Paul Atreides, facing a son who had the bravery to do what he would not.

Stilgar has been maintaining his neutrality between Alia and the rebels. But Duncan Idaho deliberately provokes Stilgar into a rage by killing Javid, and then insulting Stilgar. The maddened Stilgar kills him. Stilgar immediately recognizes Idaho's plan. By killing him, Stilgar has no choice but to become a rebel to escape the vengeance which Alia would be forced to display for the public murder of her husband. By his actions, Idaho forced Stilgar to flee, taking Ghanima away from Alia's reach.

Alia hears of Duncan's death. She does the expected Fremen thing and orders her forces to find Stilgar and kill him. After doing this, and much to the internal Baron's surprise she grieves for Duncan, and for a moment returns to being just Alia.

While conflict continues between the rebels and the loyalists and as Stilgar flees from hiding place to hiding place, Leto spends his time moving through the desert wrecking the ecological transformation of Arrakis by destroying the reservoirs ([[List of Dune terminology#Q|qanats]]) that were being used to feed it. He is seen as a desert demon. Leto shows up yet again at Jacurutu and kills any Jacurutu men who opposed him, and the rest surrendered. Jacurutu accepts his orders with religious awe: he wears the skin of Shai-Hulud. Among his orders, Leto tells Jacurutu to plant an oasis garden, as he planned to settle down and live there.

===Leto's return===
After long conflict, Alia manages to recapture Ghanima through treachery. She offers Ghanima as bride to Farad'n. Ghanima agrees to this wedding, but only so she can get close enough to Farad'n to kill him, whom she believes had her brother assassinated. Alia plans to pick up the pieces from the chaos that would result. Farad'n arrives on Dune for the ceremony.

Leto makes his move. He goes to [[Arrakeen]] as The Preacher's guide. Paul as the Preacher makes a virulent speech against Alia, which provokes a priest to kill him in front of the eyes of Alia, Farad'n and Jessica. To everyone's shock Leto arrives in a display of superhuman strength, Ghanima in hand. He says the keywords to awaken Ghanima's secret memories. She asks him if the plan worked, and he says &quot;well enough.&quot; Alia orders the guards to seize him, but he throws them aside, and the rest of the guards are too scared to enter the room. Leto advances on Alia, and the twins offer her their help conquering her inner lives, as they have. But Alia fragments totally, with different voices in different languages pouring out of her. Leto realizes that the Baron's hold over her is too strong, and provides two options: to the Baron, a Trial of Possession, an ancient ritual that would guarantee the Baron's undoing; and to Alia, the open window, high above the temple steps. As a helpless Jessica looks on, Alia regains control of her body long enough to leap out the window to her death.

Leto makes himself Emperor. He uses his new near-invulnerable body to establish himself as undisputed Emperor, scaring all the Fremen naibs into submission. He ingests poisons, lifts heavy weights, and survives wounds from blades in order to prove this power. In the end all the naibs come to Arakeen to surrender leadership to him.

Leto reveals the Golden Path to Farad'n, whom Leto renames &quot;Harq al-Ada&quot; (&quot;Breaker of Habit&quot;). Farad'n accepts a post as Royal Scribe, and gives Leto his legions of [[Sardaukar]] in their agreement that Farad'n will be the father of Ghanima's children, and that Leto will thus take over the Bene Gesserit breeding program. The seemingly immortal and omnipotent Leto is left as Emperor of the Known Universe, with Ghanima at his side.

'''''Candide, ou l'Optimisme''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|k|æ|n|ˈ|d|iː|d}}; French: {{IPA-fr|kɑ̃did|}}) is a French [[satire]] first published in 1759 by [[Voltaire]], a [[philosopher]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The [[novella]] has been widely translated, with English versions titled '''''Candide: or, All for the Best''''' (1759); '''''Candide: or, The Optimist''''' (1762); and '''''Candide: or, Optimism''''' (1947).&lt;ref&gt;Critical Survey of Short Fiction (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with a young man, Candide, who is living a sheltered life in an [[Garden of Eden|Edenic]] [[paradise]] and being indoctrinated with [[Gottfried Leibniz#Theodicy and optimism|Leibnizian optimism]] (or simply ''Optimism'') by his mentor, Pangloss. The work describes the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle, followed by Candide's slow, painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world. Voltaire concludes with Candide, if not outright rejecting optimism, advocating an enigmatic precept, &quot;we must cultivate our garden&quot;, in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss, &quot;all is for the best in the [[best of all possible worlds]]&quot;.

''Candide'' is characterised by its sarcastic tone, as well as by its erratic, fantastical and fast-moving plot. A [[picaresque novel]] with a story similar to that of a more serious ''[[bildungsroman]]'', it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]].&lt;ref name=mason10&gt;Mason (1992), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the [[problem of evil]], so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through [[allegory]]; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.&lt;ref name = davidson54/&gt;&lt;ref name=aldridge260&gt;Aldridge (1975), p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--aldridge sources &quot;insight into the human condition&quot; --&gt;

As expected by Voltaire, ''Candide'' has enjoyed both great success and great scandal. Immediately after its secretive publication, the book was widely banned because it contained religious blasphemy, political sedition and intellectual hostility hidden under a thin veil of naïveté.&lt;ref name = davidson54/&gt; However, with its sharp wit and insightful portrayal of the human condition, the novel has since inspired many later authors and artists to mimic and adapt it; most notably, [[Leonard Bernstein]] composed the music for the [[Candide (operetta)|1956 comic operetta]] adapted from the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Leister (1985), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The original 1956 [[libretto]] of ''Candide'', written by [[Lillian Hellman]], was an intensely bitter and somewhat loose adaptation of Voltaire, but [[Hugh Wheeler]]'s new libretto, first produced in 1974, was a far more faithful adaptation of the novella, and the one which is still in use today. Today, ''Candide'' is recognised as Voltaire's ''[[magnum opus]]''&lt;ref name = davidson54/&gt; and is often listed as part of the [[Western canon]]; it is likely taught more than any other work of [[French literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldinger (1987), p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical and literary background ==
A number of deadly historical events inspired Voltaire to write ''Candide'', most notably the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]: both are frequently referred to in the book and are cited by scholars as reasons for its composition.&lt;ref name=wade1959b88&gt;Wade (1959b), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, [[tsunami]], and resulting fires of [[All Saints' Day]], had a strong influence on theologians of the day and on Voltaire, who was himself disillusioned by them. The earthquake had an especially large effect on the contemporary doctrine of optimism, a philosophical system which implies that such events should not occur. Optimism is founded on the [[theodicy]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] that says all is for the best because God is a benevolent deity. This concept is often put into the form, &quot;all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds&quot; (Fr. &quot;''Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes''&quot;). Philosophers had trouble fitting the horrors of this earthquake into the optimist [[world view]].&lt;ref name=radner669&gt;Radner &amp; Radner (1998), pp. 669–686&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1755 Lisbon earthquake.jpg|thumb|left|350px|This 1755 copper engraving shows the ruins of [[Lisbon]] in flames and a [[tsunami]] overwhelming the ships in the harbour.]]
Voltaire actively rejected Leibnizian optimism after the natural disaster, convinced that if this were the best possible world, it should surely be better than it is.&lt;ref name=mason4&gt;Mason (1992), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In both ''Candide'' and ''[[Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne]]'' (&quot;Poem on the Lisbon Disaster&quot;), Voltaire attacks this optimist belief.&lt;ref name=radner669/&gt; He makes use of the Lisbon earthquake in both ''Candide'' and his ''Poème'' to argue this point, sarcastically describing the catastrophe as one of the most horrible disasters &quot;in the best of all possible worlds&quot;.&lt;ref name=wade1959b93&gt;Wade (1959b), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the earthquake, unreliable rumours circulated around Europe, sometimes overestimating the severity of the event. Ira Wade, a noted expert on Voltaire and ''Candide'', has analysed which sources Voltaire might have referenced in learning of the event. Wade speculates that Voltaire's primary source for information on the Lisbon earthquake was the 1755 work ''[[Relation historique du Tremblement de Terre survenu à Lisbonne]]'' by [[Ange Goudar]].&lt;ref name=wade1959b93&gt;Wade (1959b), pp. 88, 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from such events, contemporaneous stereotypes of the German personality may have been a source of inspiration for the text, as they were for ''[[Simplicius Simplicissimus]]'', a 1669 satirical picaresque novel written by [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen]] and inspired by the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The protagonist of this novel, who was supposed to embody stereotypically German characteristics, is quite similar to the protagonist of ''Candide.''&lt;ref name = aldridge251254/&gt; These stereotypes, according to Voltaire biographer [[Alfred Owen Aldridge]], include &quot;extreme credulousness or sentimental simplicity&quot;, two of Candide's, and Simplicius's, defining qualities. Aldridge writes, &quot;Since Voltaire admitted familiarity with fifteenth-century German authors who used a bold and buffoonish style, it is quite possible that he knew ''Simplicissimus'' as well.&quot;&lt;ref name = aldridge251254/&gt;

A satirical and parodic precursor of ''Candide'', [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726) is one of ''Candide''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s closest literary relatives. This satire tells the story of &quot;a gullible ingenue&quot;, Gulliver, who (like Candide) travels to several &quot;remote nations&quot; and is hardened by the many misfortunes which befall him. As evidenced by similarities between the two books, Voltaire likely drew upon ''Gulliver's Travels'' for inspiration while writing ''Candide''.&lt;ref&gt;Havens (1973), pp. 844–845&lt;/ref&gt; Other probable sources of inspiration for ''Candide'' are ''[[The Adventures of Telemachus|Télémaque]]'' (1699) by [[François Fénelon]] and ''Cosmopolite'' (1753) by [[Louis-Charles Fougeret de Monbron]]. ''Candide''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s parody of the ''bildungsroman'' is likely based on ''Télémaque'', which includes the prototypical parody of the sagacious tutor on whom Pangloss may have been partly based. Likewise, Monbron's protagonist undergoes a disillusioning series of travels similar to those of Candide.&lt;ref name = aldridge251254/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade (1959b), p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broome (1960), p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--SOURCE for more info on the connection to Monbron, see:

* The 1757 execution of British [[admiral]] [[John Byng]] is alluded to in ''Candide''. According to Martin, the character representing Byng is executed only &quot;pour encourager les autres&quot; (to encourage the others). This explanation has since become proverbial.&lt;ref name = davidson54/&gt;
* When Voltaire wrote in ''Candide'' that the [[Academy of Bordeaux]] offered a prize to the person who could best explain the existence of Candide's red sheep, he was alluding to an actual offer that was made by that Academy in 1741 to anyone who could write an explanation for [[black people]] having a dark [[skin colour]].&lt;ref name=aldridge255&gt; Aldridge (1975), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; NOTE: Dbaba uncommented this, I think, because he thought there was a dispute over factual accuracy; rather, the material is simply out of place and unnecessary. -- Rmrfstar - 31/5/08 --&gt;

== Creation ==
&lt;!--
=== Writing ===--&gt;
Born François-Marie Arouet, Voltaire (1694–1778), by the time of the Lisbon earthquake, was already a well-established author, known for his satirical wit. He had been made a member of the [[Académie Française]] in 1746. He was a [[deist]], a strong proponent of religious freedom, and a critic of what he saw to be [[tyranny|tyrannical]] governments. ''Candide'' became part of his large, diverse body of philosophical, political and artistic works expressing these views.&lt;ref name=means&gt;Means (2006), pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;Gopnik (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it was a model for the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century novels called the &quot;''[[Philosophical novel|contes philosophiques]]''&quot;. This genre, of which Voltaire was one of the founders, included previous works of his such as ''[[Zadig]]'' and ''[[Micromegas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McGhee (1943), pp. 438, 440&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge (1975), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1970), pp. 19–35&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- check different capitalisations in title in different manuscripts --&gt;
It is unknown exactly when Voltaire wrote ''Candide'',&lt;ref&gt;Wade (1959a), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; but scholars estimate that it was primarily composed in late 1758 and begun as early as 1757:&lt;ref&gt;Torrey (1929), p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire is believed to have written a portion of it while at his house in [[Ferney]] and also while visiting [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Théodore]], the [[Electoral Palatinate|Elector-Palatinate]] at [[Schwetzingen]], for three weeks in the summer of 1758. Despite solid evidence for these claims, a popular legend persists that Voltaire wrote ''Candide'' in three days. This idea is probably based on a misreading of the 1885 work ''La Vie intime de Voltaire aux Délices et à Ferney'' by [[Lucien Perey]] (real name: Clara Adèle Luce Herpin) and [[Gaston Maugras]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wade1956&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Havens (1932), p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence indicates strongly that Voltaire did not rush nor improvise ''Candide'', but worked on it for a significant period of time, even a whole year. ''Candide'' is mature and carefully developed, not impromptu, as the intentionally choppy plot and the aforementioned myth suggest.&lt;ref&gt;Wade (1959b), pp. 145, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--==== Manuscripts ====--&gt;
There is only one extant manuscript of ''Candide'' that was written before the work's 1759 publication; it was discovered in 1956 by Wade and since named the ''La Vallière Manuscript''. It is believed to have been sent, chapter by chapter, by Voltaire to the Duke and Duchess La Vallière in the autumn of 1758.&lt;ref name = williams123/&gt; The manuscript was sold to the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in the late eighteenth century, where it remained undiscovered for almost two hundred years.&lt;ref name=rouillard&gt;Rouillard (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''La Vallière Manuscript'', the most original and authentic of all surviving copies of ''Candide'', was likely dictated by Voltaire to his secretary, [[Wagnière]], then edited directly.&lt;ref name = wade1956/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade (1957), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this manuscript, there is believed to have been another, one copied by Wagnière for the Elector Charles-Théodore, who hosted Voltaire during the summer of 1758. The existence of this copy was first postulated by Norman L. Torrey in 1929. If it exists, it remains undiscovered.&lt;ref name=wade1956&gt;Wade (1956), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrey (1929), pp. 445–447&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--=== 1759 publication ===--&gt;
Voltaire published ''Candide'' simultaneously in five countries no later than 15 January 1759, although the exact date is uncertain.&lt;ref name = williams123/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade (1959b), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen versions of ''Candide'' from 1759, in the original French, are known today, and there has been great controversy over which is the earliest.&lt;ref name = williams123/&gt; More versions were published in other languages: ''Candide'' was translated once into Italian and thrice into English that same year.&lt;ref name=davidson5253&gt;Davidson (2005), pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; The complicated science of calculating the relative publication dates of all of the versions of ''Candide'' is described at length in Wade's article &quot;The First Edition of ''Candide'': A Problem of Identification&quot;. The publication process was extremely secretive, likely the &quot;most clandestine work of the century&quot;, because of the book's obviously illicit and irreverent content.&lt;ref name = wade1959/&gt; The greatest number of copies of ''Candide'' were published concurrently in [[Geneva]] by [[Cramer brothers|Cramer]], in [[Amsterdam]] by [[Marc-Michel Rey]], in London by Jean Nourse, and in Paris by Lambert.&lt;ref name=wade1959&gt;Wade (1959a), pp. 63–88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moreau Monkeys crop.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1803 illustration of the two monkeys chasing their lovers. Candide shoots the monkeys, thinking they are attacking the women.]]
''Candide'' underwent one major revision after its initial publication, in addition to some minor ones. In 1761, a version of ''Candide'' was published that included, along with several minor changes, a major addition by Voltaire to the twenty-second chapter, a section that had been thought weak by the Duke of Vallière.&lt;ref&gt;Wade (1957), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The English title of this edition was ''Candide, or Optimism. Translated from the German of Dr. Ralph. With the additions found in the Doctor's pocket when he died at Minden, in the Year of Grace 1759.''&lt;ref name=bair&gt;Voltaire [1759] (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; The last edition of ''Candide'' authorised by Voltaire was the one included in Cramer's 1775 compilation, ''l'éditions encadrées'', meaning &quot;supervised editions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1979), p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1997), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--==== Illustrations ====--&gt;
Voltaire strongly opposed the inclusion of [[illustrations]] in his works, as he stated in a 1778 letter to writer and publisher [[Charles Joseph Panckoucke]]:

{{bquote|Je crois que des Estampes seraient fort inutiles. Ces colifichets n'ont jamais été admis dans les éditions de Cicéron, de Virgile et d'Horace.}}

{{bquote|I believe that these illustrations will prove quite useless. These baubles have never been allowed in the works of [[Cicero]], [[Virgil]] and [[Horace]].&lt;ref name=bellhouse780&gt;Bellhouse (2006), p. 780&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite this protest, two sets of illustrations for ''Candide'' were produced by French artist [[Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune]]. The first version was done, at Moreau's own expense, in 1787 and included in Kehl's publication of that year, ''Oeuvres Complètes de Voltaire''.&lt;ref name=bellhouse756&gt;Bellhouse (2006), p. 756&lt;/ref&gt; Four images were drawn by Moreau for this edition and were engraved by Pierre-Charles Baquoy.&lt;ref name=bellhouse757&gt;Bellhouse (2006), p. 757&lt;/ref&gt; The second version, in 1803, consisted of seven drawings by Moreau which were transposed by multiple engravers.&lt;ref name=bellhouse769&gt;Bellhouse (2006), p. 769&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth-century modern artist [[Paul Klee]] relates it was while reading ''Candide'' that he discovered his own artistic style. Klee illustrated the work, and his drawings were published in a 1920 version edited by [[Kurt Wolff]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldinger (1987), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
''Candide'' contains thirty [[episode|episodic]] chapters, which may be grouped into two main schemes: one consists of two divisions, separated by the protagonist's hiatus in [[El Dorado]], the other consists of three parts, each defined by its geographical setting. By the former scheme, the first half of ''Candide'' constitutes the [[rising action]] and the last part the [[falling action|resolution]]. This view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest, reminiscent of adventure and [[picaresque]] novels, which tend to employ such a [[dramatic structure]].&lt;ref name=williams2627&gt;Williams (1997), pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; By the latter scheme, the thirty chapters may be grouped into three parts each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale: I–X are set in Europe, XI–XX are set in the [[Americas]], and XXI–XXX are set in Europe and the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name=Beck203&gt;Beck (1999), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leister (1985), pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire's additions of 1761.

=== Chapters I–X ===
The tale of ''Candide'' begins in the castle of the Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh in [[Westphalia]], home to the Baron's daughter, Lady Cunégonde; his [[Illegitimacy|bastard]] nephew, Candide; a tutor, Pangloss; a [[chambermaid]], Paquette; and the rest of the Baron's family. The [[protagonist]], Candide is romantically attracted to Cunégonde. He is a child of &quot;the most unaffected simplicity,&quot; whose face is &quot;the index of his mind.&quot;&lt;ref name = aldridge251254/&gt; Dr. Pangloss, professor of &quot;''métaphysico-théologo-cosmolonigologie''&quot; and self-proclaimed optimist, teaches his pupils that they live in the &quot;[[best of all possible worlds]]&quot; and that &quot;all is for the best.&quot;

[[File:VoltaireCandidFrontis+Chap01-1762.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece and first page of chapter one of an early English translation by T. Smollett et al of Voltaire's &quot;Candide,&quot; printed by J. Newbery, 1762]]
All is well in the castle until Cunégonde sees Pangloss sexually engaged with Paquette in some bushes. Encouraged by this show of affection, Cunégonde drops her handkerchief next to Candide which entices him to kiss her. For this infraction, Candide is evicted from the castle, at which point he is captured by Bulgar ([[Prussia]]n) recruiters and coerced into military service, where he is [[Flagellation|flogged]], nearly executed, and forced to participate in a major battle between the Bulgars and the Abares (an [[allegory]] representing the Prussians and the French). Candide eventually escapes the army and makes his way to Holland where he is given aid by Jacques, an [[Anabaptist]], who strengthens Candide's optimism. Soon after, Candide finds his master Pangloss, now a beggar with [[syphilis]]. Pangloss reveals he was infected with this disease by Paquette and shocks Candide by relating how Castle Thunder-ten-Tronckh was destroyed by Bulgars, and that Cunégonde and her whole family were killed. Pangloss is cured of his illness by Jacques, losing one eye and one ear in the process, and the three set sail to [[Lisbon]].

In Lisbon's harbor, they are overtaken by a vicious storm which destroys the boat. Jacques attempts to save a sailor, and is in the process thrown overboard. The sailor makes no move to help the drowning Jacques, and Candide is in a state of despair until Pangloss explains to him that Lisbon harbor was created in order for Jacques to drown. Only Pangloss, Candide, and the &quot;brutish sailor&quot; who let Jacques drown &lt;ref name=&quot;Smollett 2008, Ch. 4&quot;&gt;Smollett (2008), Ch. 4. (Fr. &quot;''matelot furieux''&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; survive the wreck and reach Lisbon, which is promptly hit by an earthquake, tsunami and fire which kill tens of thousands. The sailor leaves in order to loot the rubble while Candide, injured and begging for help, is lectured on the optimistic view of the situation by Pangloss.

The next day, Pangloss discusses his optimistic philosophy with a member of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], and he and Candide are arrested for heresy, set to be tortured and killed in an &quot;[[auto de fe|auto-da-fé]]&quot; set up to appease God and prevent another disaster. Candide is flogged and sees Pangloss hanged, but another earthquake intervenes and he escapes. He is approached by an old woman,&lt;ref&gt;Smollett (2008), Ch. 10. (Fr. &quot;''la vieille''&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; who leads him to a house where Lady Cunégonde waits, alive. Candide is surprised: Pangloss had told him that Cunegonde had been raped and disemboweled. She had been, but Cunégonde points out that people survive such things. However, her rescuer sold her to a Jewish merchant who was then threatened by a corrupt [[Grand Inquisitor]] into sharing her. Her owners arrive, find her with another man, and Candide kills them both. Candide and the two women flee the city, heading to the Americas.&lt;ref name = ayer143145/&gt; Along the way, Cunégonde falls into self-pity, complaining of all the misfortunes that have befallen her. The old woman reciprocates by revealing her own tragic life, which included having a buttock cut off in order to feed some starving men.

=== Chapters XI–XX ===
The trio arrive in [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Ayres]], where Governor Don Fernando d’Ibaraa, y Figueora, y Mascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza, asks to marry Cunégonde. Just then, an [[alcalde]] (a Portuguese fortress commander) arrives, pursuing Candide for killing the Grand Inquisitor. Leaving the women behind, Candide flees to [[Paraguay]] with his practical and heretofore unmentioned manservant, Cacambo.

[[File:Moreau Sucre crop.jpg|left|thumb|1787 illustration of Candide and Cacambo meeting a maimed slave of the sugar mill near Suriname]]
At a [[border post]] on the way to Paraguay, Cacambo and Candide speak to the [[commandant]], who turns out to be Cunégonde's unnamed brother. He explains that after his family was slaughtered, the [[Jesuit]]s' preparation for his burial revived him, and he has since joined the order.&lt;ref name = ayer143145/&gt; When Candide proclaims he intends to marry Cunégonde, her brother attacks him, and Candide stabs him through with his rapier. After lamenting all the people (mainly priests) he's killed, he and Cacambo flee. In their flight, Candide and Cacambo come across two naked women being chased and bitten by a pair of monkeys. Candide, seeking to protect the women, shoots and kills the monkeys, but is informed by Cacambo that the monkeys and women were probably lovers.

Cacambo and Candide are captured by Oreillons, the fictional inhabitants of the area. Mistaking Candide for a [[Jesuit]] by his robes, the Oreillons prepare to cook Candide and Cacambo; however, Cacambo convinces the Oreillons that Candide killed a Jesuit to procure the robe. Cacambo and Candide are released and travel for a month on foot and then down a river by canoe, living on fruits and berries.

After a few more adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander into [[El Dorado]], a geographically isolated [[utopia]] where the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, and all of the king's jokes are funny.&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge (1975), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.

Candide and Cacambo eventually reach [[Surinam]], where they split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Ayres to retrieve Lady Cunégonde, while Candide prepares to travel to Europe to await the two. Candide's remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Surinam, Candide feels in need of companionship, so he interviews a number of local men who have been through various ill-fortunes and settles on a man named Martin.

=== Chapters XXI–XXX ===

This companion, Martin, is a [[Manichean]] [[scholar]] based on the real-life pessimist [[Pierre Bayle]], who was a chief opponent of Leibniz.&lt;ref&gt;Wootton (2000), p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;  For the remainder of the voyage, Martin and Candide argue about philosophy, Martin painting the entire world as occupied by fools. Candide, however, remains an optimist at heart, since it is all he knows. As they arrive in England, they see an admiral (based on [[John Byng|Admiral Byng]]) being shot for not killing enough of the enemy. Martin explains that Britain finds it necessary to shoot an admiral from time to time &quot;pour l'encouragement des autres&quot; (to encourage the others).&lt;ref&gt;This is one of the most famous quotes from the novel. See [http://www.spectator.co.uk/alexmassie/3258671/pour-encourager-les-autres-oui-monsieur.thtml Pour encourager les autres? Oui, monsieur... – The Spectator]&lt;/ref&gt; Candide, horrified, arranges for them to leave Britain immediately. After various scenes satirising other European institutions, Candide and Martin meet Paquette, the chambermaid who infected Pangloss with his syphilis, in Venice. She is now a prostitute, and is spending her time with a monk, Brother Giroflée. Although both appear happy on the surface, they reveal their despair: Paquette has led a miserable existence as a sexual object, and the monk detests the religious order in which he was indoctrinated.

Later, while Candide and Martin are eating supper, Cacambo returns to Candide and informs him that Cunégonde is in [[Constantinople]], and that she has been enslaved. She is now washing dishes for a prince of [[Transylvania]], and has become ugly. On the way to rescue her, Candide finds Pangloss and Cunégonde's brother rowing in the galley. Candide buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices.&lt;ref name=ayer143145&gt;Ayer (1986), pp. 143–145&lt;/ref&gt; The baron and Pangloss relate how they survived, but despite the horrors he has been through, Pangloss's optimism remains unshaken: &quot;I still hold to my original opinions, because, after all, I'm a philosopher, and it wouldn't be proper for me to recant, since Leibniz cannot be wrong, and since [[Pre-established harmony|preestablished harmony]] is the most beautiful thing in the world, along with the [[Plenism|plenum]] and [[Subtle body|subtle matter]].&quot;&lt;ref name=bair107108&gt;Voltaire [1759] (1959), pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

The travellers arrive on the Ottoman coast where they rejoin Cunégonde and the old woman. Cunégonde has indeed become hideously ugly but Candide nevertheless buys their freedom and marries Cunégonde to spite her brother. Paquette and Brother Giroflée, too, are reconciled with Candide on a farm which he just bought with the last of his finances.

One day, the protagonists seek out a [[dervish]] known as a great philosopher of the land. Pangloss asks him why Man is made to suffer so, and what they all ought to do. The dervish responds by asking rhetorically why Pangloss is concerned about the existence of evil and good. The dervish describes human beings as mice on a ship sent by a king to Egypt; their comfort does not matter to the king. The dervish then slams his door on the group. Returning to their farm, Candide, Pangloss, and Martin meet a [[Turkish people|Turk]] whose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs. He and his four children work a small farm to keep &quot;free of three great evils: boredom, vice and necessity&quot;, or &quot;poverty&quot; as per John Butt's 1947 translation. Candide, Pangloss, Martin, Cunégonde, Paquette, Cacambo, the old woman, and Brother Giroflée all set to work (on this &quot;''louable dessein''&quot;, or &quot;commendable plan&quot;, as the narrator calls it), each to one specific task. Candide ignores Pangloss's insistence that all turned out for the best by necessity, instead telling him &quot;we must cultivate our garden&quot;.&lt;ref name=bair113&gt;Voltaire [1759] (1959), p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==

As Voltaire himself described it, the purpose of ''Candide'' was to &quot;bring amusement to a small number of men of wit&quot;.&lt;ref name = aldridge251254/&gt; The author achieves this goal by combining his sharp wit with a fun parody of the classic adventure-romance plot. Candide is confronted with horrible events described in painstaking detail so often that it becomes humorous. Literary theorist Frances K. Barasch described Voltaire's matter-of-fact narrative as treating topics such as mass death &quot;as coolly as a weather report&quot;.&lt;ref name=barasch3&gt;Barasch (1985), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The fast-paced and improbable plot—in which characters narrowly escape death repeatedly, for instance—allows for compounding tragedies to befall the same characters over and over again.&lt;ref name=starobinski194&gt;Starobinski (1976), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, ''Candide'' is primarily, as described by Voltaire's biographer Ian Davidson, &quot;short, light, rapid and humorous&quot;.&lt;ref name = davidson54/&gt;&lt;ref name=wade1959b133&gt;Wade (1959b), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the playful façade of ''Candide'' which has amused so many, there lies very harsh criticism of contemporary European civilization which angered many others. European governments such as France, Prussia, Portugal and England are each attacked ruthlessly by the author: the French and Prussians for the Seven Years' War, the Portuguese for their [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition]], and the British for the execution of [[John Byng]]. Organised religion, too, is harshly treated in ''Candide''. For example, Voltaire mocks the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit order]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Aldridge provides a characteristic example of such anti-clerical passages for which the work was banned: while in [[Paraguay]], Cacambo remarks, &quot;[The Jesuits] are masters of everything, and the people have no money at all&amp;nbsp;…&quot;. Here, Voltaire suggests the [[mission (Christian)|Christian mission]] in Paraguay is taking advantage of the local population. Voltaire depicts the Jesuits holding the indigenous peoples as slaves while they claim to be helping them.&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge (1975), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ayer139&quot;/&gt;

=== Satire ===

The main method of ''Candide''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s satire is to contrast ironically great tragedy and comedy.&lt;ref name = davidson54/&gt; The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws.&lt;ref name=&quot;starobinski194&quot;/&gt; Thus ''Candide'' derides optimism, for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events with no apparent redeeming qualities.&lt;ref name = aldridge251254/&gt;&lt;ref name=barasch3/&gt;

A simple example of the satire of ''Candide'' is seen in the treatment of the historical event witnessed by Candide and Martin in [[Portsmouth]] harbour. There, the duo spy an anonymous admiral, supposed to represent [[John Byng]], being executed for failing to properly engage a French fleet. The admiral is blindfolded and shot on the deck of his own ship, merely &quot;to encourage the others&quot; (Fr.'' &quot;Pour encourager les autres&quot;''). This depiction of military punishment trivializes Byng's death. The dry, pithy explanation &quot;to encourage the others&quot; thus satirises a serious historical event in characteristically Voltairian fashion. For its classic wit, this phrase has become one of the more often quoted from ''Candide''.&lt;ref name=davidson54/&gt;&lt;ref name=havens843&gt;Havens (1973), p. 843&lt;/ref&gt;

Voltaire depicts the worst of the world and his pathetic hero's desperate effort to fit it into an optimistic outlook. Almost all of ''Candide'' is a discussion of various forms of evil: its characters rarely find even temporary respite. There is at least one notable exception: the episode of [[El Dorado]], a fantastic village in which the inhabitants are simply rational, and their society is just and reasonable. The positivity of El Dorado may be contrasted with the pessimistic attitude of most of the book. Even in this case, the bliss of El Dorado is fleeting: Candide soon leaves the village to seek Cunégonde, whom he eventually marries only out of spite.&lt;ref name = aldridge251254/&gt;&lt;ref name=barasch3/&gt;
&lt;!--
==== Picaresque ====--&gt;

Another element of the satire focuses on what William F. Bottiglia, author of many published works on ''Candide'', calls the &quot;sentimental foibles of the age&quot; and Voltaire's attack on them.&lt;ref name=bottiglia8992&gt;Bottiglia (1968), pp. 89–92&lt;/ref&gt; Flaws in European culture are highlighted as ''Candide'' parodies adventure and romance clichés, mimicking the style of a [[picaresque novel]].&lt;ref name=bottiglia8992/&gt; A number of archetypal characters thus have recognisable manifestations in Voltaire's work: Candide is supposed to be the drifting [[rogue (vagrant)|rogue]] of low [[class structure|social class]], Cunégonde the sex interest, Pangloss the knowledgeable mentor and Cacambo the skilful valet.&lt;ref name=aldridge251254&gt;Aldridge (1975), pp. 251–254&lt;/ref&gt; As the plot unfolds, readers find that Candide is no rogue, Cunégonde becomes ugly and Pangloss is a stubborn fool. The characters of ''Candide'' are unrealistic, two-dimensional, mechanical, and even [[marionette]]-like; they are simplistic and stereotypical.&lt;ref name=wade1959b303&gt;Wade (1959b), pp. 303–305&lt;/ref&gt; As the initially naïve protagonist eventually comes to a mature conclusion—however noncommittal—the novella is a ''[[bildungsroman]]'', if not a very serious one.&lt;ref name = aldridge251254/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldinger (1987), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Garden motif ===

Gardens are thought by many critics to play a critical symbolic role in ''Candide''. The first location commonly identified as a garden is the castle of the Baron, from which Candide and Cunégonde are evicted much in the same fashion as [[Adam and Eve]] are evicted from the [[Garden of Eden]] in ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]''. Cyclically, the main characters of ''Candide'' conclude the novel in a garden of their own making, one which might represent celestial paradise. The third most prominent &quot;garden&quot; is [[El Dorado]], which may be a false Eden.&lt;ref&gt;''Readings on Candide'' (2001), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Other possibly symbolic gardens include the [[Jesuit]] pavilion, the garden of Pococurante, Cacambo's garden, and the Turk's garden.&lt;ref name=bottiglia727&gt;Bottiglia (1951), pp. 727, 731&lt;/ref&gt;

These gardens are likely references to the Garden of Eden, but it has also been proposed, by Bottiglia, for example, that the gardens refer also to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', and that Candide's conclusion to cultivate &quot;his garden&quot; symbolises Voltaire's great support for this endeavour. Candide and his companions, as they find themselves at the end of the novella, are in a very similar position to Voltaire's tightly knit philosophical circle which supported the ''Encyclopédie'': the main characters of ''Candide'' live in seclusion to &quot;cultivate [their] garden&quot;, just as Voltaire suggested his colleagues leave society to write. In addition, there is evidence in the epistolary correspondence of Voltaire that he had elsewhere used the metaphor of gardening to describe writing the ''Encyclopédie''.&lt;ref name=bottiglia727/&gt; Another interpretative possibility is that Candide cultivating &quot;his garden&quot; suggests his engaging only in necessary occupations, such as feeding oneself and fighting boredom. This is analogous to Voltaire's own view on gardening: he was himself a gardener at his estates in [[Les Délices]] and [[Ferney]], and he often wrote in his correspondence that gardening was an important pastime of his own, it being an extraordinarily effective way to keep busy.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (2005), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scherr&gt;Scherr (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge (1975), p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
=== Optimism ===

''Candide'' satirises various philosophical and religious theories that Voltaire had previously criticised. Primary among these is [[Leibniz]]ian [[optimism]] (sometimes called ''Panglossianism'' after its fictional proponent), which Voltaire ridicules with descriptions of seemingly endless calamity.&lt;ref name=davidson54&gt;Davidson (2005), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire demonstrates a variety of irredeemable evils in the world, leading many critics to contend that Voltaire's treatment of evil—specifically the theological problem of its existence—is the focus of the work.&lt;ref&gt;''Readings on Candide'' (2001), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily referenced in the text are the Lisbon earthquake, disease, and the sinking of ships in storms. Also, war, thievery, and murder—evils of human design—are explored as extensively in ''Candide'' as are environmental ills. Bottiglia notes Voltaire is &quot;comprehensive&quot; in his enumeration of the world's evils. He is unrelenting in attacking Leibnizian optimism.&lt;ref&gt;Bottiglia (1951), p. 720&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamental to Voltaire's attack is Candide's tutor Pangloss, a self-proclaimed follower of Leibniz and a teacher of his doctrine. Ridicule of Pangloss's theories thus ridicules Leibniz himself, and Pangloss's reasoning is silly at best. For example, Pangloss's first teachings of the narrative absurdly mix up cause and effect:

{{bquote|Il est démontré, disait-il, que les choses ne peuvent être autrement; car tout étant fait pour une fin, tout est nécessairement pour la meilleure fin. Remarquez bien que les nez ont été faits pour porter des lunettes; aussi avons-nous des lunettes.}}

{{bquote|It is demonstrable that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles, therefore we wear spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;Smollett (2008), Ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following such flawed reasoning even more doggedly than Candide, Pangloss defends optimism. Whatever their horrendous fortune, Pangloss reiterates &quot;all is for the best&quot; (Fr. &quot;''Tout est pour le mieux''&quot;) and proceeds to &quot;justify&quot; the evil event's occurrence. A characteristic example of such [[theodicy]] is found in Pangloss's explanation of why it is good that [[syphilis]] exists:

{{bquote|… c'était une chose indispensable dans le meilleur des mondes, un ingrédient nécessaire; car si Colomb n'avait pas attrapé dans une île de l'Amérique cette maladie qui empoisonne la source de la génération, qui souvent même empêche la génération, et qui est évidemment l'opposé du grand but de la nature, nous n'aurions ni le chocolat ni la cochenille; }}

{{bquote|… it was a thing unavoidable, a necessary ingredient in the best of worlds; for if Columbus had not caught in an island in America this disease, which contaminates the source of generation, and frequently impedes propagation itself, and is evidently opposed to the great end of nature, we should have had neither chocolate nor cochineal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smollett 2008, Ch. 4&quot;/&gt;}}

Candide, the impressionable and incompetent student of Pangloss, often tries to justify evil, fails, invokes his mentor and eventually despairs. It is by these failures that Candide is painfully cured (as Voltaire would see it) of his optimism.

Interestingly, this critique of Voltaire's seems to be directed almost exclusively at Leibnizian optimism. ''Candide'' does not ridicule Voltaire's contemporary [[Alexander Pope]], a later optimist of slightly different convictions. ''Candide'' does not discuss Pope's optimistic principle that &quot;all is right&quot;, but Leibniz's that states, &quot;this is the best of all possible worlds&quot;. However subtle the difference between the two, ''Candide'' is unambiguous as to which is its subject. Some critics conjecture that Voltaire meant to spare Pope this ridicule out of respect, although Voltaire's ''Poème'' may have been written as a more direct response to Pope's theories. This work is similar to ''Candide'' in subject matter, but very different to it in style: the ''Poème'' embodies a more serious philosophical argument than ''Candide''.&lt;ref name=aldridge251254&gt;Aldridge (1975), pp. 251–254, 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Temmer, I think, disagrees with this. However, he is in the minority, and is not primarily a Voltaire scholar… see:

=== Conclusion ===

The conclusion of the novella, in which Candide finally dismisses his tutor's optimism, leaves unresolved what philosophy the protagonist is to accept in its stead. This element of ''Candide'' has been written about voluminously, perhaps above all others. The conclusion is enigmatic and its analysis is contentious.&lt;ref&gt;Leister (1985), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Voltaire's chateau, Ferney.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Voltaire's estate at [[Ferney]]]]
Voltaire develops no formal, systematic philosophy for the characters to adopt.&lt;ref name=bottiglia2324&gt;Bottiglia (1951), pp. 723–724&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the novel may be thought of not as a philosophical alternative to optimism, but as a prescribed practical outlook (though ''what'' it prescribes is in dispute). Many critics have concluded that one minor character or another is portrayed as having the right philosophy. For instance, a number believe that Martin is treated sympathetically, and that his character holds Voltaire's ideal philosophy—pessimism. Others disagree, citing Voltaire's negative descriptions of Martin's principles and the conclusion of the work in which Martin plays little part.&lt;ref name=bottiglia726&gt;Bottiglia (1951), p. 726&lt;/ref&gt;

Within debates attempting to decipher the conclusion of ''Candide'' lies another primary ''Candide'' debate. This one concerns the degree to which Voltaire was advocating a pessimistic philosophy, by which Candide and his companions give up hope for a better world. Critics argue that the group's reclusion on the farm signifies Candide and his companions' loss of hope for the rest of the human race. This view is to be compared to a reading that presents Voltaire as advocating a [[meliorism|melioristic]] philosophy and a precept committing the travellers to improving the world through metaphorical gardening. This debate, and others, focuses on the question of whether or not Voltaire was prescribing passive retreat from society, or active industrious contribution to it.&lt;ref&gt;Leister (1985), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inside/outside controversy ===

Separate from the debate about the text's conclusion is the &quot;inside/outside&quot; controversy. This argument centers on the matter of whether or not Voltaire was actually prescribing anything. Roy Wolper, professor emeritus of English, argues in a revolutionary 1969 paper that ''Candide'' does not necessarily speak for its author; that the work should be viewed as a narrative independent of Voltaire's history; and that its message is entirely (or mostly) ''inside'' it. This point of view, the &quot;inside&quot;, specifically rejects attempts to find Voltaire's &quot;voice&quot; in the many characters of ''Candide'' and his other works. Indeed, writers have seen Voltaire as speaking through at least Candide, Martin, and the Turk. Wolper argues that ''Candide'' should be read with a minimum of speculation as to its meaning in Voltaire's personal life. His article ushered in a new era of Voltaire studies, causing many scholars to look at the novel differently.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Sturzer, Meyer (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolper (1969), pp. 265–277&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- this may be usable for beefing up the &quot;inside&quot; perspective --&gt;

Critics such as Lester Crocker, Henry Stavan, and Vivienne Mylne find too many similarities between ''Candide''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s point of view and that of Voltaire to accept the &quot;inside&quot; view; they support the &quot;outside&quot; interpretation. They believe that Candide's final decision is the same as Voltaire's, and see a strong connection between the development of the protagonist and his author.&lt;ref name=bottiglia719&gt;Bottiglia (1951), pp. 719–720&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars who support the &quot;outside&quot; view also believe that the isolationist philosophy of the Old Turk closely mirrors that of Voltaire. Others see a strong parallel between Candide's gardening at the conclusion and the gardening of the author.&lt;ref name=braun569571&gt;Braun, Sturzer &amp; Meyer (1988), pp. 569–571&lt;/ref&gt; Martine Darmon Meyer argues that the &quot;inside&quot; view fails to see the satirical work in context, and that denying that ''Candide'' is primarily a mockery of optimism (a matter of historical context) is a &quot;very basic betrayal of the text&quot;.&lt;ref name=braun574&gt;Braun, Sturzer &amp; Meyer (1988), p. 574&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crocker (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this may be usable for beefing up the &quot;outside&quot; perspective --&gt;

And what makes me cherish it is the disgust which has been inspired in me by the Voltairians, people who laugh about the important things! ''Was he laughing? Voltaire? He was screeching&amp;nbsp;…''&quot;
| source= Flaubert, ''Correspondance'', éd. Conard, II, 348; III, 219''&lt;ref name=&quot;Voltaire 1759 1931, p. vii&quot;/&gt;}}

Though Voltaire did not openly admit to having written the controversial ''Candide'' until 1768 (until then he signed with a pseudonym: &quot;''Monsieur le docteur Ralph''&quot;, or &quot;Doctor Ralph&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wade (1959b), p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;), his authorship of the work was hardly disputed. Immediately after publication, the work and its author were denounced by both secular and religious authorities, because the book openly derides government and church alike. It was because of such polemics that [[Omer-Louis-François Joly de Fleury]], who was [[Advocate General]] to the Parisian [[parlement]] when ''Candide'' was published, found parts of ''Candide'' to be &quot;contrary to religion and morals&quot;.&lt;ref name=mason1315/&gt;

Despite much official indictment, soon after its publication, ''Candide''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s irreverent prose was being quoted. &quot;Let us eat a Jesuit&quot;, for instance, became a popular phrase for its reference to a humorous passage in ''Candide''.&lt;ref name=mason3&gt;Mason (1992), ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of February 1759, the [[Grand Council of Geneva]] and the administrators of Paris had banned ''Candide''.&lt;ref name = williams123/&gt; ''Candide'' nevertheless succeeded in selling twenty thousand to thirty thousand copies by the end of the year in over twenty editions, making it a best seller. The Duke de La Vallière speculated near the end of January 1759 that ''Candide'' might have been the fastest-selling book ever.&lt;ref name=mason1315&gt;Mason (1992), pp. 13–15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1762, ''Candide'' was listed in the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'', the Roman Catholic Church's list of prohibited books.&lt;ref name=williams123&gt;Williams (1997), pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Bannings of ''Candide'' lasted into the twentieth century in the United States, where it has long been considered a seminal work of Western literature. At least once, ''Candide'' was temporarily barred from entering America: in February 1929, a US [[customs]] official in [[Boston]] prevented a number of copies of the book, deemed &quot;obscene&quot;,&lt;ref name=haight&gt;Haight (1970), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; from reaching a [[Harvard University]] French class. ''Candide'' was admitted in August of the same year; however by that time the class was over.&lt;ref name=haight/&gt; In an interview soon after ''Candide''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s detention, the official who confiscated the book explained the office's decision to ban it, &quot;…&amp;nbsp;But about 'Candide,' I'll tell you. For years we've been letting that book get by. There were so many different editions, all sizes and kinds, some illustrated and some plain, that we figured the book must be all right. Then one of us happened to read it. It's a filthy book&amp;nbsp;…&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs (1930), p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowerman (1931), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer (2002), p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

''Candide'' is the most widely read of Voltaire's many works,&lt;ref name=ayer139&gt;Ayer (1986), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; and it is considered one of the great achievements of [[Western literature]].&lt;ref name=aldridge260/&gt; However, ''Candide'' is not necessarily considered a true &quot;classic&quot;. According to Bottiglia, &quot;The physical size of ''Candide'', as well as Voltaire's attitude toward his fiction, precludes the achievement of artistic dimension through plenitude, autonomous '3D' vitality, emotional resonance, or poetic exaltation. ''Candide'', then, cannot in quantity of quality, measure up to the supreme classics.&quot;&lt;ref name=bott247&gt;Bottiglia (1959), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Bottiglia instead calls it a miniature classic, though others are more forgiving of its size.&lt;ref name=aldridge260/&gt;&lt;ref name=bott247/&gt; As the only work of Voltaire which has remained popular up to the present day,&lt;ref name=mason2&gt;Mason (1992), ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; ''Candide'' is listed in ''The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages''. It is included in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] collection ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Candide'' has had a significant influence on modern writers of [[black comedy|black humour]] such as [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline|Céline]], [[Joseph Heller]], [[John Barth]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], and [[Terry Southern]]. Its parody and picaresque methods have become favourites of black humorists.&lt;ref&gt;''Readings on Candide'' (2001), pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Brockden Brown]], an early American novelist, may have been directly affected by Voltaire, whose work he knew well. Mark Kamrath, professor of English, describes the strength of the connection between ''Candide'' and ''[[Edgar Huntly; or, Memoirs of a Sleep-Walker]]'' (1799): &quot;An unusually large number of parallels&amp;nbsp;… crop up in the two novels, particularly in terms of characters and plot.&quot; For instance, the protagonists of both novels are romantically involved with a recently orphaned young woman. Furthermore, in both works the brothers of the female lovers are Jesuits, and each is murdered (although under different circumstances).&lt;ref name=kamrath&gt;Kamrath (1991), pp. 5–14&lt;/ref&gt; Some twentieth-century novels that may have been influenced by ''Candide'' are [[dystopia]]n [[science-fiction]] works. [[Armand Mattelart]], a French critic, sees ''Candide'' in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]]'s ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', three canonical works of the genre. Specifically, Mattelart writes that in each of these works, there exist references to ''Candide''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s popularisation of the phrase &quot;the best of all possible worlds&quot;. He cites as evidence, for example, that the French version of ''Brave New World'' was entitled ''Le Meilleur des mondes'' (En. literally &quot;The best of worlds&quot;).&lt;ref name=monty5&gt;Monty (2006), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Readers of ''Candide'' often compare it with certain works of the modern genre the [[Theatre of the Absurd]]. Haydn Mason, a Voltaire scholar, sees in ''Candide'' a few similarities to this brand of literature. For instance, he notes commonalities of ''Candide'' and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' (1952). In both of these works, and in a similar manner, friendship provides emotional support for characters when they are confronted with harshness of their existences.&lt;ref name=mason3337&gt;Mason (1992), pp. 33, 37&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mason qualifies, &quot;…&amp;nbsp;the ''conte'' must not be seen as a forerunner of the 'absurd' in modern fiction. Candide's world is full of ridiculous and meaningless elements, but human beings are not totally deprived of the ability tomake [sic] sense out of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=mason98&gt;Mason (1992), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Pilling]], biographer of Beckett, does state that ''Candide'' was an early and powerful influence on Beckett's thinking.&lt;ref name=monty151&gt;Monty (2006), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--if necessary, this source includes another, perhaps stronger, example of an intertexutal reference by Beckett to ''Candide''--&gt;

In 1760, one year after Voltaire published ''Candide'', a sequel was published with the name ''[[Candide, Part II|Candide, ou l'optimisme, seconde partie]]''.&lt;ref name=astbury503&gt;Astbury (2005), p. 503&lt;/ref&gt; This work is attributed both to [[Thorel de Campigneulles]], a writer unknown today, and [[Henri Joseph Du Laurens]], who is suspected of having habitually plagiarised Voltaire.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1993), pp. VIII, IX&lt;/ref&gt; The story continues in this sequel with Candide having new adventures in the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Afsharid dynasty| Persia]], and [[History of Denmark#Absolutism|Denmark]]. ''Part II'' has potential use in studies of the popular and literary receptions of ''Candide'', but is almost certainly [[apocrypha]]l.&lt;ref name=astbury503&gt;Astbury (2005), p. 503&lt;/ref&gt; In total, by the year 1803, at least ten imitations of ''Candide'' or continuations of its story were published by authors other than Voltaire.&lt;ref name=mason1315/&gt;
[[File:Leonard Bernstein NYWTS 1955.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Leonard Bernstein]] in 1955]]

[[Candide (operetta)|''Candide'' the operetta]] was originally conceived by playwright [[Lillian Hellman]], as a play with incidental music. [[Leonard Bernstein]], the American [[composer]] and [[Conductor (music)|conductor]] who wrote the music was so excited about the project that he convinced Hellman to do it as a &quot;comic operetta&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Peyser (1987), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Many lyricists worked on the show, including [[James Agee]], [[Dorothy Parker]], [[John La Touche (musician)|John Latouche]], [[Richard Wilbur]], Leonard and [[Felicia Bernstein]], and Hellman. [[Hershy Kay]] orchestrated all the pieces except for the [[overture]], which Bernstein did himself.&lt;ref name = peyser248/&gt;

''Candide'' first opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] as a [[musical theatre|musical]] on 1 December 1956. The premier production was directed by [[Tyrone Guthrie]] and conducted by [[Samuel Krachmalnick]].&lt;ref name=peyser248&gt;Peyser (1987), p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; While this production was a box office flop, the music was highly praised, and an original cast album was made. The album gradually became a cult hit, but Hellman's libretto was criticised as being too serious an adaptation of Voltaire's novel.&lt;ref&gt;Peyser (1987), pp. 249–251&lt;/ref&gt; ''Candide'' would be more popular seventeen years later with a new libretto by [[Hugh Wheeler]].

''[[Candido ovvero un sogno fatto in Sicilia]]'' (1977) or simply ''Candido'' is a book by [[Leonardo Sciascia]]. It was at least partly based on Voltaire's ''Candide'', although the actual influence of ''Candide'' on ''Candido'' is a hotly debated topic. A number of theories on the matter have been proposed. Proponents of one say that ''Candido'' is very similar to ''Candide'', only with a happy ending; supporters of another claim that Voltaire provided Sciascia with only a starting point from which to work, that the two books are quite distinct.&lt;ref name=morrison59&gt;Morrison (2002), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burns (2000), p. 992&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nedim Gürsel]] wrote his 2001 novel ''Le voyage de Candide à Istanbul'' about a minor passage in ''Candide'' during which its protagonist meets [[Ahmed III]], the deposed [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[sultan]]. This chance meeting on a ship from [[Venice]] to [[Istanbul]] is the setting of Gürsel's book.&lt;ref name=hitchins160&gt;Hitchins (2002), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Southern]], in writing his popular novel ''[[Candy (novel)|Candy]]'' with [[Mason Hoffenberg]] adapted ''Candide'' for a modern audience and changed the protagonist from male to female. ''Candy'' deals with the rejection of a sort of optimism which the author sees in women's magazines of the modern era; ''Candy'' also parodies [[pornography]] and [[popular psychology]]. This adaptation of ''Candide'' was itself adapted for the cinema by director [[Christian Marquand]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=silva784785&gt;Silva (2000), pp. 784–785&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above, ''Candide'' was made into a number of minor films and theatrical adaptations throughout the twentieth century. For a list of these, see ''Voltaire: Candide ou L'Optimisme et autres contes'' (1989) with preface and commentaries by Pierre Malandain.&lt;ref&gt;Malandain (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

FILM: ___ 1960 Norbert Carbonnaux. ''Candide (The Twentieth Century Optimist)'' &lt;ref name=silva783&gt; Silva (2000), p. 783&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (1774) by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] is often seen as a reaction to ''Candide'', dealing as it does with the loss, rather than the recovery of a paradisal situation. Werther's tale goes so far as to begin, rather than end, with a garden, whereas it ends, not with a humble continuation of life, but with a melodramatic and grandiose seeking of death.

The surreal film ''[[O Lucky Man!]]'' directed by [[Lindsay Anderson]] in 1973, is often considered a reappropriation of ''Candide''.{{fact|date=November 2010}} It narrates the story of a young idealist who tries to ignore the evils of the world, coming into conflict thereby with his own true desires and concepts of happiness. Other adaptations of ''Candide'' include a modern version in ''X Out of Wonderland'' (2005) by [[David Allan Cates]].&lt;ref&gt; Cates (2005) &lt;/ref&gt; There is also the much older adaptation ''[[Fanfluche]]'' (1892) by [[Quatrelles]].&lt;ref&gt; Gullette (1934), pp. 93–107&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;
In May 2009, a play called &quot;Optimism,&quot; based on ''Candide'' opened at the [[CUB Malthouse Theatre]] in [[Melbourne]]. It followed the basic storyline of ''Candide'', incorporating anachronisms, music and [[stand up comedy]] from comedian [[Frank Woodley]]. It toured Australia and played at the [[Edinburgh International Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Boztas (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chapterhouse: Dune''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by [[Frank Herbert]], last in his series of six ''[[Dune universe|Dune]]'' novels. Published in 1985, it is also known variously as ''Chapterhouse Dune'', ''Chapter House Dune'' and ''Chapter House: Dune''. 

==Plot introduction==
The [[Bene Gesserit]] still find themselves questioning the [[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]] of humanity set by the [[Leto Atreides II|God Emperor Leto II]]. Now they must survive the [[Honored Matres]], whose reckless conquest of the [[Old Empire (Dune)|Old Empire]] threatens Bene Gesserit survival. The Sisters must reassess their timeless methods: does ultimate survival go beyond calculated manipulation? Is there greater purpose to life than consolidating power?

==Plot summary==

The situation is desperate for the Bene Gesserit as they find themselves the targets of the Honored Matres, whose conquest of the Old Empire is almost complete. The Matres are seeking to assimilate the technology and developed methods of the Bene Gesserit. In charge is Mother Superior [[Darwi Odrade]], who must create a plan to fight the Honored Matres. The Bene Gesserit are creating a new [[Arrakis|Dune]] on the planet Chapterhouse. [[Sheeana]], in charge of the project, expects a [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]] soon. The Honored Matres conquest destroyed the [[Bene Tleilax]], with only a single Tleilaxu Master remaining, [[Scytale (Dune)|Scytale]], albeit in Bene Gesserit captivity. He yields a secret of the Tleilaxu: [[ghola]] production. The first ghola produced is that of [[Miles Teg]]. The Bene Gesserit have two other prisoners on Chapterhouse: [[Duncan Idaho]] and [[Murbella]]. The Bene Gesserit have accepted Murbella as a novice and are training her to be a Sister, despite their suspicion that she intends to escape back to the Honored Matres. 

[[Lampadas]], a center for Bene Gesserit education, has been destroyed by the Honored Matres.  One Sister, [[Lucilla (Dune)|Lucilla]], manages to escape. She carries the shared-minds of millions of [[Reverend Mother (Dune)|Reverend Mothers]]. Lucilla is forced to land on [[Giedi Prime|Gammu]] where she seeks refuge with an underground group of [[Jews]]. The [[Rabbi]] gives Lucilla sanctuary, but to save his organization he must deliver her to the Matres. Before doing so, he reveals [[Rebecca (Dune)|Rebecca]], a &quot;wild&quot; Reverend Mother who has gained her [[Other Memory]] without Bene Gesserit training. Lucilla shares minds with Rebecca, who promises to take the memories of Lampadas safely back to the Sisterhood. Lucilla is then &quot;betrayed&quot;, and taken before the [[Great Honored Matre]] [[Dama (Dune)|Dama]], who tries to persuade her to join the Honored Matres, preserving her life in exchange for Bene Gesserit secrets. However, Dama fails and kills Lucilla in the end.

Back on Chapterhouse, Odrade confronts Duncan Idaho and forces him to admit that he is a Mentat, proving he retains memories of many ghola lives. He does not reveal his mysterious visions of two people. Meanwhile, Murbella collapses under the pressure of Bene Gesserit training, giving in to &quot;word weapons&quot; that the Bene Gesserit planted to undermine her earlier Honored Matre identity. Murbella realizes that she wants to be Bene Gesserit and is initiated in. Odrade relaxes the strictures, and for the first time ever, a man &amp;mdash; Duncan &amp;mdash; is allowed to watch a spice ceremony. Odrade believes that the Bene Gesserit made a mistake in fearing emotion, and that in order to evolve, the Bene Gesserit must learn to accept emotions. Murbella, Odrade is pleased to find, takes and survives the hard path to becoming a Reverend Mother. 

Odrade then confronts Sheeana, discovering that Duncan and Sheeana have been allied together for some time. Sheeana does not reveal that they have been considering the option of reawakening Teg's memory through [[Imprinting (psychology)|Imprinting]], nor does Odrade discover that Sheeana has the keys to Duncan's no-ship prison. Odrade continues molding Scytale, with Sheeana showing him a baby sandworm, the Bene Gesserit's own long term supply of spice, and destroying Scytale's main bargaining card. Finally, Teg is awakened by Sheeana using imprinting techniques. Odrade appoints him again as [[Bashar]] of the military forces of the Sisterhood for the assault on the Honored Matres. 

Odrade next calls a meeting of all the Bene Gesserit, announcing her plan to attack the Honored Matres. She tells them that this attack will be led by Teg. She also announces candidates to succeed her as Mother Superior; she will share her memories with Murbella and Sheeana before she leaves. Odrade then goes to meet the Great Honored Matre. Under cover of Odrade's diplomacy, the Bene Gesserit forces under Teg attack Gammu with tremendous force. Teg uses his secret ability to see no-ships to secure control of the system. Survivors of the attack flee to Junction, and Teg follows them there and carries all with him. Victory for the Bene Gesserit seems inevitable. In the midst of this battle, the Jews (including Rebecca with her precious memories) take refuge with the Bene Gesserit fleet.

[[Logno]] &amp;mdash; chief advisor to Dama &amp;mdash; assassinates Dama with poison and assumes control of the Honored Matres. Her first act surprises Odrade greatly. Too late Odrade and Teg realize they have fallen into a trap, and the Honored Matres use a mysterious weapon to turn defeat into victory, as well as capturing Odrade. Murbella saves as much of the Bene Gesserit force as she can and they begin to withdraw to Chapterhouse. Odrade, however, had planned for the possible failure of the Bene Gesserit attack and left Murbella instructions for a last desperate gamble. Murbella pilots a small craft down to the surface, announcing herself as an Honored Matre who, in the confusion, has managed to escape the Bene Gesserit with all their secrets. She arrives on the planet and is taken to the Great Honored Matre. Unable to control her anger, Logno attacks but is killed by Murbella. Awed by her physical prowess, the remaining Honored Matres are forced to accept her as their new leader. Odrade is also killed in the melee and Murbella shares memories with her, thereby also becoming Reverend Mother Superior.

Murbella's ascension to leadership is not accepted as victory by all the Bene Gesserit. Some flee Chapterhouse, notably Sheeana, who has a vision of her own, and is joined by Duncan. The two escape in the giant no-ship, with Scytale, Teg and the Jews. Murbella recognizes their plan at the last minute, but is powerless to stop them. Watching this escape with interest are [[Daniel and Marty]], the observers Duncan had been having visions of. The story ends on a cliffhanger with several questions left unanswered regarding the merging of the Honored Matres and Bene Gesserit, the fates of those on the escaped no-ship (including the role of Scytale, the development of Idaho and Teg, and the role of the Jews), the identity of the god-like characters in the book's final chapter and the ultimate mystery of what chased the Honored Matres back into the Old Empire.

==Sequels==

Two decades later, Herbert's son [[Brian Herbert]], along with [[Kevin J. Anderson]], published two [[sequel]]s &amp;ndash; ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' (2006) and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'' (2007) &amp;ndash; based on notes left behind by Frank Herbert for what he referred to as ''Dune 7'', his own planned seventh novel in the ''Dune'' series.{{Herbert notes}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:PCIExpress.jpg|right|250px|thumb|4 [[PCI Express]] bus card slots (from top to bottom: x4, x16, x1 and x16), compared to a 32-bit [[conventional PCI]] bus card slot (very bottom)]]

In [[computer architecture]], a '''bus'''  is a subsystem that transfers data between components inside a [[computer]], or between computers.

Early computer buses were literally parallel electrical wires with multiple connections, but the term is now used for any physical arrangement that provides the same logical functionality as a parallel electrical bus. Modern computer buses can use both parallel and bit-serial connections, and can be wired in either a [[multidrop]] (electrical parallel) or [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] topology, or connected by switched hubs, as in the case of [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]].

==History==
===First generation===
Early [[computer]] buses were bundles of wire that attached [[computer memory]] and peripherals. Anecdotally termed the &quot;''digit trunk''&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;See the early Australian [[CSIRAC]] computer&lt;/ref&gt; they were named after electrical power buses, or [[busbar]]s.  Almost always, there was one bus for memory, and another for peripherals,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}&lt;!-- Early computers did not use a single &quot;peripheral bus&quot;: see [[I/O channel]] --&gt; and these were accessed by separate instructions, with completely different timings and protocols.

One of the first complications was the use of [[interrupt]]s.  Early computer programs performed [[Input/output|I/O]] by [[Busy waiting|waiting in a loop]] for the peripheral to become ready.  This was a waste of time for programs that had other tasks to do.  Also, if the program attempted to perform those other tasks, it might take too long for the program to check again, resulting in loss of data. Engineers thus arranged for the peripherals to interrupt the CPU.  The interrupts had to be prioritized, because the CPU can only execute code for one peripheral at a time, and some devices are more time-critical than others.

[[Image:Computer system bus.svg |thumb|right|400px |Single [[system bus]] ]]
To provide modularity, memory and I/O buses can be combined into a unified [[system bus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The essentials of computer organization and architecture |author1=Linda Null |author2=Julia Lobur |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year=2006 |isbn=9780763737696 |edition=2nd |pages= 33,179–181 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=QGPHAl9GE-IC&amp;pg=PA33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) further reduced cost for mass-produced [[minicomputer]]s, and [[Memory-mapped I/O|mapped peripherals]] into the memory bus, so that the input and output devices appeared to be memory locations.  This was implemented in the [[Unibus]] of the [[PDP-11]] around 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= A New Architecture for Mini-Computers—The DEC PDP-11 |author1= C. Gordon Bell |author2= R. Cady |author3= H. McFarland |author4= B. Delagi |author4= J. O'Laughlin |author5= R. Noonan |author6= W.

Later computer programs began to share memory common to several CPUs.  Access to this memory bus had to be prioritized, as well.
The classic, simple way to prioritize interrupts or bus access was with a [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]].

Early [[microcomputer]] bus systems were essentially a passive [[backplane]] connected directly or through buffer amplifiers to the pins of the [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. Memory and other devices would be added to the bus using the same address and data pins as the CPU itself used, connected in parallel.  Communication was controlled by the CPU, which had read and written data from the devices as if they are blocks of memory, using the same instructions, all timed by a central clock controlling the speed of the CPU. Still, devices [[interrupt]]ed the CPU by signaling on separate CPU pins.
&lt;!--not all buses are synchronous even on microprocessors, DTAK on 68000 e.g. --&gt;
For instance, a [[disk drive]] controller would signal the CPU that new data was ready to be read, at which point the CPU would move the data by reading the &quot;memory location&quot; that corresponded to the disk drive. Almost all early microcomputers were built in this fashion, starting with the [[S-100 bus]] in the [[Altair 8800]] computer system.

In some instances, most notably in the [[IBM PC]], although similar physical architecture can be employed, instructions to access peripherals (&lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt;) and memory (&lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt; and others) have not been made uniform at all, and still generate distinct CPU signals, that could be used to implement a separate I/O bus.

These simple bus systems had a serious drawback when used for general-purpose computers.  All the equipment on the bus has to talk at the same speed, as it shared a single clock.

Increasing the speed of the CPU becomes harder, because the speed of all the devices must increase as well. When it is not practical or economical to have all devices as fast as the CPU, the CPU must either enter a [[wait state]], or work at a slower clock frequency temporarily,&lt;ref name=&quot;bray-aug&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last= Bray|first=Andrew C.|coauthors= Dickens, Adrian C.; Holmes, Mark A.|title= The Advanced User Guide for the BBC Microcomputer|url= http://www.nvg.org/bbc/doc/BBCAdvancedUserGuide-PDF.zip|format= zipped PDF|accessdate= 2008-03-28|year= 1983|publisher= Cambridge Microcomputer Centre|location= Cambridge, UK|isbn= 0-946827-00-1|pages= 442–443|chapter= 28. The One Megahertz bus}}&lt;/ref&gt; to talk to other devices in the computer. While acceptable in [[embedded systems]], this problem was not tolerated for long in general-purpose, user-expandable computers.

Such bus systems are also difficult to configure when constructed from common off-the-shelf equipment.  Typically each added [[expansion card]] requires many [[Jumper (computing)|jumpers]] in order to set memory addresses, I/O addresses, interrupt priorities, and interrupt numbers.

===Second generation===
&quot;Second generation&quot; bus systems like [[NuBus]] addressed some of these problems. They typically separated the computer into two &quot;worlds&quot;, the CPU and memory on one side, and the various devices on the other. A ''bus controller'' accepted data from the CPU side to be moved to the peripherals side, thus shifting the communications protocol burden from the CPU itself. This allowed the CPU and memory side to evolve separately from the device bus, or just &quot;bus&quot;. Devices on the bus could talk to each other with no CPU intervention. This led to much better &quot;real world&quot; performance, but also required the cards to be much more complex. These buses also often addressed speed issues by being &quot;bigger&quot; in terms of the size of the data path, moving from 8-bit [[parallel bus]]es in the first generation, to 16 or 32-bit in the second, as well as adding software setup (now standardised as [[Plug-n-play]]) to supplant or replace the jumpers.

However these newer systems shared one quality with their earlier cousins, in that everyone on the bus had to talk at the same speed. While the CPU was now isolated and could increase speed without fear, CPUs and memory continued to increase in speed much faster than the buses they talked to. The result was that the bus speeds were now very much slower than what a modern system needed, and the machines were left starved for data. A particularly common example of this problem was that [[video card]]s quickly outran even the newer bus systems like [[PCI Local Bus|PCI]], and computers began to include [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] just to drive the video card. By 2004 AGP was outgrown again by high-end video cards and other peripherals and has been replaced by the new [[PCI Express]] bus.

An increasing number of external devices started employing their own bus systems as well. When disk drives were first introduced, they would be added to the machine with a card plugged into the bus, which is why computers have so many slots on the bus. But through the 1980s and 1990s, new systems like [[SCSI]] and [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] were introduced to serve this need, leaving most slots in modern systems empty. Today there are likely to be about five different buses in the typical machine, supporting various devices.

=== Third generation ===
&quot;Third generation&quot; buses have been emerging into the market since about 2001, including [[HyperTransport]] and [[InfiniBand]]. They also tend to be very flexible in terms of their physical connections, allowing them to be used both as internal buses, as well as connecting different machines together. This can lead to complex problems when trying to service different requests, so much of the work on these systems concerns software design, as opposed to the hardware itself. In general, these third generation buses tend to look more like a [[Computer network|network]] than the original concept of a bus, with a higher protocol overhead needed than early systems, while also allowing multiple devices to use the bus at once.

Buses such as [[Wishbone (computer bus)|Wishbone]] have been developed by the [[open source hardware]] movement in an attempt to further remove legal and patent constraints from computer design.

==Description of a bus==
At one time, &quot;bus&quot; meant an electrically parallel system, with electrical conductors similar or identical to the pins on the CPU. This is no longer the case, and modern systems are blurring the lines between buses and networks.

Buses can be [[parallel communications|parallel buses]], which carry data words in parallel on multiple wires, or [[serial bus]]es, which carry data in bit-serial form. The addition of extra power and control connections, differential drivers, and data connections in each direction usually means that most serial buses have more conductors than the minimum of one used in the [[1-Wire]] and [[UNI/O]] serial buses. As data rates increase, the problems of [[timing skew]], power consumption, electromagnetic interference and [[crosstalk]] across parallel buses become more and more difficult to circumvent. One partial solution to this problem has been to [[double pumped|double pump]] the bus. Often, a serial bus can actually be operated at higher overall data rates than a parallel bus, despite having fewer electrical connections, because a serial bus inherently has no timing skew or crosstalk.  [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[FireWire]], and [[Serial ATA]] are examples of this.  [[Network_topology#Bus|Multidrop]] connections do not work well for fast serial buses, so most modern serial buses use [[Daisy chain (information technology)#Computer hardware|daisy-chain]] or hub designs.

Most computers have both internal and external buses.  An ''internal bus'' connects all the internal components of a computer to the motherboard (and thus, the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and [[internal memory]]). These types of buses are also referred to as a [[local bus]], because they are intended to connect to local devices, not to those in other machines or external to the computer. An ''external bus'' connects external peripherals to the motherboard.

[[computer network|Network]] connections such as [[Ethernet]] are not generally regarded as buses, although the difference is largely conceptual rather than practical. The arrival of technologies such as [[InfiniBand]] and [[HyperTransport]] is further blurring the boundaries between networks and buses. Even the lines between internal and external are sometimes fuzzy, [[I²C]] can be used as both an internal bus, or an external bus (where it is known as [[ACCESS.bus]]), and InfiniBand is intended to replace both internal buses like [[PCI Local Bus|PCI]] as well as external ones like [[Fibre Channel]].  In the typical desktop application, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] serves as a peripheral bus, but it also sees some use as a networking utility and for connectivity between different computers, again blurring the conceptual distinction.

==Bus topology==
In a network, the master scheduler controls the data traffic. If data is to be transferred, the requesting computer sends a message to the scheduler, which puts the request into a queue. The message contains an identification code which is broadcast to all nodes of the network. The scheduler works out priorities and notifies the receiver as soon as the bus is available.

The identified node takes the message and performs the data transfer between the two computers. Having completed the data transfer the bus becomes free for the next request in the scheduler's queue.

* Advantage: Any computer can be accessed directly and messages can be sent in a relatively simple and fast way.
* Disadvantage: A scheduler is required to organize the traffic by assigning frequencies and priorities to each signal.

'''Chinese checkers''' (alternative spelling '''Chinese chequers''') is a [[board game]] that can be played by two to six people. According to Hoyle® Puzzle &amp; Board Games User Guide, five people can not play, because one player wouldn't have an opponent opposite him or her. It is a variant of [[Halma]]; the objective of the game is to place one's pieces in the corner opposite their starting position of a pitted [[hexagram]] by single moves or jumps over other pieces.

== History ==
Despite being called “Chinese Checkers”, the game did not originate in [[China]] or any part of [[Asia]], nor is it a variation of [[Draughts|checkers]]. (The less well-known game &quot;[[Chinese chess]]&quot;, or ''xiangqi'', is from China.) The game was invented in Germany in 1892 under the name “Stern-Halma”, as a variation on the older American game of [[Halma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Johns&quot;&gt;Bernardo Johns, Stephanie; ''The Ethnic Almanac''. Doubleday Publishing (1981). ISBN 0385141432&lt;/ref&gt; The “Stern” ([[German language|German]] for ''star'') refers to the star-shape of the board (in contrast with the square board of Halma). The ''name'' “Chinese checkers” originated in the [[United States]], as a marketing scheme by Bill and Jack Pressman in 1928. The Pressman company's game was originally called &quot;Hop Ching Checkers&quot;.

(The game was mostly introduced to Chinese-speaking regions by the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johns&quot; /&gt;)

==Hop across==
[[Image:Chinese checkers jump.svg|thumb|180px|Standard jumps can have multiple hops, but each hop must be directly adjacent.]]

The aim of the game is simply to enter all of one's ten marbles into the opposite &quot;Home base&quot; (star point) on the opposite side of the board before any other player in the game finishes entering his/her pieces likewise.

In the &quot;hop across&quot;, most popular variation, each player puts his or her own colored marbles on one of the six points or corners of the star and attempts to relocate them all to the opposite corner. Players take turns moving one marble, either by moving it one single adjacent step or moving a chain of one or any other number of available hops or 'jumps', as they are often called. A step consists of moving a marble to an adjacent unoccupied space in any of the six available directions. In the diagram at right, Green might move the topmost marble diagonally one space down and to the left. A hop consists of jumping directly over a single adjacent marble, either one's own or an opponent's, to the unoccupied space directly over and beyond the adjacent marble. In the diagram at right, Red might advance the indicated marble by a chain of three hops in one single move. It is not mandatory to advance the marble by as many hops as is possible in the chain. In some instances a player may choose to stop the move part way through the chain to impede the opponent's progress or to align their marbles for planned future moves.

Essentially, the basic strategy is to find the longest hopping path that leads closest to, or immediately into, the &quot;home&quot; base (star point) on the opposite side of the board instead of moving step by step, as it obviously requires fewer moves to finish when using multiple jumps in one single move. However, since one or more players can make use of whatever hopping 'ladders' an opponent creates, more advanced strategy requires a player hindering opposing players in addition to helping himself or herself find jumps across the board. Of equal importance are the players' strategies for emptying and filling their origin and destination triangles. Games between experts are rarely decided by more than a couple of moves.

In the fast-paced variant, which is played mainly in [[Mainland China]], game pieces may hop over ''non-adjacent'' pieces. A hop consists of jumping over a distant marble to a symmetrical position on the opposite side. For example, if there are two empty spaces between the moving marble and the marble over which it is hopping, it lands on the opposite side with a gap of two empty spaces. As before, a single move may be a chain of hops, as shown in the diagram at left.

Usually, in the fast paced version, a marble is allowed to enter into an empty corner in the middle of a series of hops but must hop out again before the move is over.

Jumping over two marbles in a single hop is not allowed. Therefore, in this variant even more than in the original version, it is sometimes strategically important to keep one's marbles bunched in order to prevent a long opposing hop.

An alternate variant allows hops over any symmetrical arrangement, including pairs of pieces, pieces separated by spaces, and so on.

In a five player game, the situation mimics the six player game except that one player moves toward the unoccupied corner. Because this player is in an advantageous position, usually a weaker player would take that position.

The four player game is same as the six player game except two opposite corners are unused.

In a three player game, all players play either one or two sets of marbles each. If one set is used, the game pieces are moved across the field into an empty corner. If two sets are used, each player starts with two color sets at opposite corners.

In a two player game, each player plays one, two or three sets of marbles. If one set is played, the pieces usually go into the opponent's corner. If two sets are played, the pieces can either go into the player's own opposite corners or into the opponent's corner. If three sets are played, the pieces usually go to the opponent's corners.

Each layout takes different game strategy. For example, if a player's pieces go to that player's own corner, the player can arrange his or her own pieces to serve as bridges between the two opposite ends. On the contrary, if a player's opponent occupies that player's target corner, the player might have to play a waiting game until all of the pieces are moved out.

==Capture==

In the &quot;capture&quot; variation all sixty game pieces are put in the [[hexagon]]al field in the center of the game board. The one hole in the center of the board is left unoccupied so that the game board starts out with a symmetrical hexagonal pattern. The players take turns hopping any game pieces over other game pieces on the board; the hopped over pieces are captured (retired from the game, as in the traditional [[English draughts|American incarnation of checkers]]) and collected in the player's bin.

At the end of the game, the player with the most captured pieces is the winner. The board is tightly packed at the start of the game; as more pieces are captured, the board frees up and multiple captures can often take place in one move. In this game, two or more players can participate. There is no upper limit to the number of players in this game, but if there are more than six players, not everyone will get a fair turn.

The fast-paced version of this game allows the game pieces to catapult over multiple empty spots (just as described in hop-across above). The original version only allows small hops like in checkers.

'''Cantor Fitzgerald L.P.''' is a global [[financial services]] firm specializing in [[Bond (finance)|bond trading]].

The firm is one of twenty [[primary dealers]] who trade [[Treasury security|U.S. government securities]] directly with the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/pridealers_current.html Primary Dealers List]&quot;, Federal Reserve Bank of New York&lt;/ref&gt; and is also involved in [[investment banking]], [[asset management]], [[market data]], and [[brokerage]] services.

Now headquartered in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.cantor.com/contact/location Locations].&quot; Cantor Fitzgerald. Retrieved on October 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; it was formerly based in the [[World Trade Center]] - and was particularly hard hit by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

==September 11, 2001 attacks==

Retrieved on October 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; on the 101st-105th floors of [[World Trade Center|One World Trade Center]] in [[Lower Manhattan]] (2-6 floors above the impact zone of a [[American Airlines Flight 11|hijacked airliner]]), were destroyed during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. Cantor Fitzgerald lost 658 employees (all of the employees in the office at the time of the attacks), or about two-thirds of its workforce, considerably more than any other of the [[List of World Trade Center tenants|World Trade Center tenants]] or the [[New York City Police Department]] and [[New York City Fire Department]]. The company was able to bring its trading markets back online within a week, and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and [[chairman]] Howard Lutnick, whose brother was among those killed, vowed to keep the company alive. 

On September 19, Cantor Fitzgerald made a pledge to distribute 25 percent of the firm's profits for the next five years, and committed to paying for ten years of health care, for the benefit of the families of its 658 former Cantor Fitzgerald, eSpeed, and TradeSpark employees (profits which would otherwise have been distributed to the Cantor Fitzgerald [[Partnership|partners]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot;&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39038466/ns/us_news-911_nine_years_later/ns/us_news-911_nine_years_later?GT1=43001&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the company completed its promise, having paid a total of $180&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot; /&gt; (and an additional $17&amp;nbsp;million from a relief fund run by Lutnick's sister, Edie).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Before the attacks, Cantor handled about one-quarter of the daily transactions in the multi-trillion dollar [[treasury security]] market. Cantor has since rebuilt its [[infrastructure]] and now has its headquarters in [[midtown Manhattan]]. The company's effort to regain its footing is the subject of [[Tom Barbash]]'s 2003 book ''On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, and 9/11: A Story of Loss and Renewal''.

On September 2, 2004, Cantor filed a [[Lawsuit|civil lawsuit]] against the [[Saudi Arabia|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], one of a number of organizations to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3646548.stm WTC agency sues Saudis over 9/11], BBC News Online, 11th September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It was later joined in the suit by the [[Port Authority of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1094073283938 Port Authority to Join Suit Against Saudi Arabia Over 9/11 Attack], Associated Press, 13th September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the first attack, at approximately 8:46:46&amp;nbsp;AM, six seconds after the first plane hit the tower, a Goldman Sachs server sent out an alert page stating that a [[Goldman Sachs]] trading system server had gone offline because it was unable to interface with a Cantor server.&lt;ref&gt;[http://911.wikileaks.org/files/messages_2001_09_11-08_45_2001_09_11-08_49.html#407 2001-09-11 08:46:46 Arch [1612975&amp;#93; D ALPHA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egads!

The '''Cane Toad''' (''Bufo marinus''), also known as the '''Giant Neotropical Toad''' or '''Marine Toad''', is a large, terrestrial [[true toad]] native to [[Central America|Central]] and South America, but has since been [[Introduced species|introduced]] to various islands throughout [[Oceania]] and the [[Caribbean]]. It is a member of the subgenus ''[[Rhinella]]'' of the [[genus]] ''[[Bufo]]'', which includes many different true toad [[species]] found throughout Central and South America. The cane toad is a prolific breeder; females lay single-clump [[spawn (biology)|spawn]]s with thousands of [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. Its reproductive success is partly because of opportunistic feeding: it has a diet, unusual among [[Frog|Anurans]], of both dead and living matter. Adults average {{convert|10|–|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length; the largest recorded specimen weighed 2.65 kilograms (5.8&amp;nbsp;lb) with a length of {{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} from snout to vent.

The cane toad has poison [[gland]]s, and the [[tadpole]]s are highly toxic to most animals if ingested. Because of its voracious appetite, the cane toad has been introduced to many regions of the Pacific and the Caribbean islands as a method of agricultural [[pest control]]. The species derives its common name from its use against the [[cane beetle]] (''Dermolepida albohirtum''). The cane toad is now considered a pest and an [[invasive species]] in many of its introduced regions; of particular concern is that its toxic skin kills many animals—native predators and otherwise—when ingested.

==Taxonomy==

Originally, cane toads were used to eradicate pests from [[sugar cane]], giving rise to their common name. The cane toad has many other common names, including &quot;Giant Toad&quot; and &quot;Marine Toad&quot;; the former refers to its size and the latter to the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]], ''Bufo marinus''. It was one of many species described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his 18th-century work ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735).&lt;ref name=&quot;Linnaeus1758p824&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Linnaeus|1758|p=824}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus based the [[specific epithet]] ''marinus'' on an illustration by Dutch zoologist [[Albertus Seba]], who mistakenly believed the cane toad to inhabit both terrestrial and marine environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;beltz2007&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Beltz|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common names include &quot;Giant Neotropical Toad&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Easteal1985p185&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Easteal|van Beurden|Floyd|Sabath|1985|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Dominican Toad&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;InvasiveSpeciesInfo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Cane Toad (Bufo marinus) | work = National Invasive Species Information Center | publisher = [[United States Department of Agriculture]] | date = June 15, 2009 | url = http://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/animals/canetoad.shtml | accessdate = June 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Giant Marine Toad&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Caughley1996&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Caughley|Gunn|1996|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;South American Cane Toad&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSIROBiodiversity&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Australian State of the Environment Committee|2002|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Trinidad]]ian English they are commonly called &quot;Crapaud&quot;, the French word for toad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenny2008&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kenny|2008|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cane-toad.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large, adult cane toad, showing the light colouration that is present in some specimens of the species.|A lightly coloured cane toad]]
In Australia, the adults may be confused with large native frogs from the genera ''[[Limnodynastes]]'', ''[[Cyclorana]]'' and ''[[Barred frogs|Mixophyes]]''. These species can be distinguished from the cane toad by the absence of large [[parotoid gland]]s behind their eyes and the lack of a ridge between the nostril and the eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;VanderduysEric2000p1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vanderduys|Wilson|2000|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cane toads have been confused with the [[Giant Burrowing Frog]] (''Heleioporus australiacus''), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) [[iris (anatomy)|iris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BurrowingFrogAustralianMuseum&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Giant Burrowing Frog | work = Wildlife of Sydney | publisher = [[Australian Museum]] | date = April 15, 2009 | url = http://australianmuseum.net.au/Giant-Burrowing-Frog | accessdate = June 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile cane toads may be confused with species of the ''[[Uperoleia]]'' genus, but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright colouring on the groin and thighs.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarkerGriggTyler1995p381&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|Grigg|Tyler|1995|p=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the cane toad closely resembles many Bufonid species. In particular, it could be confused with the [[Southern toad]] (''Bufo terrestris''), which can be distinguished by the presence of two bulbs in front of the parotoid glands.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrandtMazzotti2005&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brandt|Mazzotti|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Young Bufo marinus.jpg|thumb|right|A young cane toad ''(Bufo marinus)''|alt=A juvenile cane toad, showing many of the features of the adult toads, but without the large parotoid glands.]]
The cane toad is very large;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson1998&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; the females are significantly longer than males,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee2001p928&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|2001|page=928}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching an average length of {{convert|10|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson1998&quot; /&gt; &quot;Prinsen&quot;, a toad kept as a pet in Sweden, is listed by the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the largest recorded specimen. It reportedly weighed 2.65&amp;nbsp;kilograms (5.84&amp;nbsp;lb) and measured {{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} from snout to vent, or {{convert|54|cm|in|abbr=on}} when fully extended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wyse1007p249&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wyse|1997|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger toads tend to be found in areas of lower population density.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p117&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a life expectancy of 10 to 15 years in the wild,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p117-118&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|pages=117&amp;ndash;118}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can live considerably longer in captivity, with one specimen reportedly surviving for 35 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grenard2007p55&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Grenard|2007|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skin of the cane toad is dry and warty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson1998&quot; /&gt; It has distinct ridges above the eyes, which run down the snout.&lt;ref name=&quot;VanderduysEric2000p1&quot; /&gt; Individual cane toads can be grey, yellowish, red-brown or olive-brown, with varying patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cameron2009&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Cameron|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large parotoid gland lies behind each eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson1998&quot; /&gt; The ventral surface is cream-coloured and may have blotches in shades of black or brown. The pupils are horizontal and the irises golden.&lt;ref name=&quot;BurrowingFrogAustralianMuseum&quot; /&gt; The toes have a fleshy webbing at their base,&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson1998&quot; /&gt; and the fingers are free of webbing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cameron2009&quot; /&gt;

The juvenile cane toad is much smaller than the adult cane toad at {{convert|5|-|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. Typically, they have smooth, dark skin, although some specimens have a red wash. Juveniles lack the adults' large parotoid glands, so they are usually less poisonous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p117&quot; /&gt;  The [[tadpole]]s are small and uniformly black, and are bottom-dwellers, tending to form [[Swarm|schools]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1976p81&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1976|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tadpoles range from {{convert|10|to|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name=&quot;issgBufoMarinus&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Invasive Species Specialist Group|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology, behaviour and life history==
{{external media|topic=Toad Call|audio1=[http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/caribbean/wildlife-facts/2006/wildlife-facts_sounds_2006/sapo_comun.wav Cane toad Vocals]}}
The common name &quot;Marine Toad&quot; and the scientific name ''Bufo marinus'' suggest a link to [[marine biology|marine life]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p116&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the adult cane toad is entirely terrestrial, only venturing to freshwater to breed. [[Tadpole]]s have been found to tolerate salt concentrations equivalent to at most 15% that of [[seawater]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ely1944p256&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ely|1944|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cane toad inhabits open grassland and woodland, and has displayed a &quot;distinct preference&quot; for areas that have been modified by humans, such as gardens and drainage ditches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their native habitats, the toads can be found in subtropical forests,&lt;ref name=&quot;issgBufoMarinus&quot; /&gt; although dense foliage tends to limit their dispersal.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarkerGriggTyler1995p380&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Barker|Grigg|Tyler|1995|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cane toad begins life as an egg, which is laid as part of long strings of jelly in water. A female lays 8,000&amp;ndash;25,000 eggs at once and the strings can stretch up to {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} in length.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p116&quot; /&gt; The black eggs are covered by a membrane and their diameter is approximately {{convert|1.7|-|2.0|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p116&quot; /&gt; The rate at which an egg evolves into a tadpole is dependent on the temperature: the pace of development increases with temperature. Tadpoles typically hatch within 48 hours, but the period can vary from 14 hours up to almost a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p116&quot; /&gt; This process usually involves thousands of tadpoles—which are small, black and have short tails—forming into groups. It takes between 12 and 60 days for the tadpoles to develop into toadlets, with four weeks being typical.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p116&quot; /&gt; Similarly to their adult counterparts, eggs and tadpoles are toxic to many animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson1998&quot; /&gt; 

When they emerge, toadlets typically are about {{convert|10|–|11|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and grow rapidly. While the rate of growth varies by region, time of year and gender, Zug and Zug found an average initial growth rate of {{convert|0.647|mm|in|abbr=on}} per day, followed by an average rate of {{convert|0.373|mm|in|abbr=on}} per day. Growth typically slows once the toads reach sexual maturity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZugZug1979pp14-15&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zug|Zug|1979|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rapid growth is important for their survival—in the period between metamorphosis and sub–adulthood, the young toads lose the toxicity that protected them as eggs and tadpoles, but have yet to fully develop the parotoid glands that produce [[bufotoxin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ZugZug1979p15&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zug|Zug|1979|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they lack this key defence, it is estimated that only 0.5% of cane toads reach adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p117&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anstis2002p274&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Anstis|2002|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with rates of growth, the point at which the toads become sexually mature varies across different regions. In New Guinea, sexual maturity is reached by female toads with a snout–vent length of between {{convert|70|and|80|mm|in|abbr=on}}, while toads in [[Panama]] achieve maturity when they are between {{convert|90|and|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZugZug1979p8&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zug|Zug|1979|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tropical regions, such as their native habitats, breeding occurs throughout the year, but in subtropical areas, breeding occurs only during warmer periods that coincide with the onset of the [[wet season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cane toad is estimated to have a critical thermal maximum of {{convert|40|-|42|C|F}} and a minimum of around {{convert|10|-|15|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p118&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ranges can change due to adaptation to the local environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p119&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cane toad has a high tolerance to water loss&amp;mdash;one study showed that some can withstand a 52.6% loss of body water, allowing them to survive outside tropical environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p119&quot; /&gt;

===Diet===

Most frogs identify prey by movement, and vision appears to be the primary method by which the cane toad detects prey; however, the cane toad can also locate food using its sense of smell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p10&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; They eat a wide range of material; in addition to the normal prey of small [[rodent]]s, [[reptile]]s, other [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s and a range of [[invertebrate]]s, they also eat plants, dog food and household refuse. Cane toads have a habit of swallowing their prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989pp130-132&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|pages=130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bufo marinus01e.jpg|thumb|left|A specimen of ''Bufo marinus'' from [[El Salvador]]. The large parotoid glands are visible behind the eyes.|alt=An adult cane toad with dark colouration, as found in El Salvador. The parotoid gland is prominently displayed on the side of the head.]]

===Defences===

The adult cane toad has enlarged parotoid glands behind the eyes, and other glands across their back. When the toads are threatened, their glands secrete a milky-white fluid known as [[bufotoxin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p134&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Components of bufotoxin are toxic to many animals;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989pp134-136&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|pages=134–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; there have even been human deaths due to the consumption of cane toads.&lt;ref name=&quot;issgBufoMarinus&quot; /&gt;

[[Bufotenin]], one of the chemicals excreted by the cane toad, is classified as a Class 1 drug under Australian law, alongside [[heroin]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. It is thought that the effects of bufotenin are similar to that of mild poisoning; the stimulation, which includes mild [[hallucination]]s, lasts for less than an hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fawcett2004-08-04p9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fawcett|2004|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the cane toad excretes bufotenin in small amounts, and other toxins in relatively large quantities, [[Psychoactive toad|toad licking]] could result in serious illness or death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weil1994pp1-8&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Weil|Davis|1994|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to releasing toxin, the cane toad is capable of inflating its lungs, puffing up and lifting its body off the ground to appear taller and larger to a potential predator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p134&quot; /&gt;

===Predators===

Many species prey on the cane toad in its native habitat.

==Distribution==

The cane toad is native to the Americas, and its range stretches from the [[Rio Grande Valley]] in southern [[Texas]] to the central [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and south-eastern [[Peru]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p111&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZugZug1979p1-2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zug|Zug|1979|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area encompasses both [[tropics|tropical]] and [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] environments. The density of the cane toad is significantly lower within its native distribution than in places where it has been introduced. In South America, the density was recorded to be 20 adults per 100&amp;nbsp;metres (109&amp;nbsp;yards) of shoreline, 50–100 times lower than the density in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;LampoDeLeo1998p392&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lampo|De Leo|1998|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introductions==

The cane toad has been introduced to many regions of the world&amp;mdash;particularly the Pacific&amp;mdash;for the biological control of agricultural pests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p111&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; These introductions have generally been well documented, and the cane toad may be one of the most studied of any introduced species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Easteall981p94&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Easteal|1981|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the early 1840s, the cane toad had been introduced into [[Martinique]] and [[Barbados]], from [[French Guiana]] and [[Guyana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Easteal1981p96&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Easteal|1981|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; An introduction to [[Jamaica]] was made in 1844 in an attempt to reduce the rat population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lannoo2005p417&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lannoo|2005|page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its failure to control the rodents, the cane toad was introduced to [[Puerto Rico]] in the early 20th century in the hope that it would counter a beetle infestation that was ravaging the sugarcane plantations. The Puerto Rican scheme was successful and halted the economic damage caused by the beetles, prompting scientists in the 1930s to promote it as an ideal solution to agricultural pests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p112-113&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, many countries in the Pacific region emulated the lead of Puerto Rico and introduced the toad in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p113-114&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are introduced populations in Australia, [[Florida]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2005p433-441&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2005|pages=433–441}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papua New Guinea]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ZugLindgremPippet1975p31-50&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zug|Lindgrem|Pippet|1975|pages=31–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philippines]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Alcala1957p90-96&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Alcala|1957|pages=90–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Ogasawara Islands|Ogasawara]] and [[Ryukyu Islands]] of Japan,&lt;ref name=&quot;KideraEtAl2008p423-440&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kidera|Tandavanitj|Oh|Nakanishi|2008|pages=423–440}}&lt;/ref&gt; most Caribbean islands,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p113-114&quot;/&gt; [[Fiji]] and many other Pacific islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p113-114&quot;/&gt; including Hawaii.&lt;ref name=&quot;OliverShaw1953p65-95&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Oliver|Shaw|1953|pages=65–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinckley1963p253-259&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinckley|1963|pages=253–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the cane toad has become a pest in many host countries, and poses a serious threat to native animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p113&quot; /&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Cane toads in Australia}}
[[File:Bufo marinus australian range.png|thumb|right|Distribution of the cane toad in Australia|alt=A map of Australia with the cane toad's distribution highlighted. The area follows the north-eastern coast of Australia, ranging from the Northern Territory through to the top end of New South Wales.]]
Following the apparent success of the cane toad in eating the beetles that were threatening the sugarcane plantations of Puerto Rico, and the fruitful introductions into Hawaii and the Philippines, there was a strong push for the cane toad to be released in Australia to negate the pests that were ravaging the Queensland cane fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1976p77&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1976|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, 102 toads were collected from Hawaii, equally comprising males and females, and brought to Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Easteall981p104&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Easteal|1981|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an initial release in August 1935, the Commonwealth Department of Health decided to ban future introductions until a study was conducted into the feeding habits of the toad. The study was completed in 1936 and the ban lifted, at which point large scale releases were undertaken&amp;mdash;by March, 1937, 62,000 toadlets had been released into the wild.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1976p77&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1976|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Easteall981p104&quot; /&gt; The toads became firmly established in Queensland, increasing exponentially in number and extending their range into the [[Northern Territory]] and [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cameron2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Easteall981p104&quot; /&gt; Recently, the toads have made their way into Western Australia and one has even been found on the far western coast in [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/cane-toads-found-on-wa-coast.htm/ Cane toads found on WA coast], Australian Geographic, July 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the toad was generally unsuccessful in reducing the targeted beetles, in part because the cane fields provided insufficient shelter for the predators during the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1976p83&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1976|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its original introduction, the cane toad has had a particularly marked effect on Australian [[biodiversity]]. The population of a number of native predatory reptiles has declined, such as the [[Monitor lizard|varanid]] lizards ''[[Varanus mertensi]]'', ''[[Varanus mitchelli|V. mitchelli]]'' and ''[[Varanus panoptes|V. panoptes]]'', the land snakes ''[[Pseudechis australis]]'' and ''[[Acanthophis antarcticus]]'', and the crocodile species ''[[Crocodylus johnstoni]]''; in contrast, the population of the [[agamidae|agamid]] lizard ''[[Amphibolurus gilberti]]''&amp;mdash;known to be a prey item of ''V. panoptes''&amp;mdash;has increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoodyEtAl2009p46-53&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Doody|Green|Rhind|Castellano|2009|pages=46–53}}. On snake populations see {{Harvnb|Shine|2009|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caribbean===

The cane toad was introduced to various Caribbean islands to counter a number of pests that were infesting local crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p67&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was able to establish itself on some islands, such as [[Barbados]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Puerto Rico]], other introductions, such as in [[Cuba]] before 1900 and in 1946, and on the islands of [[Dominica]] and [[Grand Cayman]], were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p73-74&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest recorded introductions were to Barbados and [[Martinique]]. The Barbados introductions were focused on the biological control of pests that were damaging the sugarcane crops,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p71&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while the toads became abundant, they have not been as successful in controlling the pests as in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;KennedyLever2001p72&quot;&gt;Kennedy, Anthony quoted in {{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toad was introduced to Martinique from [[French Guiana]] before 1944 and became established. Today, they reduce the [[mosquito]] and [[mole cricket]] populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p81&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third introduction to the region occurred in 1884, when toads appeared in Jamaica, reportedly imported from Barbados to help control the rodent population. While they had no significant effect on the [[rat]]s, they nevertheless became well established.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p78-79&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other introductions include the release on [[Antigua]]&amp;mdash;possibly before 1916, although there are suggestions that this initial population may have died out by 1934 and been reintroduced at a later date&amp;mdash;&lt;ref name=&quot;Easteal1981p98&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Easteal|1981|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montserrat]], which saw an introduction before 1879 that led to the establishment of a solid population, which was apparently sufficient to survive the [[Soufrière Hills|Soufrière Hills volcano]] eruption in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p81-82&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, the cane toad was introduced into Puerto Rico to control the populations of [[Phyllophaga (genus)|white-grub]] (''Phyllophaga'' spp.), a sugarcane pest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p112&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, the pests were manually collected by humans, so the introduction of the toad eliminated labor costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p112&quot; /&gt; A second group of toads was imported in 1923, and by 1932 the cane toad was well established.&lt;ref name=&quot;VanVolkenberg1935&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Volkenberg|1935|pages=278–279}}. &quot;After a completely successful method of killing white grubs by chemical means was found, the only opportunities for its use in Puerto Rico have been limited to small areas in pineapple plantations at elevations where the toad is even yet not present in sufficient abundance.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The population of white-grubs dramatically decreased,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p112&quot; /&gt; and this was attributed to the cane toad at the annual meeting of the International Sugar Cane Technologists in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p113&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there may have been other factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p113&quot; /&gt; The six-year period after 1931&amp;mdash;when the cane toad was most prolific, and the white-grub saw dramatic decline&amp;mdash;saw the highest ever rainfall for Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeland1985p211-215&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Freeland|1985|pages=211–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the assumption was that the cane toad controlled the white-grub; this view was reinforced by a ''[[Nature]]'' article titled &quot;Toads save sugar crop&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p113&quot; /&gt; and this led to large-scale introductions throughout many parts of the Pacific.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p113-115&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1989|pages=113–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the cane toad has been spotted in [[Carriacou]] and Dominica, the latter appearance occurring in spite of the failure of the earlier introductions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p72-73&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiji===

The cane toad was introduced into [[Fiji]] to combat insects that infested sugarcane plantations. The introduction of the cane toad to the region was first suggested in 1933, following the successes in Puerto Rico and Hawaii. After considering the possible side effects, the national government of Fiji decided to release the toad in 1953, and 67 specimens were subsequently imported from Hawaii.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p128-129&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the toads were established, a 1963 study concluded that as the toad's diet included both harmful and beneficial invertebrates, it was considered &quot;economically neutral&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinckley1963p253-259&quot; /&gt; Today the cane toad can be found on all major islands in Fiji, although they tend to be smaller than their counterparts in other regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p130-131&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Guinea===

The cane toad was successfully introduced into [[New Guinea]] to control [[hawk moth]] larvae that were eating [[sweet potato]] crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZugLindgremPippet1975p31-50&quot; /&gt; The first release occurred in 1937 using toads imported from Hawaii, with a second release the same year using specimens from the Australian mainland. Evidence suggests there was a third release in 1938, consisting of toads that were being used for human [[pregnancy test]]s&amp;mdash;many species of toad were found to be effective for this task, and were employed for approximately 20 years after the discovery was announced in 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;Easteall981p103&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Easteal|1981|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TylerWassersugSmith2007pp6-7&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|Wassersug|Smith|2007|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reports argued that the toads were effective in reducing the incidence of [[cutworm]] and it was suggested that sweet potato yields were improving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p118&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, these first releases were followed by further distributions across much of the region,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p118&quot; /&gt; although their effectiveness on other crops, such as cabbages, has been questioned&amp;mdash;when the toads were released at [[Wau, Papua New Guinea|Wau]], the cabbages provided insufficient shelter and the toads rapidly left the immediate area for the superior shelter offered by the forest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1976pp83-84&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1976|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar situation had previously arisen in the Australian cane fields, but this experience was either unknown or ignored in New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1976pp83-84&quot; /&gt; The cane toad has since become abundant in rural and urban areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p119&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

The cane toad naturally exists in southern [[Texas]], but attempts (both deliberate and accidental) have been made to introduce the species to other parts of the country. These include introductions to the mainland state of [[Florida]] and to the islands of Hawaii, as well as largely unsuccessful introductions to [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Easteal1981pp100-102&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Easteal|1981|pages=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial releases into Florida failed. Attempted introductions before 1936 and 1944, made with the objective of controlling sugarcane pests, were unsuccessful as the toads failed to proliferate. Later attempts failed in the same way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p57&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Easteal1981p100&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Easteal|1981|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the toad gained a foothold in the state after an accidental release by an importer at [[Miami International Airport]] in 1957, and deliberate releases by animal dealers in 1963 and 1964 established the toad in other parts of Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;Easteal1981p100&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p58&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the cane toad is well established in the state, from the [[Florida Keys]] to north of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], and they are gradually extending further northward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p59&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Florida, the toad is a regarded as a threat to both native species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wec.ufl.edu/extension/wildlife_info/frogstoads/bufo_marinus.php |title=Bufo Marinus @ Florida Wildlife Extension at UF/IFAS |publisher=Wec.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to pets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2007/nov/02/021636/poisonous-bufo-may-have-toad-hold-temple-terrace/ |title=Poisonous Bufo May Have Toad Hold On Temple Terrace |publisher=.tbo.com |date=2007-11-02 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  so much so that the [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission]] recommends that residents euthanize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/uw046 |title=WEC 11/UW046: Marine Toads (Bufo marinus) |publisher=Edis.ifas.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Cane Toad Products.jpg|thumb|right|Cane toad merchandise|alt=A selection of cane toad merchandise, including key rings made from their legs, a coin purse made from the head, front limbs and body of a toad, and a stuffed cane toad.]]

Around 150 cane toads were introduced to [[Oahu]] in Hawaii in 1932, and the population swelled to 105,517 after 17 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1989p113-114&quot;/&gt; The toads were sent to the other islands, and more than 100,000 toads were distributed by July 1934;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p64&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually over 600,000 were transported.&lt;ref name=&quot;Easteal1981p101&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Easteal|1981|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

Other than the previously mentioned use as a [[Biological pest control|biological control for pests]], the cane toad has been employed in a number of people commercial and non-commercial applications. Traditionally, within the toad's natural range in South America, the [[Embera-Wounaan]] would &quot;milk&quot; the toads for their toxin, which was then employed as an [[arrow poison]]. There are also suggestions that the toxins may have been used as a [[narcotic]] by the [[Olmec]] people. The toad has been hunted as a food source in parts of [[Peru]], and eaten after the removal of the skin and [[parotoid gland]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p32&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lever|2001|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the toad's toxins have been used in a number of new ways: [[bufotenin]] has been used in Japan as an [[aphrodisiac]] and a [[Baldness treatments|hair restorer]], and in [[cardiac surgery]] in China to lower the heart rates of patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;issgBufoMarinus&quot; /&gt;

Other modern applications of the cane toad include pregnancy testing,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p32&quot; /&gt; as pets,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mattison1987p145&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mattison|1987|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; laboratory research,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1976p85&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1976|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the production of [[leather]] goods. [[Pregnancy test]]ing was conducted in the mid-20th century by injecting urine from a woman into a male toad's [[Lymphatic system|lymph sacs]], and if [[spermatozoa]] appeared in the toad's urine, the patient was deemed to be pregnant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lever2001p32&quot; /&gt; The tests using toads were faster than those employing mammals; toads were easier to raise, and, although the initial 1948 discovery employed ''[[Bufo arenarum]]'' for the tests, it soon became clear that a variety of [[Frog|anuran]] species were suitable, including the cane toad. As a result, toads were employed in this task for approximately 20 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;TylerWassersugSmith2007pp6-7&quot; /&gt; As a [[Animal testing|laboratory animal]], the cane toad is regarded as ideal; they are plentiful, and easy and inexpensive to maintain and handle. The use of the cane toad in experiments started in 1950s, and by the end of 1960s, large numbers were being collected and exported to high schools and universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1976p85&quot; /&gt; Since then, a number of Australian states have introduced or tightened importation regulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1976pp88-89&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tyler|1976|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even dead toads have value. Cane toad skin has been made into leather and novelty items;&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarin2008p8&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|McCarin|2008|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardie2001p3&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardie|2001|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; stuffed cane toads, posed and accessorised, have found a home in the tourist market,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bateman2008p48&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bateman|2008|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts have been made to produce [[fertilizer]] from their bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAP2006&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Australian Associated Press|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Croquet''' is a [[lawn game]], played both as a recreational [[pastime]] and as a competitive [[sport]]. It involves hitting plastic or wooden [[ball]]s with a [[Mallet#Sport|mallet]] through [[hoop]]s embedded into the grass playing court.

==History==

[[File:Pall Mall - Project Gutenberg eText 14315.jpg|thumbnail|left|150px|'''Pall mall''' illustrated in ''Old English Sports, Pastimes and Customs'', published 1891. Original image by Lauthier 1717]]

The oldest document to bear the word &quot;croquet&quot; with a description of the modern game is the set of rules registered by [[Isaac Spratt]] in November 1856 with the Stationers' Company in London. This record is now in the English Public Records Office. In 1868 the first croquet all-comers' meeting was held at [[Moreton-in-Marsh]], [[Gloucestershire]] and in the same year the All England Croquet Club was formed at [[Wimbledon, London]]. 

In the book ''Queen of Games: The History of Croquet''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Smith | first=Nicky | title=Queen of Games: The History of Croquet | publisher=George Weidenfeld and Nicolson | year=1991 | isbn=0297811762}}&lt;/ref&gt; author Nicky Smith presents two theories of the origin of the modern game that took [[England]] by storm in the 1860s and then spread overseas. 

The first explanation is that the ancestral game was introduced to [[Great Britain|Britain]] from [[France]] during the reign of [[Charles II of England]], and was played under the name of [[paille maille]] or pall mall, derived ultimately from Latin words for &quot;[[ball]] and [[mallet]]&quot;. This was the explanation given in the ninth edition of ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]'', dated 1877. In his 1810 book entitled &quot;The sports and pastimes of the people of England,&quot; Joseph Strutt describes the way Pall Mall was played in England in the early 17th century:
&quot;Pale-maille is a game wherein a round box ball is struck with a mallet through a high arch of iron, which he that can do at the fewest blows, or at the number agreed upon, wins.' It is to be observed, that there are two of these arches, that is one at either end of the alley. The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second, and the walk in Saint James's Park, now called the Mall, received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall, where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=nSKFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=strutt+sport+goff#v=onepage&amp;q=croquet&amp;f=false |title=Sports and pastimes of the people of England |author=Joseph Strutt |date=|page=94  |work= |publisher=Google Books|accessdate=14 September 2010 |year=1810}},page 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotgrave, 1611&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EarlyCroquetSportsofPeopleofEnglandStrutt.jpg|thumbnail|right|400px|Early croquet game from ''The Sports and Pastimes of the people of England'', first published 1801. [[Hoop]], [[peg]] and two players with balls clearly shown.]]

Whilst the name Pall Mall and various games bearing this name may have been played elsewhere (France and Italy) the description above suggests that the croquet games were certainly popular in England as early as 1611.  Some early sources refer to Pall Mall being played over a large distance (as in golf), however an image in Joseph Strutt's 1801 book The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England clearly shows a croquet like game (balls on ground, hoop, bats and peg) being played over a ''short'' (garden sized) distance.  Interestingly this image describes the game as 'A curious ancient pastime', confirming that croquet games were not new in early nineteenth century England.

In [[Samuel Johnson]]'s 1828 dictionary his definition of &quot;Pall mall&quot; clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet: &quot;A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=z3kKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA519&amp;dq=pelmel#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=A dictionary of the English language |author=Samuel Johnson, John Walker, Robert S. Jameson |date= |work= |page=519 |publisher= |accessdate=14 September 2010 |year=1828}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that Pall Mall involved the croquet stroke which is the distinguishing characteristic of the modern game. 

The second theory is that the rules of the modern game of croquet arrived from [[Ireland]] during the 1850s, perhaps after being brought there from [[Brittany]] where a similar game was played on the beaches. Records show the similar game of &quot;crookey&quot; being played at [[Castlebellingham]] in 1834, which was introduced to [[Galway]] in 1835 and played on the bishop's palace garden, and in the same year to the genteel Dublin suburb of [[Dun Laoghaire]] (then Kingstown) where it was first spelt as &quot;croquet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irish Daily Mail]] 8 August 2009, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, no pre-1858 Irish document that describes the way game was played, in particular there is no reference to the distinctive croquet stroke.&lt;ref&gt;Prichard, DMC.  (1981) Littlehampton Book Services Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Eglington1.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A game of Croquet being played at [[Eglinton Country Park|Eglinton Castle]], North Ayrshire, in the early 1860s.]]
John Jaques, of the manufacturer [[Jaques of London]] that still supplies a significant share of croquet equipment used today, apparently claimed in a letter to [[Arthur Lillie]] in 1873 that he had himself seen the game played in Ireland and, &quot;I made the implements and published directions (such as they were) before Mr Spratt [mentioned above] introduced the subject to me&quot;. Whatever the truth of the matter, Jaques certainly played an important role in popularising the game, producing editions of the rules in 1857, 1860, and 1864.

Regardless when and by what route it reached [[England]] and the [[British Empire|British colonies]] in its recognizable form, croquet is, like pall mall, [[trucco]], [[jeu de mail]] and [[Kolven#History|kolven]], clearly a derivative of [[ground billiards]], which was popular in Western Europe back to at least the 14th century, with roots in [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shamos 1999&quot;&gt;{{Shamos 1999|p. 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clare&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Croquet became highly popular as a social pastime in [[England]] during the 1860s; by 1867, Jaques had printed 65,000 copies of his ''Laws and Regulations'' of the game. It quickly spread to other [[Anglophone]] countries, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], and the [[United States]]. No doubt one of the attractions was that the game could be played by both sexes; this also ensured a certain amount of adverse comment.

By the late 1870s, however, croquet had been eclipsed by another fashionable game, [[tennis]], and many of the newly-created croquet clubs, including the All-England club at [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], converted some or all of their lawns into [[tennis courts]]. There was a revival in the 1890s, but from then onwards, croquet was always a minority sport, with national individual participation amounting to a few thousand players. The [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] still has a croquet lawn, but has not hosted any significant tournaments. The English headquarters for the game is now in [[Cheltenham]].

===Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle croquet===
The earliest known reference to croquet in Scotland is the booklet called ''The Game of Croquet, its Laws and Regulations'' which was published in the middle 1860’s for the proprietor of Eglinton Castle, the [[Earl of Eglinton]]. On the page facing the title page is a picture of Eglinton Castle with a game of &quot;croquet&quot; in full swing.&lt;ref name=&quot;C&quot;&gt;[http://www.edinburghcroquetclub.com/intro.html Edinburgh Croquet Club] Retrieved : 2011-04-04&lt;/ref&gt; 

The croquet lawn existed on the northern terrace, between [[Eglinton Castle]] and the Lugton Water. The 13th Earl developed a variation on croquet named 'Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle Croquet', which had small bells on the eight hoops 'to ring the changes', two pegs, a double hoop with a bell and two tunnels for the ball to pass through. In 1865 the 'Rules of the Eglinton Castle and Cassiobury Croquet' was published by Edmund Routledge. Several incomplete sets of this form of croquet are known to exist and one complete set is still used for demonstration games in the West of Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;C&quot;/&gt; It is not known why the earl named the game thus.&lt;ref&gt;Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park - falconer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitive croquet ==
There are several variations of croquet currently played, differing in the scoring systems, order of shots, and layout (particularly in social games where play must be adapted to smaller-than-standard playing courts). Two forms of the game, association croquet and golf croquet, have rules that are agreed internationally and are played in many countries around the world. The United States has its own set of rules for domestic games. More unusual variations of the game include mondo croquet, [[extreme croquet]], and bicycle croquet (perhaps influenced by [[polo]]). [[Gateball]], played mainly in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Western Hemisphere|the Americas]], can also be regarded as a croquet variant.

As well as club-level games, there are regular world championships and international matches between croquet-playing countries. The sport has particularly strong followings in the UK, USA, New Zealand and Australia; every four years, these countries play the [[MacRobertson International Croquet Shield|MacRobertson Shield]] tournament. Many other countries also play. The current world rankings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcfcroquet.org/Rankings/teamranking.php |title=WCF World Team Rankings |author= |date=Updated April 8, 2010 |work= |publisher=World Croquet Federation |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; show England in top place for association croquet, followed by Australia and New Zealand sharing second place, with the United States in fourth position; the same four countries appear in the top six of the golf croquet league table, below Egypt in top position, and with South Africa at number five.

Croquet is popularly believed to be viciously competitive.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;So they left the subject and played croquet, which is a very good game for people who are annoyed at each other, giving many opportunities for venting rancour.&quot; —[[Rose Macaulay]], ''The Towers of Trebizond''&lt;/ref&gt; This may derive from the fact that (unlike in golf) players will often attempt to move their opponents' balls to unfavourable positions. However, purely negative play is rarely a winning strategy: successful players (in all versions other than golf croquet) will use all four balls to set up a break for themselves, rather than simply making the game as difficult as possible for their opponents. At championship-standard association croquet, players can often make all 26 points (13 for each ball) in two turns.

Croquet was an [[Croquet at the 1900 Summer Olympics|event at the 1900 Summer Olympics]] and [[roque]], a variation on croquet, an [[Roque at the 1904 Summer Olympics|event at the 1904 Summer Olympics]]. The World Series of Croquet is held annually.

==Association croquet==
[[File:Croquetplayers.jpg|thumb|Croquet being played at a club in the UK]]
Association croquet is the name of an advanced game of croquet, played at international level. It involves four balls teamed in pairs, with both balls going through every hoop for one pair to win. The game's distinguishing feature is the &quot;croquet&quot; shot: when certain balls hit other balls, extra shots are allowed. The six hoops are arranged three at each end of the court, with a centre peg.

In association croquet one side takes the black and blue balls, the other takes red and yellow. 
At each turn, the player can choose to play with either of his balls for that turn. 
At the start of a turn, the player plays a stroke. If the player either hits the ball through the correct hoop (&quot;runs&quot; the hoop), or hits another ball (a &quot;roquet&quot;), the turn continues. 
Following a roquet, the player picks up his or her own ball and puts it down next to the ball that it hit. The next shot is played with the two balls touching: this is the &quot;croquet stroke&quot; from which the game takes its name.
After the croquet stroke, the player plays a &quot;continuation&quot; stroke, during which the player may again attempt to make a roquet or run a hoop. Each of the other three balls may be roqueted once in a turn before a hoop is run, after which they become available to be roqueted again. 
The winner of the game is the team who completes the set circuit of six hoops (and then back again the other way), with both balls, and then strikes the centre peg (making a total of 13 points per ball = 26).

Good players may make &quot;breaks&quot; of several hoops in a single turn.  The best players may take a ball round a full circuit in one turn. &quot;Advanced play&quot; (a variant of association play for expert players) gives penalties to a player who runs certain hoops in the same turn; feats of skill such as triple peels or better, in which the partner ball (or occasionally an opponent ball) is caused to run a number of hoops in a turn by the striker's ball help avoid these penalties.

A handicap system ('bisques') provides less experienced players a chance of winning against more formidable opponents. Players of all ages and both sexes compete on level terms.

As of May 2009, the Association Croquet World Champion is [[Reg Bamford (croquet player)|Reg Bamford]] of [[South Africa]]. The World Championships are organised by the [[World Croquet Federation]] (WCF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcfcroquet.org/ |title=WFC News |author= |date=Updated September 9, 2010 |work= |publisher=World Croquet Federation |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and usually take place every 2 or 3 years. The next World Championship is to take place in April 2012 in [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcfcroquet.org/ |title=WFC News |author= |date=Updated September 9, 2010 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Britain]] team won the last [[MacRobertson International Croquet Shield]] tournament, which is the major international test tour trophy in association croquet. It is contested every 3 to 4 years between [[Australia]], [[Great Britain]], the [[United States]] and [[New Zealand]]. Historically the British have been the dominant force, winning 14 times out of the 20 times the event has been held. In individual competition, the UK is often divided by subnational country ([[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and so on.)

The world's top 10 association croquet players as at end of 2010 are [[Chris Clarke (croquet player)|Chris Clarke]] (England), [[Reg Bamford (croquet player)|Reg Bamford]] (South Africa), Paddy Chapman (New Zealand), [[Robert Fulford (croquet player)|Robert Fulford]] (England), Robert Fletcher (Australia), James Death (England), Ed Duckworth (England), David Maugham (England), Danny Huneycutt (USA) and Ben Rothman (USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://butedock.demon.co.uk/cgs/rank.php |title=Croquet Grading System |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Demon.co.uk |accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most sports, men and women compete and are ranked together. Three women have won the British Open Championship: [[Lily Gower]] in 1905, Dorothy Steel in 1925, 1933, 1935 and 1936, and Hope Rotherham in 1960. While male players are in the majority at club level in the UK, the opposite is the case in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. The highest-ranked female player in the world as of January 2011 is Jenny Clarke of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.croquetrecords.com/rank/currentworld.htm |title=Current World Rankings (19 December 2010) |author= |date= |work=Rankings |publisher=Croquetrecords.com |accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governing body in England is The [[Croquet Association]], which has been the driving force of the development of the game. The rules and tournament regulations are now maintained by the International Laws Committee, established by the croquet associations of England and Wales (CA), Australia (ACA), New Zealand (CNZ) and the United States (USCA).

==Golf croquet==
In '''golf croquet''' a hoop is won by the first ball to go through each hoop. Unlike Association Croquet, there are no additional turns for hitting other balls. 

Each player takes a stroke in turn, each trying to hit a ball through the same hoop. The sequence of play is blue, red, black, yellow. Blue and black balls play against red and yellow. When a hoop is won, the sequence of play continues as before. The winner of the game is the player/team who wins the most hoops. 

Golf croquet is the fastest-growing version of the game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.croquet.org.uk/ca/survey/2007/CA_Survey_Report-2007.pdf |title=A Survey of Croquet Players |author=Kevin Carter |year=2007 |work=Profundus Consulting |publisher= |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; owing largely to its simplicity and competitiveness. Egyptian players dominate the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.croquet.org.uk/news/newsdb.asp?NewsID=2766 |title=News |author= |date=21 July 2008 |work=Egypt v Rest of World GC Event |publisher=2000-2010 The Croquet Association  |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golf croquet is easier to learn and play, but requires strategic skills and accurate play. In comparison with association croquet, play is faster and balls are more likely to be lifted off the ground, as seen in [http://golfcroquet.blip.tv/#1106765 this video footage].

As of 2008, the Golf Croquet World Champion is Ahmed Nasr ([[Egypt]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcfcroquet.org/Tournaments/gcwc2008.html |title=WCF Laidlaw World Golf Croquet Championship |author= |date=Updated 9 September 2010 |work=The WCF Laidlaw World Golf Croquet Championship was held in Cape Town, South Africa 8–16 March 2008 |publisher=World Croquet Federation |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, the Women's Golf Croquet World Champion is Alix Verge ([[Australia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcfcroquet.org/Tournaments/3rd-WCF-Womens-World-Golf-Croquet-Championship_2009.html |title=2009 World Women's Golf Croquet Championship for the &quot;Clarke Trophy&quot; 21–28 November 2009 |author= |date=Updated March 30, 2010 |work= |publisher=World Croquet Federation |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American six-wicket croquet==
&lt;!--[[File:TwilightCroquet4034.JPG|thumb|200px|An American game of croquet at twilight. ]]--&gt;
The American rules version of croquet &amp;ndash; another six-wicket game &amp;ndash; is the dominant version of the game in the United States and is also widely played in [[Canada]]. It is [[Sports governing body|governed]] by the [[United States Croquet Association]]. Its genesis is mostly in association croquet, but it differs in a number of important ways that reflect the home-grown traditions of American &quot;backyard&quot; croquet.

Two of the most notable differences are that the balls are always played in the same sequence (blue, red, black, yellow) throughout the game, and that a ball's &quot;deadness&quot; on other balls is carried over from turn to turn until the ball has been &quot;cleared&quot; by scoring its next hoop. Tactics are simplified on the one hand by the strict sequence of play, and complicated on the other hand by the continuation of deadness. A further difference is the more restrictive boundary-line rules of American croquet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ian Plummer&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordcroquet.com/laws/usca/index.asp |title=Association vs US (6-wicket) Rules Croquet |author=Ian Plummer |date=Updated 1 January 2011 |work= |publisher=Oxford Croquet  |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the American game, roqueting a ball out of bounds or running a hoop out of bounds causes the turn to end, and balls that go out of bounds are replaced only nine inches from the boundary rather than a yard as in association croquet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ian Plummer&quot;/&gt; &quot;Attacking&quot; balls on the boundary line to bring them into play is thus far more challenging.

==Glossary of croquet terms==
* '''Backward ball''': The ball of a side that has scored fewer hoops (compare with 'forward ball').&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkins&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Complete Croquet: A Guide to Skills, Tactics, and Strategy|author=James Hawkins|publisher=Crowood Press|isbn=9781847971685|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ball-in-hand''': A ball that the striker can pick up to change its position, for example:
:# any ball when it leaves the court has to be replaced on the yard-line
:# the striker’s ball after making a roquet must be placed in contact with the roqueted ball
:# the striker’s ball when the striker is entitled to a lift.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot;&gt;''[http://www.croquet.org.uk/association/6th/index.html Laws of Association Croquet]'', 6th Edition, amended 2008, Croquet Association.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ball in play''': A ball after it has been played into the game, which is not a ball in hand or pegged out.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Baulk''': An imaginary line on which a ball is placed for its first shot in the game, or when taking a lift. The A-baulk coincides with the western half of the yard line along the south boundary; the B-baulk occupies the eastern half of the north boundary yard line.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Bisque, half-bisque''' A bisque is a free turn in a handicap match. A half-bisque is a restricted handicap turn in which no point may be scored.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;

* '''Continuation stroke''': Either the bonus stroke played after running a hoop in order or the second bonus stroke played after making a roquet.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Croquet stroke''': A stroke taken after making a roquet, in which the striker's ball and the roqueted ball are placed together in contact.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Double-banking''': Playing two games on one croquet lawn at once. One game uses the secondary colours: green and brown versus pink and white.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Double tap''': A fault in which the mallet makes more than one audible sound when it strikes the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Forward ball''': The ball of a side that has scored more hoops (compare with 'backward ball').&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkins&quot;/&gt;
* '''Hoop''': Metal U-shaped gate pushed into ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot;/&gt; (Also called a '''wicket''' in the US).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
* '''Leave''': The position of the balls after a successful break, in which the striker is able to leave the balls placed so as to make life as difficult as possible for the opponent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkins&quot;/&gt;
* '''Lift''': A turn in which the player is entitled to remove the ball from its current position and play instead from either baulk line. A lift is permitted when a ball has been placed by the opponent in a position where it is wired from all other balls, and also in advanced play when the opponent has completed a break that includes hoops 1-back or 4-back.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Object ball''': A ball which is going to be rushed.
* '''Peg out''': To cause a rover ball to strike the peg and conclude its active involvement in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Peel''': To send a ball other than the striker's ball through its target hoop.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Primary colours''' or '''first colours''': The main croquet ball colours used which are blue, red, black and yellow (in order of play). Blue and black, and red and yellow, are played by the same player or pair.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Push''': A fault when the mallet pushes the striker's ball, rather than making a clean strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Roquet''': (Second syllable rhymes with &quot;play&quot;.) When the striker’s ball hits a ball that he is entitled to then take a croquet shot with. At the start of a turn, the striker is entitled to roquet all the other three balls once. Once the striker's ball goes through its target hoop, it is again entitled to roquet the other balls once.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Rover ball''': A ball that has run all 12 hoops and can be pegged out.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Rover hoop''': The last hoop, indicated by a red top bar. The first hoop has a blue top.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Run a hoop''': To send the striker’s ball through a hoop. If the hoop is the hoop in order for the striker’s ball, the striker earns a bonus stroke.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Rush''': A roquet when the roqueted ball is sent to a specific position on the court, such as the next hoop for the striker’s ball or close to a ball that the striker wishes to roquet next.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkins&quot;/&gt;
* '''Scatter shot''': A continuation stroke used to hit a ball which may not be roqueted in order to send it to a less dangerous position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkins&quot;/&gt;
* '''Secondary colours''' or '''second colours'''; also known as '''alternate colours'''&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot;/&gt;: The colours of the balls used in the second game played on the same court in double-banking: green, pink, brown and white (in order of play). Green and brown versus pink and white, are played by the same player or pair.&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot; /&gt;
* '''Sextuple peel''' ('''SXP'''): To peel the partner ball through its last six hoops in the course of a single turn. Very few players have achieved this feat, but it is being seen increasingly at championship level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkins&quot;/&gt;
* '''Tice''': A ball sent to a location that will entice an opponent to shoot at it but miss.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkins&quot;/&gt;
* '''Triple peel''' ('''TP'''): To send a ball other than the striker’s ball through its last three hoops, and then peg it out. See also [[Triple Peel on Opponent]] (TPO). The significance of this manoevre is that in advanced play, making a break that includes the tenth hoop (called 4-back) is penalized by granting the opponent a lift (entitling him to take the next shot from either baulk line). Therefore many breaks stop voluntarily with three hoops and the peg still to run.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkins&quot;/&gt;
* '''Wired''': When a hoop or the peg impedes the path of a striker's ball, or the swing of the mallet. A player will often endeavour to finish a turn with the opponent's balls wired from each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkins&quot;/&gt;
* '''Yard line''': An imaginary line one yard from the boundary. Balls that go off the boundary are generally replaced on the yard line (but if this happens on a croquet stroke, the turn ends).&lt;ref name=&quot;laws&quot;/&gt;

==Art and literature==
[[File:Edouard Manet 012.jpg|thumb|''The Croquet Game'', [[Édouard Manet]], 1873.]]
[[Image:Louise Abbéma - A Game of Croquet.jpg|thumb|right|[[Louise Abbéma]], ''A Game of Croquet'' ([[Trouville]], 1872), private collection]]
The way croquet is depicted in paintings and books says much about popular perceptions of the game, though little about the reality of modern play.

*[[Winslow Homer]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Louise Abbéma]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] all have paintings titled ''The Croquet Game.''
*[[Norman Rockwell]] often depicted the game, including in his painting ''Croquet.''
*A favorite subject of [[Edward Gorey]], a croquet reference often appeared in the first illustration of his books. ''[[Edward Gorey#Books|The Epiplectic Bicycle]]'' opens with two illustrations of the main characters playing with croquet mallets.
*[[H. G. Wells]] wrote ''The Croquet Player,'' which uses croquet as a metaphor for the way in which man confronts the very problem of his own existence.
*[[Lewis Carroll]] featured a surreal version of the game in the popular children's novel ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''; a hedgehog was used as the ball, a flamingo the mallet, and playing cards as the wickets.
*In the &quot;[[Thursday Next]]&quot; series of novels, notably ''[[Something Rotten]]'', [[Jasper Fforde]] depicts an alternative world in which croquet is a brutal mass spectator sport.
*In the 1988 film ''[[Heathers]]'', [[Winona Ryder]] and her [[friends]] are depicted as playing croquet.

==Politics==
On 25 May 2006, the then [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Prescott]] was photographed by ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' playing croquet at his official residence, [[Dorneywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14049-2206420,00.html|title=Prescott Quits Country House to Save Skin|last=Webster|first=Philip|date=2006-06-01|work=[[The Times]]|location=[[London]]|publisher=News International|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following shortly after a sex scandal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4945170.stm|title=Prescott Admits Affair with Aide|date=28 April 2006|accessdate=2009-05-04 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had forced Prescott to resign his ministerial responsibilities while retaining his salary and privileges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-2167472,00.html|title=Prescott loses his dream home: the mega-department|last=Knight|first=Sam|date=2006-05-05|publisher=Times|accessdate=2009-05-04 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the incident was portrayed as evidence that Prescott had little real responsibility for running the country during the absence of the [[Prime Minister]]. Shortly afterwards, Prescott announced that he would no longer make use of the Dorneywood residence.

It was also reported that the incident led to a 300% increase in sales of croquet equipment at [[Asda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-388666/Prescott-helps-croquet-sets-sales-soar.html|title=Prescott helps croquet sets sales soar|date=2006-06-01|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the TV [[Five (channel)|Five]] announced that they would be running a series featuring croquet matches played at country houses pitting &quot;rich&quot; against &quot;poor&quot; players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/media/story/0,,1789053,00.html

'''Curling''' is a sport in which players slide stones across a sheet of ice towards a target area. It is related to [[bowls]], [[Boules|boule]] and [[shuffleboard]].

Two teams, each of four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished [[granite]] stones, also called &quot;rocks&quot;, across the ice ''curling sheet'' towards the ''house'', a circular target marked on the ice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/vancouver/curling/news?slug=dw-curling021810&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns Wetzel, Dan. (February 19, 2010) ''Don’t take curling for granite'' Yahoo! Sports.]&lt;/ref&gt; Each team has eight stones. The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a ''game'', points being scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each ''end'', which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones. A game may consist of ten or eight ends.

The curler can induce a curved path by causing the stone to slowly turn as it slides, and the path of the rock may be further influenced by two sweepers with brooms who accompany it as it slides down the sheet, using the brooms to alter the state of the ice in front of the stone. A great deal of strategy and teamwork goes into choosing the ideal path and placement for each situation, and the skills of the curlers determine how close to the desired result the stone will achieve. This gives the game its nickname of &quot;Chess On Ice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2009/01/28/pages/5296/index.xml |title=‘Chess on ice’ |work=Princeton Allumni Weekly |date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curlnews.blogspot.com/2007/06/chess-on-ice.html |title=Chess on ice |work=The Curling News |date=2007-06-22 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and history ==

Curling is thought to have been invented in medieval Scotland, with the first written reference to a contest using stones on ice coming from the records of [[Paisley Abbey]], [[Renfrewshire]], in February 1541. Two paintings (both dated 1565) by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] depict [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[peasant]]s curling—Scotland and the [[Low Countries]] had strong trading and cultural links during this period, which is also evident in the [[history of golf]].

Evidence that curling existed in Scotland in the early 16th century includes a curling stone inscribed with the date 1511 (uncovered along with another bearing the date 1551) when an old pond was drained at Dunblane, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/002022.asp |title=Wooden Curling Stone |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |date=2006-02-23 |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kilsyth]] Curling Club claims to be the first club in the world, having been formally constituted in 1716; it is still in existence today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paperclip.org.uk/kilsythweb/Communityresources/Curlinghistory.htm Kilsyth Curling History]&lt;/ref&gt; Kilsyth also claims the oldest purpose-built curling pond in the world at [[Colzium]], in the form of a low dam creating a shallow pool some 100 &amp;times; 250 metres in size, though this is now very seldom in condition for curling because of warmer winters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The word ''curling'' first appears in print in 1620 in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], in the [[preface]] and the verses of a poem by [[Henry Adamson]]. The game was (and still is, in Scotland and Scottish-settled regions like southern New Zealand) also known as &quot;the roaring game&quot; because of the sound the stones make while traveling over the ''pebble'' (droplets of water applied to the playing surface). The verbal noun ''curling'' is formed from the [[Scots language|Scots]] (and English) verb ''curl'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?query=curl&amp;sset=1&amp;fset=20&amp;printset=20&amp;searchtype=full&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=both SND]&lt;/ref&gt; which describes the motion of the stone.

In the early history of curling, the playing stones (or rocks) were simply flat-bottomed river stones that were sometimes notched or shaped; the thrower, unlike those of today, had little control over the stone, and relied more on luck than on skill and strategy.

It is recorded that in [[Darvel]], [[East Ayrshire]], the weavers relaxed by playing curling matches. The stones they used were the heavy stone weights from the weavers' &quot;warp beams,&quot; fitted with a detachable handle for the purpose. Many a wife would keep her husband's brass curling stone handle on the mantelpiece, brightly polished until the next time it was needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLeod8&quot;&gt;Nate Baker (Editor), ''The Book of Old Darvel and Some of its Famous Sons''. Pub. Walker &amp; Connell, Darvel. P. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoor curling was very popular in Scotland between the 16th and 19th centuries, as the climates provided good ice conditions every winter. Scotland is home to the international governing body for curling, the [[World Curling Federation]], Perth, which originated as a committee of the [[Royal Caledonian Curling Club]], the mother club of curling.

Today, the game is most firmly established in [[Sports in Canada|Canada]], having been taken there by [[Scottish emigrants]]. The Royal Montreal Curling Club, the oldest established sports club still active in [[North America]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalmontrealcurling.ca/node/ &quot;The Royal Montreal Curling Club&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; was established in 1807. The first curling club in the [[United States]] began in 1830, and the game was introduced to [[Switzerland]] and [[Sweden]] before the end of the 19th century, also by Scots. Today, curling is played all over [[Europe]] and has spread to [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[China]], and [[Korea]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The first world curling championship in the sport was limited to men and was known as the &quot;[[Scotch Cup]]&quot;, held in [[Falkirk]] and [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], in 1959. The first world title was won by the [[Canada|Canadian]] team from [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], skipped by [[Ernie Richardson]]. (The skip is the team member who calls the shots; see below.)

The first curling club in the United States was organized in 1830 only 30 miles from Detroit, at [[Orchard Lake, Michigan]]. Called the Orchard Lake Curling Club, the club used hickory block &quot;stones&quot;. The Detroit Curling Club was started in 1840 when Michigan only had a population of 212,000 and had only been in the Union for three years. About this time, an organization called the &quot;Thistle Club&quot; was founded and, curling being a winter sport, was played when the ice was suitable on the Detroit River at the foot of Joseph Campau; on the bay; and at the old Recreation Park. These clubs became the Granite Club, and in 1885, the present [[Detroit Curling Club]] was organized.

=== Olympic curling ===
Curling has been an official sport in the [[Winter Olympic Games]] since the [[1998 Winter Olympics]]. In February 2002, the [[International Olympic Committee]] retroactively decided that the curling competition from the [[1924 Winter Olympics]] (originally called ''Semaine des Sports d'Hiver'', or International Winter Sports Week) would be considered official Olympic events and no longer be considered demonstration events. Thus, the [[Curling at the 1924 Winter Olympics#Medals|first Olympic medals in curling]], which at the time was played outside, were awarded for the 1924 Winter Games, with the gold medal won by Great Britain and Ireland, two silver medals by Sweden, and the bronze by France. A demonstration tournament was also held during the [[1932 Winter Olympic Games]] between four teams from [[Canada]] and four teams from the [[United States]], with Canada winning 12 games to 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= III Winter Olympic Games, Lake Placid 1932, Official Report |editor-first=George M. |year=1932 |pages=255–258 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1932/1932w.pdf |accessdate=2008-08-14 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20910F8355B13738DDDAF0894DA405B828FF1D3 |title=CANADIANS WIN AT CURLING.; Beat United States, 12 Games to 3, in Exhibition Series |work=The New York Times |date=1932-02-06|pages=SPORTS, Page 20 |accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment ==
[[File:curlingsheet.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The playing area in curling is shown here. Stones must land between the ''hog line'' (bottom of photo) and the ''back line'' (behind the rings) and may not contact boards or out lines (on the sides) at any time during travel.]]

=== The curling sheet ===
The playing surface or ''curling sheet'' is defined by the [[World Curling Federation]] Rules of Curling.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldcurlingrules&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcurling.org/rules-and-regulations |title=The Rules of Curling and Rules of Competition |publisher=World Curling Federation |date=2008-06 |accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sheet is an area of ice, carefully prepared to be as flat and level as possible, {{convert|146|to|150|ft|m}} in length by {{convert|14.5|to|16.5|ft|m}} in width.

A target, the ''house'', is marked at each end of the sheet. The house consists of three concentric rings formed by painting or laying coloured [[vinyl]] sheet under the ice and are usually distinguished by colour. These rings are defined by their diameters as the four-foot, eight-foot and 12-foot rings. The rings are merely a visual aid for aiming and judging which stone is closer to the centre; they do not affect scoring but a stone must at least touch the outer ring or it does not score (see Scoring below).

Each house is centred on the intersection of the ''centre line'', drawn lengthwise down the centre of the sheet and one of the ''tee lines'', drawn {{convert|16|ft|m}} from, and parallel to, each backboard. These lines divide the houses into quarters.

The centre of each house, at the intersection of the centre line and the tee line, is known as the ''button''. Two ''hog lines'', are drawn {{convert|37|ft|m}} from, and parallel to, each backboard.

The ''hacks'' are fixed 12 feet behind each button; a hack gives the thrower something to push against when making the throw. On indoor rinks, there are usually two fixed hacks, rubber-lined holes, one on each side of the centre line, with the inside edge no more than {{convert|3|in|mm}} from the centre line and the front edge on the hack line. A single moveable hack may also be used.
[[File:Curlingsheet flip.svg|thumb|center|950px|&lt;center&gt;A curling sheet, with dimensions &amp;ndash; '''CL:'''&amp;nbsp;Centreline • '''HOL:'''&amp;nbsp;Hogline • '''TL:'''&amp;nbsp;Teeline •  '''BL:'''&amp;nbsp;Backline  •  '''HA:'''&amp;nbsp;Hackline with Hacks  •  '''FGZ:'''&amp;nbsp;Free Guard Zone&lt;/center&gt;]]

The ice may be natural but is usually frozen by a refrigeration plant pumping a brine solution through numerous pipes fixed lengthwise at the bottom of a shallow pan of water. Most curling clubs have an ice maker, whose main job is to care for the ice. At the major curling championships, ice maintenance is extremely important. Large events, such as the [[Tim Hortons Brier|Brier]] or other national championships, are typically held in an arena that presents a challenge to the ice maker, who must constantly monitor and adjust the ice and air temperatures as well as air humidity levels to ensure a consistent playing surface. It is common for each sheet of ice to have multiple sensors embedded in order to monitor surface temperature, as well as probes set up in the seating area (to monitor humidity) and in the compressor room (to monitor brine supply and return temperatures).The surface of the ice is maintained at a temperature of around {{convert|23|°F|°C}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;branch&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/sports/17curling.html?ref=sports Branch, John. &quot;Curlers Are Finicky When It Comes to Their Olympic Ice&quot;, ''The New York Times'', Monday, August 17, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key part of the preparation of the playing surface is the spraying of water droplets onto the ice, which form ''pebble'' on freezing. As the stone moves over the pebble, any rotation of the stone causes it to ''curl'' to the inside or outside; the amount of curl can change during a game as the pebble wears.

=== Curling stone ===
[[File:curlingrock.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The curling ''stone'' or ''rock'' is made of [[granite]]]]
[[File:Curlingstoneold.JPG|right|thumb|200px|An old-style curling stone]]

The curling stone, (also sometimes ''rock'', North America) as defined by the [[World Curling Federation]] is a thick stone disc weighing between {{convert|38|and|44|lb|kg}} with a handle attached to the top.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldcurlingrules&quot;/&gt; The maximum allowable circumference is {{convert|36|in|mm}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldcurlingrules&quot; /&gt; The minimum height is {{convert|4.5|in|mm}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldcurlingrules&quot; /&gt; The handle is attached by a bolt running vertically through a hole in the centre of the stone. The handle allows the stone to be gripped and rotated upon release; on properly prepared ice, the stone's path will bend (''curl'') in the direction the front edge of the stone is turning, especially as the stone slows. The handles are colored to identify the stones by team. Two popular colors in major tournaments are red and yellow. The only part of the stone in contact with the ice is the ''running surface'', a narrow, flat annulus or ring, {{convert|0.25|to|0.50|in|mm}} wide and about {{convert|5|in|mm}} in diameter; the sides of the stone bulge convex down to the ring and the inside of the ring is hollowed concave to clear the ice.

Traditionally, curling stones were made from two specific types of [[granite]] called &quot;Blue Hone&quot; and &quot;Ailsa Craig Common Green&quot;, found on [[Ailsa Craig]], an island off the [[Ayrshire]] coast in [[Scotland]]. Blue Hone has very low water absorption, which prevents the action of freezing and melting water from eroding the stone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anchoragecurling.com/evolution.htm Anchorage Curling Club – About Curling/Stones&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ailsa Craig Common Green granite is a lesser quality granite than Blue Hone. In the past, most curling stones were made from Blue Hone; however, the island is now a wildlife reserve and the quarry has closed. The second location where granite comes from to manufacture curling stones from is in Northern Wales. This granite is called &quot;Trefor&quot; and comes in shades of blue/gray and red/brown. The quarry in Wales that supplies the granite to its exclusive curling stone manufacturing company in Canada, Canada Curling Stone Co., is a full and active quarry and it is not anticipated to ever run out of this granite for making curling stones. Canada Curling Stone Co. has been manufacturing curling stones since 1992. The cost of new Trefor granite curling stones is about $600 CAD a stone.

Kays of Scotland has been making curling stones since 1851 and has the exclusive rights to Ailsa Craig granite, granted by the [[Marquess of Ailsa]], whose family has owned the island since 1560. The last &quot;harvest&quot; of Ailsa Craig granite by Kays took place in 2002. Kays have said that they harvested 1,500 tons, sufficient to fill anticipated orders through at least 2020. Kays has been the exclusive manufacturer of curling stones for all three Olympics where curling has been a medal sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaysofscotland.co.uk/about.cfm Kays of Scotland: About us]&lt;/ref&gt;

In competition, an electronic handle known as the ''eye on the hog'' may be fitted to detect hog line violations, the game's most frequent cause of controversy. This electronically detects whether the thrower's hand is in contact with the handle as it passes the hog line and indicates a violation by lights at the base of the handle. The ''eye on the hog'' eliminates human error and the need for hog line officials. It is mandatory in high-level national and international competition but its cost, around US$650 each, currently puts it beyond the reach of most social curling.

[[File:Curling broom.png|thumb|left|250px|Curling broom]]

=== Curling broom ===
The ''curling broom'', or ''brush'', is used to sweep the ice surface in the path of the stone, (see [[#Sweeping|&quot;sweeping&quot;]]), and is also often used as a balancing aid during delivery of the stone.

In earlier days, brooms were made of corn strands and were similar to household brooms. Brushes were used primarily by elderly curlers as a substitute for corn brooms. Today, brushes have replaced traditional corn brooms at every level of curling, but are universally referred to as brooms. Curling brushes may have fabric, hog hair, or horsehair heads. Modern curling broomsticks are usually hollow tubes made of [[fiberglass]] or [[carbon fiber]] instead of a solid length of wooden [[dowel]]. These hollow tube handles are lighter and stronger than wooden handles, allowing faster sweeping and also enabling more downward force to be applied to the broom head with reduced shaft flex.

=== Shoes ===
[[File:curlingshoes.jpg|align=right|thumb|225px|Curling shoes, showing a slider sole]]

Curling shoes are similar to ordinary athletic shoes except that they have dissimilar soles; the ''slider shoe'' is designed for the off foot (or sliding foot) and the ''non-sliding shoe'' for the hack foot:

'''''The slider shoe''''' is designed to slide and typically has a [[PTFE|Teflon]] sole. It is worn by the thrower during delivery from the hack and by sweepers or the skip to glide down the ice when sweeping or otherwise traveling down the sheet quickly. [[Stainless steel]] was once common for slider soles, and &quot;red brick&quot; sliders with lateral blocks of [[PVC]] on the sole are also available. When not throwing, sliding shoes can be temporarily rendered non-slippery by using a slip-on gripper. Ordinary athletic shoes may be converted to sliders by using a step-on or slip-on Teflon slider or by applying electrical or gaffer tape directly to the sole or over a piece of cardboard. This arrangement often suits casual or beginning players.

'''''The non-sliding shoe''','' or ''hack foot shoe,'' is worn by the thrower on the hack foot during delivery and is designed to grip. It may have a normal athletic shoe sole or a special layer of rubbery material applied to the sole of a thickness to match the sliding shoe. The toe of the hack foot shoe may also have a rubberised coating on the top surface or a flap that hangs over the toe to reduce wear on the top of the shoe as it drags on the ice behind the thrower.

=== Other equipment ===
Other types of equipment include:
:*Curling pants, made to be stretchy to accommodate the curling delivery.
:*A [[stopwatch]] to time the stones while sweeping to get a feel of the speed of the stone. Stopwatches can be attached either to clothing or the broom itself.
:*Curling gloves and mittens, to keep the hands warm and improve grip on the broom.{{clr}}

== Gameplay ==
International competitive games are ten ends, so most of the national championships that send a representative to the World Championships or Olympics also play ten ends. However, there is a movement on the [[World Curling Tour]] to make the games only eight ends.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Most tournaments on that tour are like the vast majority of recreation games, and are eight ends. An end consists of each player from both teams throwing two stones down the sheet with the players on each side alternating shots, for a total of 16 stones. A game may be conceded if considered unwinnable. If the teams are tied play continues for as many ends as may be required to break the tie. The winner is the team with the highest score after all ends have been completed (see [[#Scoring|Scoring]] below).

[[File:Curling Canada Torino 2006.jpg|thumb|right|300px|At the [[2006 Winter Olympic Games]] a curler from Team Canada delivers a stone, while his teammates look on, ready to begin sweeping. The curler uses his broom to help keep his balance during delivery.]]

In international competition, each side is given 73 minutes to complete all of its throws. Each team is also allowed two 60-second timeouts per 10-end game. If extra ends are required, each team is allowed 10 minutes of playing time to complete its throws and one added 60-second timeout for each extra end.

=== Delivery ===
The process of sliding a stone down the sheet is known as the ''delivery''.

The ''skip'' will usually determine the required ''weight'', ''turn'' and ''line'' of the stone. These will be influenced by the tactics at this point in the game, which may involve taking-out, blocking or tapping another stone.
* The '''''weight''''' of the stone is its velocity, which depends on the leg drive of the delivery rather than the arm.
* The '''''turn''''' is the rotation of the stone, which gives it a curved trajectory.
* The '''''line''''' is the direction of the throw ignoring the effect of the ''turn''.

The skip may communicate the ''weight'', ''turn'', ''line'' and other tactics by calling or tapping a broom on the ice. In the case of a takeout, guard or a tap, the skip will indicate the stones involved.

Before delivery, the running surface of the stone is wiped clean and the path across the ice swept with the broom if necessary because any dirt on the bottom of a stone or in its path can alter the trajectory and ruin the shot. This is called a ''pick up'' or ''pick''.
[[File:hack.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Players must push out of the ''hack'' to deliver their stones.]]

The thrower throws from the ''hack''. Another player, usually the skip, is stationed behind the ''button'' to determine the tactics, ''weight'', ''turn'' and ''line'' and the other two may sweep in front of the stone to influence the trajectory (see [[#Sweeping|Sweeping]], below). When the skip throws, the ''third'' takes his role.

The thrower's ''gripper'' shoe (with the non-slippery sole) is positioned against one of the hacks; for a right-handed curler the right foot is placed against the left hack and vice-versa for a left-hander. The thrower, now ''in the hack'', lines the body up with shoulders square to the skip's broom at the far end for ''line''.

The stone is placed in front of the foot now in the hack. Rising slightly from the hack the thrower pulls the stone back to the toe (some older curlers may actually raise the stone in this backward movement) then lunges smoothly out from the hack pushing the stone ahead while the slider foot is moved in front of the gripper foot, which trails behind. The thrust from this lunge determines the ''weight'' and hence the distance the stone will travel. While not compulsory, most curlers deliver the stone while sliding out from the hack. Balance may be assisted by a broom held in the free hand with the back of the broom down so that it slides.

The stone is released as the thrower's momentum wanes, or the hog line is approached, at which point the ''turn'' is imparted by a slight clockwise or anti-clockwise twist of the handle from around the two or ten o'clock position to the 12 o'clock on release. A typical rate of turn is about 2½ rotations before coming to a rest.

The stone must be released before its front edge crosses the near hog line and it must clear the far hog line or else be removed from play (''hogged''); an exception is made if a stone fails to come to rest beyond the far hog line after rebounding from a stone in play just past the hog line. The release rule is rarely enforced in club play unless abuse is suspected, however in major tournaments it is strictly enforced; the &quot;eye on the hog&quot; sensor in the stone will indicate whether the stone has been legally thrown or not. If the lights on the stone turn red the stone will be immediately pulled from play instead of waiting for the stone to come to rest.

[[File:Olympic Curling, Vancouver 2010 crop sweeping.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The front end of Team Sweden has been joined by the skip in sweeping a stone into the house at the [[2010 Winter Olympic Games]] in [[Vancouver]]]]

=== Sweeping ===
After the stone is delivered its trajectory is still influenced by the two sweepers under instruction from the skip. Sweeping is done for two reasons: to reduce friction underneath the stone, and to decrease the amount of curl. The stones curl more as they slow down, so sweeping early in travel tends to increase distance as well as straighten the path, and sweeping after sideways motion is established can increase the sideways distance. When sweeping, pressure and speed of the brush head are key in slightly increasing the layer of moisture that builds up under the stone.

One of the basic strategy aspects of curling is knowing when to sweep. When the ice in front of the stone is swept, a stone will usually travel both farther and straighter. In some situations, one of the two alterations in path is not desirable. For example, a stone may have too much weight, but require sweeping to prevent curling into a guard. The team must decide which is better: getting by the guard but traveling too far, or hitting the guard.

Much of the yelling that goes on during a curling game is the skip calling the ''line'' of the shot and the sweepers calling the ''weight''. The skip evaluates the path of the stone and calls to the sweepers to sweep as necessary to maintain the intended track. The sweepers themselves are responsible for judging the weight of the stone, ensuring the length of travel is correct and communicating the weight of the stone back to the skip. Some teams use stopwatch timing, from back line to the nearest hog line as a sweeping aid. Many teams use the ''Number System'' to communicate in which of 10 playable zones it is estimated the stone will stop.

Usually, the two sweepers will be on opposite sides of the stone’s path, although depending on which side the sweepers’ strengths lie this may not always be the case. Speed and pressure are vital to sweeping. In gripping the broom, one hand should be one third of the way from the top (non-brush end) of the handle while the other hand should be one third of the way from the head of the broom. The angle of the broom to the ice should be so that the most force possible can be exerted on the ice. The precise amount of pressure may vary from relatively light brushing &quot;just cleaning&quot; (to ensure debris will not alter the stone’s path) to maximum-pressure scrubbing.

Sweeping is allowed anywhere on the ice up to the ''tee line'', as long as it is only for one’s own team stones. Once the leading edge of a team stone crosses the tee line only one player may sweep it. Additionally, when a stone crosses the tee line, one player from the other team is allowed to sweep it. This is the only case that a stone may be swept by an opposing team member. In international rules, this player must be the skip; or if the skip is throwing, then the sweeping player must be the third.

==='Burning' a stone===
Occasionally, players may accidentally touch a stone with their broom or a body part. This is often referred to as &quot;burning&quot; a stone. Players touching a stone in such a manner are expected to call their own infraction (see [[#Good sportsmanship|Good sportsmanship]]). Touching a stationary stone when no stones are in play (there is no delivery in progress) is never an infraction and is a common way to indicate where a stone that is to be taken out should be struck.

When a stone is touched when stones are in play, the remedies vary&lt;ref name=&quot;worldcurlingrules&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;canadiancurlingrules&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.curling.ca/contentImages/File/2007-2008%20General%20Rules%20of%20Play.pdf |title=Rules of Curling for General Play |publisher=Canadian Curling Association |date=2007-09 |accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; between placing the rocks as they end up after the touch, replacing the rocks as they would have been if no rock were touched, or removal of the touched rock from play. The rules generally dictate that the resulting outcome should be the one that places the touching team at the greatest possible disadvantage.

[[File:Curling pictogram lip.png|thumb|right|150px|Curling pictogram]]

=== Types of shots ===
Many different types of shots are used to carefully place stones for strategic or tactical reasons; they fall into three fundamental categories as follows:

'''''Guards''''' are thrown in front of the house in the ''free guard zone'', usually to protect the ''shot-rock'' (the stone closest to the button at the time) or to make the opposing team's shot difficult. Guard shots include the ''centre-guard'', on the centreline and the''corner-guards'' to the left or right sides of the centre line. See ''Free Guard Zone'' below.

'''''Draws''''' are thrown only to reach the house. Draw shots include ''raise'' and ''angle-raise'', ''come-around'', and ''freeze'' shots.

'''''Takeouts''''' are intended to remove stones from play and include the ''peel'', ''hit-and-roll'' and ''double'' shots.

For a more complete listing, look at the complete list [[Glossary of curling terms]].

=== Free guard zone ===
Until four stones have been played (two from each side), stones in the ''free guard zone'' (those stones left in the area between the hog and tee lines, excluding the house) may not be removed by an opponent's stone. These are known as ''guard rocks''. If the guard rocks are removed, they are replaced to where they were before the shot was thrown, and the opponent's stone is removed from play and cannot be replayed. This rule is known as the ''four-rock rule'' or the ''free guard zone rule'' (for a while in Canada, a &quot;three-rock rule&quot; was in place, but that rule has been replaced by the four-rock rule).

Originally, the Modified Moncton Rule was developed from a suggestion made by [[Russ Howard]] for a cashspiel (with the richest prize ever awarded at the time in a tournament) in [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]], in 1991. &quot;Howard's Rule&quot; (also known as the Moncton Rule), used for the tournament and based on a practice drill his team used, had the first four rocks in play unable to be removed no matter where they were at any time during the end. This method of play altered slightly and adopted as a Four-rock Free Guard Zone for international competition shortly after. Canada kept to the traditional rules until a three-rock Free Guard Zone rule was adopted, starting in the 1993-94 season. After several years of having the three-rock rule used for the Canadian championships and the winners then having to adjust to the four-rock rule in the World Championships, the [[Canadian Curling Association]] adopted the now-standard Free Guard Zone in the 2002-2003 season.

This rule, a relatively recent addition to curling, was added in response to a strategy of &quot;peeling&quot; opponents' guard stones (knocking them out of play at an angle that caused the shooter's stone to also roll out of play, leaving no stones on the ice). A team in the lead would often employ this strategy during the game. By knocking all stones out, the opponents could at best score one point (if they had the [[Curling#Hammer|hammer]]). Alternatively, the team with the hammer could peel rock after rock, which would blank the end, keeping the last rock advantage for another end. This strategy had developed (mostly in Canada) as ice-makers had become skilled at creating a predictable ice surface and the adoption of brushes allowed greater control over the rock. While a sound strategy, this made for an unexciting game. The 1990 [[Tim Hortons Brier|Brier]] was considered by many curling fans as boring to watch because of the near-constant peeling, and the quick adoption of the Free Guard Zone the following year reflected how disliked this aspect of the game had become.

One strategy that has been developed by curlers in response to the Free Guard Zone ([[Kevin Martin (curler)|Kevin Martin]] from [[Alberta]] is one of the best examples) is the &quot;tick&quot; game, where a shot is made attempting to knock (tick) the guard to the side, far enough that it is difficult or impossible to use but still remaining in play while the shot itself goes out of play. The effect is functionally identical to peeling the guard but significantly harder, as a shot that hits the guard too hard (knocking it out of play) results in its being replaced, while not hitting it hard enough can result in its still being tactically useful for the opposition. There's also a greater chance that the shot will miss the guard entirely because of the greater accuracy required to make the shot. Because of the difficulty of making this type of shot, only the best teams will normally attempt it, and it does not dominate the game the way the peel formerly did. [[Steve Gould (curler)|Steve Gould]] from [[Manitoba]] popularized ticks played across the face. These are easier to make because they impart less speed on the object stone, therefore increasing the chance that its remains in play even if a bigger chunk of it is hit.

=== Hammer === &lt;!--This section is linked from [[Hammer (disambiguation)]]--&gt;
Last-rock or last-stone advantage in an end is called the ''hammer''. Before the game, teams typically decide who gets the hammer in the first end either by chance (such as a coin toss), by a &quot;draw-to-the-button&quot; contest, where a representative of each team shoots a single stone to see who gets closer to the centre of the rings, or, particularly in tournament settings like the [[Winter Olympics]], by a comparison of each team's win-loss record. In all subsequent ends, the hammer belongs to the team that did not score in the preceding end. In the event that neither team scores, the hammer remains with the same team. Naturally, it is easier to score points with the hammer than without; in tournament play, the team with the hammer generally tries to score two or more points. If only one point is possible, the skip will often try to avoid scoring at all in order to retain the hammer until the next end, when two or more points may lie. This is called a ''blank end''. Scoring without the hammer is commonly referred to as ''stealing'', or ''a steal'', and is much more difficult.

=== Strategy ===
Curling is a game of strategy, tactics and skill. The strategy depends on the team's skill, the opponent's skill, the conditions of the ice, the score of the game, how many ends remain and whether the team has last-stone advantage (the ''hammer''). A team may play an end aggressively or defensively. Aggressive playing will put a lot of stones in play by throwing mostly draws; this makes for an exciting game and is very risky but the reward can be very great. Defensive playing will throw a lot of hits preventing a lot of stones in play; this tends to be less exciting and less risky. A good drawing team will usually opt to play aggressively, while a good hitting team will opt to play defensively.

[[File:Curlingdiagram.svg|thumb|left|187px|Diagram of the play area in curling, showing the four-foot zone, corner guard, and centre line guard]]

If a team does not have the hammer in an end, it will opt to try and clog up the four-foot zone in the house to deny the opposing team access to the button. This can be done by throwing &quot;centre line&quot; guards in front of the house on the centre line, which can be tapped into the house later or drawn around. If a team has the hammer, they will try to keep this four-foot zone free so that they have access to the button area at all times. A team with the hammer may throw a ''corner guard'' as their first stone of an end placed in front of the house but outside the four-foot zone to utilize the free guard zone. Corner guards are key for a team to score two points in an end, because they can either draw around it later or hit and roll behind it, making the opposing team's shot to remove it more difficult.

Ideally, the strategy in an end for a team with the hammer is to score two points or more. Scoring one point is often a wasted opportunity, as they will then lose last-rock advantage for the next end. If a team can't score two points, they will often attempt to &quot;blank an end&quot; by removing any leftover opposition rocks and rolling out; or, if there are no opposition rocks, just throwing the rock through the house so that no team scores any points, and the team with the hammer can try again the next end to score two or more with it. Generally, a team without the hammer would want to either force the team with the hammer to only one point (so that they can get the hammer back) or &quot;steal&quot; the end by scoring one or more points of their own.

Generally, the larger the lead a team will have in a game, the more defensively they should play. By hitting all of the opponent's stones, it removes opportunities for their getting multiple points, therefore defending the lead. If the leading team is quite comfortable, leaving their own stones in play can also be dangerous. Guards can be drawn around by the other team, and stones in the house can be tapped back (if they are in front of the tee line) or frozen onto (if they are behind the tee line). A frozen stone is difficult to remove, because it is &quot;frozen&quot; (in front of and touching) to the opponents stone. At this point, a team will opt for &quot;peels&quot;, meaning that the stones they throw will be to not only hit their opposition stones, but to roll out of play as well. Peels are hits that are thrown with the most amount of power.{{clr}}

=== Conceding a game ===
It is not uncommon at any level for a losing team to terminate the match before all ends are completed if it believes it no longer has a realistic chance of winning. Playoff games at national and world championships require eight ends to be completed before allowing a losing team to concede in this manner. Competitive games will usually end once the losing team has &quot;run out of rocks&quot;—that is, once it has fewer stones in play and/or available for play than the number of points needed to tie the game in the final end.

When a team feels it is impossible or near impossible to win a game, they will usually shake hands with the opposing team to concede defeat. This may occur at any point during the game, but usually happens near the final end. In the Winter Olympics, a team may concede after finishing any end during a round-robin game, but can only concede after finishing eight ends during the knockout stages.

[[File:Curling metering.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Measuring which stone is closest to the centre of the house]]

Unlike other sports, there is no negative connotation associated with conceding in curling. In fact, in many competitions, a team is required to concede when it is mathematically impossible for them to tie a game. In more social situations, it is often considered a breach of etiquette (or at least looked down upon) to keep playing when the game is well out of reach.

=== Dispute resolution ===
Most decisions about rules are left to the skips, although in official tournaments, decisions may be left to the officials. However, all scoring disputes are handled by the third, or vice skip. No players other than the third from each team should be in the house while score is being determined. In tournament play, the most frequent circumstance in which a decision has to be made by someone other than the third is the failure of the thirds to agree on which stone is closest to the button. An independent official (supervisor at Canadian and World championships) then measures the distances using a specially designed device that pivots at the centre of the button. When no independent officials are available, the thirds measure the distances.

== Scoring ==
[[File:curlingscore.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A typical curling scoreboard used at clubs, which use a method of scoring different from the ones used on television]]
The winner is the team having the highest number of accumulated points at the completion of ten ends. Points are scored at the conclusion of each of these ends as follows: when each team has thrown its eight stones the team with the stone closest to the button wins that end, the winning team is then awarded one point for each of its own stones lying closer to the button than the opponent's closest stone. The positions of all the other opponent’s stones other than the closest make no difference to the score.

Only stones that are ''in the house'' are considered in the scoring. A stone is in the house if it lies within the {{convert|12|ft|m|sing=on}} zone or any portion of its edge lies over the edge of the ring. Since the bottom of the stone is rounded, a stone just barely in the house will not have any actual contact with the ring, which will pass under the rounded edge of the stone, but it still counts. This type of stone is known as a ''biter''.

It may not be obvious to the eye which of two rocks is closer to the button (center) or if a rock is actually biting or not. There are specialized devices to make these determinations, but these cannot be brought out until after an end is completed. Therefore, a team may make strategic decisions during an end based on assumptions of rock position that turn out to be incorrect.

The score is marked on a [[scoreboard]], of which there are two types; the baseball type and the club scoreboard.

'''The baseball-type scoreboard''' was created for televised games and is simpler to read. The ''ends'' are marked by columns 1 through 10 (or 11 for the possibility of an extra end to break ties) plus an additional column for the total. Below this are two rows, one for each team, containing the team's score for that end and their total score in the right hand column.

'''The club scoreboard''' is traditional and used in most curling clubs. Scoring on this board only requires the use of (up to) 11 digit cards, whereas with baseball-type scoring an unknown number of multiples of the digits (especially low digits like ''1'') may be needed. The numbered centre row represents all possible accumulated scores,  the numbers placed in the team rows represents the end in which that team achieved that cumulative score. If the red team scores three points in the first end (called a ''three-ender''), then a 1 (indicating the first end) is placed beside the number 3 in the red row. If they score two more in the second end, then a 2 will be placed beside the 5 in the red row, indicating that the red team has five points in total (3+2). This scoreboard works because only one team can get points in an end. However, some confusion may arise if neither team scores points in an end, this is called a ''blank end''.  The blank end numbers are usually listed in the farthest column on the right in the row of the team that has the ''hammer'' (last rock advantage), or on a special spot for blank ends.

The following example illustrates the difference between the two types. The example illustrates the men's final at the [[Curling at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Olympics]].

Eight points &amp;ndash; all the rocks thrown by one team counting &amp;ndash; is the highest score possible in an end, and is known as an &quot;eight-ender&quot; or &quot;snowman&quot;. Scoring an eight-ender against a relatively competent team is very difficult; in curling, it is considered the equivalent of pitching a [[perfect game]] in baseball. Probably the best-known snowman came at the 2006 [[Players' Championships]]. Future (2007) World Champion [[Kelly Scott]] scored eight points in one of her games against 1998 World bronze medalist [[Cathy King]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curlingzone.com/forums/scores/index.php?tournamentgameid=48621&amp;tournamentid=1309 &quot;Shooting Percentages&quot;] on CurlingZone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC6Dap35B_Y |title=Curling 8 Ender |publisher=[[You Tube]] |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Curling culture ==
[[File:FingaskCurlingfromILN crop.jpg|325px|thumb|right|The [[Fingask Castle|Fingask]] Curling Club, Perthshire, Scotland, in 1854&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;[[:File:FingaskCurlingfromILN.jpg|full size image]]&lt;/center&gt; ]]
Competition teams are normally named after the Skip, for example, Team Martin for skip Kevin Martin. Amateur league players can (and do) creatively name their teams, but when in competition (a bonspiel) the official team will have a standard name.

Top curling championships are typically played by all-male or all-female teams. The game is known as [[mixed curling]] when a team consists of two men and two women. The [[Canadian Mixed Curling Championship]] is the highest-level mixed curling competition, in the absence of world championship or Olympic mixed curling events.

Curling is played in many countries including Canada, [[United Kingdom]] (especially [[Scotland]]), the [[United States]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]] and [[Japan]], all of which compete in the world championships.

Curling is particularly popular in [[Canada]]. Improvements in ice making and changes in the rules to increase scoring and promote complex strategy have increased the already high popularity of the sport in Canada, and large television audiences watch annual curling telecasts, especially the [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts]] (the national championship for women), the [[Tim Hortons Brier]] (the national championship for men), and the women's and men's world championships.

Despite the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]]'s small population (ranked 5th of 10 Canadian provinces), Manitoban teams have won the Brier more times than teams from any other province. The Tournament of Hearts and the Brier are contested by [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial and territorial]] champions, and the world championships by national champions.

Curling is the provincial sport of [[Saskatchewan]]. From there [[Ernie Richardson]] and his family team dominated Canadian and international curling during the late 1950s and early 1960s and have been considered to be the best male curlers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;CBC Television, [http://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/curlingrichardsons.html ''Kings of the World: The Curling Richardsons''] (March 13, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandra Schmirler]] led her team to the first ever gold medal in women's curling in the [[1998 Winter Olympics]]. When she died two years later from [[cancer]], over 15,000 people attended her funeral, and it was broadcast on national television.

=== An amateur sport ===
While Canadian bonspiels (tournaments) offer cash prizes, there are very few full-time professional curlers. However, some curlers make a considerable portion of their income from curling. Still, curling survives as a people's sport, returning to the [[Winter Olympics]] in 1998 with men's and women's tournaments after not having been on the official Olympic program since 1924 (that year's curling competition, for men only, was confirmed as official by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 2006). Because accuracy, strategy, skill, and experience are more valuable in curling than traditional sports virtues of speed, stamina, and strength, most competitive curlers are older than their counterparts in other sports. However, there are many young teams who turn heads, and junior curling is quite popular, with national finals being televised nationwide in Canada.

=== Good sportsmanship ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Curling]] --&gt;
More so than in many team sports, good [[sportsmanship]] is an integral part of curling. Even at the highest levels of play, players are expected to &quot;call their own fouls&quot;, so to speak, such as alerting the opposing skip if they &quot;burned&quot; a stone. A match traditionally begins with players shaking hands and saying &quot;Good Curling&quot; to each member of the opposing team. It is also traditional for the winning team to buy the losing team a drink after the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;besthealth&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.besthealthmag.ca/get-healthy/fitness/how-one-woman-fell-in-love-with-curling |title=How one woman fell in love with curling |last=Pearson |first=Patricia |date=March/April 2009 |accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often referred to as the Spirit of Curling. This tradition is in contrast to the games of [[darts]] where the loser traditionally buys the winner a drink by way of congratulations.

As noted above in the game play section, it is not uncommon for a team to concede a curling match after it believes it no longer has a reasonable chance of winning but before all ends are completed. Concession is an honourable act and does not carry the stigma associated with quitting, and allows for more socializing. To concede a match, members of the losing team remove their curling gloves (if they wear them) and offer congratulatory handshakes to the winning team. Thanks and wishes of future good luck are usually exchanged between the teams.

=== Special needs in curling ===
{{Main|Wheelchair curling}}
Curling has been adapted for wheelchair users and people otherwise unable to throw the stone from the hack. These curlers may use a special device known as a &quot;curler's cue&quot; or &quot;delivery stick&quot;. The cue holds on to the handle of the stone and is then pushed along by the curler. At the end of delivery, the curler pulls back on the cue, which releases it from the stone. The [[Canadian Curling Association]] ''Rules of Curling'' allows the use of a delivery stick in club play but does not permit it in championships.

== Terminology ==
An extensive glossary of terminology is given in [[Glossary of curling]]. Terms used to describe the game include:

The ice in the game may be ''fast'' or ''slow''. If the ice is fast, a rock will travel farther with a given amount of weight (throwing force) on it. The speed of the ice is measured in seconds. One such measure known as &quot;hog-to-tee&quot; is the amount of time that a rock will take from the moment that it crosses the hog line at the throwing end to come to rest at the tee line at the playing end. If the ice is slow, the rock will have to have more weight in order to reach the tee line and would reach the tee line more quickly. Increasing the weight of the rock will increase the momentum of the rock. Thus, the speed of the ice (in seconds) is lower if the ice is slow than if the ice is fast, in which case the rock would have to be thrown more slowly and would take longer to get there. The time is longer because the stone takes longer to slow down the keener the ice.

''The &quot;hog-to-hog&quot; speed'' is the speed of the stone and is the time in seconds the rock takes from the moment it crosses the near hog line till it crosses the far hog line. If this number is lower, the rock is moving faster, so again low numbers mean more speed. The ice in a match will be somewhat consistent and thus this measure of speed can also be used to measure how far down the ice the rock will travel. Once it is determined that a rock taking (for example) 9 seconds to go from hog line to hog line will stop on the tee line, the curler can know that if the hog-to-hog time is matched by a future stone, that stone will likely stop at approximately the same location. As an example, on keen ice, common times might be 16 seconds for guards, 14 seconds for draws, and 9 seconds for peel weight.

''The back line to hog line speed'' is used principally by sweepers to get an initial sense of the weight of a stone. As an example, on keen ice, common times might be 4.0 seconds for guards, 3.8 seconds for draws, 3.2 for normal hit weight, and 2.9 seconds for peel weight. Especially at the club level, this metric can be misleading, due to amateurs sometimes pushing stones on release, causing the stone to travel faster than the back-to-hog speed.

== In popular culture ==
{{in popular culture|date=April 2011}}
*In ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' (1965) the second film made by [[The Beatles]], the group is shown curling on a frozen lake in the [[Austrian Alps]], with [[George Harrison|George]] delivering stones and the others sweeping away snow with old-fashioned brooms. One of the film's villains hands George a curling stone with a smoking bomb in it, which he delivers. Seeing the smoke, he warns about the &quot;fiendish thingy&quot;, and everyone runs away. When the bomb explodes, making a hole in the ice, an [[List of successful English Channel swimmers|English Channel swimmer]] emerges, asking for directions to the [[White Cliffs of Dover]]. [[John Lennon|John]] obliges him by pointing the way.

* The 2002 Canadian film ''[[Men With Brooms]]'', starring and directed by [[Paul Gross]], centres on the sport of curling, telling the story of a curling team from a small Canadian town as they work through their respective life issues and struggle to win the championship for the sake of their late coach. The film grossed over $4.2 million, all of it in Canada, making it the top-grossing Canadian English film subsidized by [[Telefilm Canada]] between 1997 and 2002.
* The popular Canadian sitcom ''[[Corner Gas]]'' aired an episode entitled &quot;Hurry Hard&quot; (Season 2, Episode 11) that focused on the Dog River residents' pursuit of the Clavet Cup, a fictional curling trophy.
* [[Jonathan Coulton]]'s song &quot;Curl&quot;, from the 2006 album ''Thing-a-Week Two'', is about curling.
* In the &quot;[[Boy Meets Curl]]&quot; episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', first aired in 2010, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson]] form a mixed-doubles curling team that qualifies for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]].
* The CBC sitcom &quot;[[Little Mosque on the Prairie]]&quot; includes an episode called &quot;Jihad on Ice,&quot; in which the characters form a curling team to address the notion that Muslims can't curl.

'''Craven Cottage''' is the name of a football [[stadium]] in the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|Hammersmith and Fulham]] area that has been the home ground of the [[association football]] team [[Fulham F.C.]] since 1896.
After major refurbishment work was carried out in 2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;www.fulhamfc.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/CravenCottage.aspx Fulham Football Club Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; the ground's capacity has increased gradually from 22,000 to its current capacity of 25,700. Fulham have recorded four record attendances in the 2009–2010 season, in their 0–1 loss to [[Arsenal]] and their 3–1, 3–0 and 2–1 victories over [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester United]] and [[Hamburg SV]] respectively, each of which drew full capacity crowds.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.skysports.com Fulham 3 - 0 Man Utd&quot;&gt;[http://www.skysports.com/football/match_facts/0,19762,11065_3150401,00.html Match facts Fulham 3 – 0 Man Utd, Sky Sports]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www.skysports.com Fulham 3 - 1 Liverpool&quot;&gt;[http://www.skysports.com/football/match_facts/0,19762,11065_3149954,00.html Match facts Fulham 3 – 1 Liverpool, Sky Sports]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www.skysports.com Fulham 0 - 1 Arsenal&quot;&gt;[http://www.skysports.com/football/match_facts/0,19762,11065_3149601,00.html Match facts Fulham 0 – 1 Arsenal, Sky Sports]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located next to [[Bishop's Park (Fulham)|Bishop's Park]] on the banks of the [[River Thames]]. 'Crave Cottage' was originally a royal hunting lodge and has history dating back over 300 years.
The stadium has been used by the [[Australia national association football team|Australian national football team]] for some friendly matches due to a large [[Expatriate|expat]] population living in [[England]] (mainly in [[London]]). The [[Republic of Ireland national football team]] also played two games at the venue during the construction of the [[Aviva Stadium]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|December 2009|date=January 2010}}

===Pre-Fulham===
[[Image:Craven Cottage LH4736.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Craven Cottage on the banks of the [[River Thames]]]]
The original 'Cottage' was built in 1780, by [[William Craven, 6th Baron Craven|William Craven]], the sixth [[Baron Craven]] and was located on the centre circle of the pitch. At the time, the surrounding areas were woods which made up part of [[Anne Boleyn]]'s hunting grounds. Several other sports are presumed to have taken place here besides hunting. As well as more lethargic games such as [[lawn bowls]] and [[croquet]], a version of the [[Aztec]] game called '[[tlachtli]]' (scoring a ball through a hoop using your hips) is alleged to have been played here. This game is thought to be a distant cousin of association football and is arguably one of the earliest codes of organised football.

It was lived in by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] (who wrote ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'') and other somewhat notable (and moneyed) persons until it was destroyed by fire in May 1888. Many rumours persist between Fulham fans of past tenants of Craven Cottage. [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]],   [[Jeremy Bentham]],  [[Florence Nightingale]] and even [[Queen Victoria]] are assumed to have stayed there, though these are all likely to have been fabricated. Following the fire, the site was abandoned. Fulham had had 8 previous grounds before settling in at Craven Cottage for good. Therefore, The Cottagers have had 10 grounds overall (if including [[Loftus Road]]) meaning only their 'landlords' and rival [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] has had more home grounds (14) in British football. Of particular note, was [[Ranelagh House]], Fulham's palatial home from 1886–1888.

===Under construction: 1894–1905===
When representatives of Fulham first came across the land, in 1894, it was so overgrown that it took two years to be made suitable for football to be played on it. A deal had been done that meant this work was done by the owners of the ground, who then would receive a proportion of the gate receipts.

The first event at which there were any gate receipts was when Fulham played against Minerva in the [[Middlesex Senior Cup]], on 10 October 1886. The ground's first stand was built shortly after. Described as looking like an &quot;orange box&quot;, it consisted of four wooden structures each holding some 250 seats, and later was affectionately nicknamed the &quot;Rabbit [[Hutch (animal cage)|hutch]]&quot;.

[[Image:Craven Cottage.JPG|thumb|right|The Cottage Pavilion dates back to 1905]]
Before the ground could become too well established, the now defunct [[London County Council]] became concerned with the level of safety at the ground, and tried to get it closed. A court case followed in January 1905, as a result of which [[Archibald Leitch]], a Scottish [[architect]] who had risen to prominence after his building of [[Ibrox stadium|Ibrox]] a few years prior, was hired to work on the stadium. In a scheme costing £15,000 (a record for the time), he had a new pavilion (the modern Cottage itself) and a stand built, in his characteristic [[red brick]] style.

The stand on Stevenage Road celebrated its centenary in the 2005–2006 season and, following the death of Fulham FC's favourite son, former England captain [[Johnny Haynes]], in a car accident in October 2005 the Stevenage Road Stand was renamed the [[Johnny Haynes]] Stand after the club sought the opinions of Fulham supporters.

[[Image:Fulham Football Club - geograph.org.uk - 577777.jpg|thumb|right|The facade of the Johnny Haynes stand]]
Both the [[Johnny Haynes]] Stand and Cottage remain among the finest examples of [[Archibald Leitch]] football architecture to remain in existence and this has been recognised with both being designated as Grade II listed buildings.

===Establishing itself as a stadium===
An [[England national football team|England]] v [[Wales national football team|Wales]] match was played at the ground in 1911, followed by a [[rugby league]] international between [[England national rugby league team|England]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]].

One of the club's directors [[Henry Norris (businessman)|Henry Norris]], and his friend William Hill, took over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the early 1910s, the plan being to merge them with Fulham, to form a &quot;London superclub&quot; at Craven Cottage. This move was largely motivated by Fulham's failure thus far to gain promotion to the top division of English football. There was also plans for Henry Norris to build a larger stadium on the other side of Stevenage Road but there was little need after the failed merger.

The ground again suffered a scare in 1933, when there were plans to demolish it and start again from scratch with a new ground, to have a huge capacity of 80,000. These plans never materialised mainly due to the [[Great Depression]].

On 8 October 1938, Craven Cottage held host to 49,335 fans during a game against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. During the 1930-60's era, Fulham often averaged over 45,000. However, the official attendances can be considered somewhat dubious in this era as many fans would get in by climbing over the fence from Bishops Park into the Putney End. Like many other grounds, fans would sneak in through the turnstiles as well (and not be counted) so this [[Boot money scandal|boot money]] would be given to the players (stuffed in their boots) and would not be counted in the gate money. The ground hosted several football games for the [[1948 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948.pdf 1948 Summer Olympics official report.] pp. 45-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-War===
It wasn't until Fulham first reached the top division, in 1949, that further improvements were made to the stadium. The first was that the next year they became the final side in the division to erect floodlights. The floodlights were said to be the most expensive in Europe at the time as they were so modern. The lights were like large pylons towering 50 metres over the ground and were similar in appearance to those at the [[WACA Ground|WACA]]. The Hammersmith end had a roof put over it, and an electronic scoreboard was put up.

[[Image:Johnny Haynes statue.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Johnny Haynes]], Fulham's most famous player, in his classic 'hand-on-hip' pose, outside the stand named after him]]
After Fulham was relegated, the development continued. The Riverside terracing, infamous for the fact that fans occupying it would turn their heads annually to watch [[The Boat Race]] pass, was replaced by what was officially named the 'Eric Miller stand', Eric Miller being a director of the club at the time. The stand, which cost 334,000 pounds and held 4,200 seats, was opened with a friendly game against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in February 1972, (which included Eusebio). Miller committed suicide five years later after a political and financial scandal that he was involved in boiled over. The stand is now better known as the Riverside Stand. The Riverside bank also was unique for the fact that flags of all the other teams of the first division were flown along the promenade.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

On [[Boxing Day]] 1963, Craven Cottage was the venue of the fastest [[hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]] in the history of the English football league, which was completed in less than three minutes, by [[Graham Leggat]]. This helped his Fulham team to beat [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich]] 10–1 (a club record).&lt;ref&gt;Three minutes is the time quoted by [http://www.grahamleggatsoccer.com/memories.htm his official website].&lt;/ref&gt; The international record is held by [[Jimmy O'Connor]], an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] player who notched up his hat trick in 2 minutes 13 seconds in 1967.

Between 1980 and 1984, '''Fulham [[rugby league]]''' played their home games at the Cottage. They have since evolved into the '''London Crusaders''', the '''London Broncos''', and then into [[Harlequins Rugby League]]. Craven Cottage held the team's largest ever crowd at any ground was 15,013, at a game against [[Wakefield Trinity Wildcats|Wakefield Trinity]] on 15 February 1981.

===Modern times===
[[File:Craven Cottage Stevenage Road Stand.jpg|thumb|right|Craven Cottage prior to the implementation of the [[Taylor report]].]]
When the [[Hillsborough disaster]] occurred, Fulham were in the second bottom rung of [[The Football League]], but following the [[Taylor report]] Fulham's ambitious chairman Jimmy Hill tabled plans for an all-seater stadium. These plans never came to fruition, partly due to local residents' pressure groups, and by the time Fulham reached the [[Premier League|Premiership]], they still had standing areas in the ground, something virtually unheard of at the time. A year remained to do something about this (teams reaching the second tier for the first time are allowed a three-year period to reach the required standards for the top two divisions), but by the time the last league game was played there, against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on 27 April 2002, no building plans had been made. Two more [[Intertoto Cup]] games were played there later that year (against [[Egaleo FC]] of Greece and [[FC Haka]] of Finland), and the eventual solution was to decamp to [[Loftus Road]], home of local rivals [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]]. During this time, many Fulham fans only went to away games in protest of moving from Craven Cottage. 'Back to the Cottage', later to become the 'Fulham Supporters Trust', was set up as a fans pressure group to encourage the chairman and his advisers that Craven Cottage was the only viable option for Fulham Football Club.

After one and a half seasons at Loftus Road, no work had been done on the Cottage. In December 2003, plans were unveiled for £8million worth of major refurbishment work to bring it in line with Premier League requirements. With planning permission granted, work began in January 2004 in order to meet the deadline of the new season. The work proceeded as scheduled and the club were able to return to their home for the start of the [[FA Premier League 2004-05|2004–05 season]]. Their first game in the new-look 22,000 all-seater stadium was a pre-season friendly against Watford on July 10, 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.fulhamfc.com&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Australia vs New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|[[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] vs [[New Zealand national soccer team|New Zealand]] friendly match at in 2005]]
The current stadium is one of the [[Premier League|Premiership's]] smallest grounds (in 2007–08 it was fourth-smallest, after [[Fratton Park]], the [[DW Stadium]] and the [[Madejski Stadium]]). Much admired for its fine architecture, the stadium has recently hosted a few international games, mostly including [[Australia national football team|Australia]]. This venue is suitable for Australia because most of the country's top players are based in Europe, and West London has a significant community of [[expatriate]] Australians. Also, [[Greece national football team|Greece]] vs. [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]] was also hosted on 6 February 2007. Craven Cottage often hosts many other events such as 5-a-side football tournaments and weddings. Also, many have Sunday Lunch at the Riverside restaurant or the 'Cottage Cafe' on non-match days. Craven Cottage recently hosted the 2006 [[Oxbridge]] Varsity Football match prior to the famous '[[The Boat Race]]', as well as having a [[Soccer Aid]] warm-up match. The half-time entertainment often includes the SW6ers (previously called The Cravenettes) which are a group of female cheerleaders. However, other events have included brass bands, [[Michael Jackson]] (albeit just walking around as opposed to performing), [[Travis (band)|Travis]] playing, Arabic dancing, [[keepie uppie]] professionals and presentational awards. Most games also feature the 'Fulham flutter', a half-time draw; and a shoot-out competition of some kind, usually involving scoring through a 'hoop' or 'beat the goalie'. On the first home game of the season, there is a carnival where every Fulham fan is expected to turn up in black-and-white colours. There is usually live rock bands, player signings, clowns, stilt walkers, a steel (calypso) band, food stalls and a free training session for children in Bishops Park.

The [[Fulham L.F.C.|Fulham Ladies]] (before their demise)&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/women/4988138.stm Fulham pull plug on women's team – BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt; and Reserve teams occasionally play home matches at the Cottage. Other than this, they generally play at the club's training ground at [[Motspur Park]] or at [[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]] and [[AFC Wimbledon|AFC Wimbledon's]] stadium, [[Kingsmeadow]]. Craven Cottage is known by several affectionate nicknames from fans, including: The (River) Cottage, The Fortress (or Fortress Fulham), Thameside, The Friendy Confines, SW6, Lord of the Banks, The House of Hope, The Pavilion of Perfection, The 'True' Fulham Palace and The Palatial Home. The Thames at the banks of the Cottage is often referred to as 'Old Father' or [[The River of Dreams]]. The easiest way (though it's still quite hard) to get to the ground is to walk through Bishops Park, often known as 'The Green Mile' by Fulham fans (as it is roughly a mile walk through pleasant greenery).

===Plans===
Craven Cottage is where most Fulham fans would like to be, although the club might prefer a more lucrative situation – a larger ground enabling greater ticket revenue. Whether the club is still looking for a new site for a stadium is unknown, but comments in summer 2004 from Fulham's [[CEO]] at the time, Jim Hone, suggest Fulham are back home for good. Fulham's move back to the Cottage is believed to have been instigated and financed by the sale of [[Louis Saha]] to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], as his transfer covered the £9 million bill. Plans to move to White City with QPR into a 40,000 all-seater stadium appear to have been put firmly on hold. Fulham now have more realistic expectations of aiming for a mid-table finish and ensuring Premiership survival. The board seem to have moved away from their grandiose ideas of making Fulham the &quot;Manchester United of the south&quot; as Al-Fayed has come to realise how expensive it is to subsidise a Premiership outfit. Fulham appear to be committed to a gradual increase of the ground's capacity every summer between seasons. The capacity of Craven Cottage has been increased during the summer for the past 3 years and this trend increased in 2008 with a small increase in the capacity of the Hammersmith End. Fulham previously announced that they are planning to increase the capacity of Craven Cottage by 4000 seats,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/News/NewsArticles/2007/October/CottageRelease.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; but this is yet to be implemented. Owing to Fulham's success in becoming a well-known Premier League club, their success in domestic and European Cups and the size of the ground, many games have sold out extremely fast. It is expected that the capacity will be increased by at least 1,000 seats over the Summer after the end of the 2009–2010 season.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

==The ground as it stands==
===Hammersmith End===
[[Image:The Hammersmith End - Fulham FC, SW6 - geograph.org.uk - 934070.jpg|thumb|right|The Hammersmith End]]
The [[Hammersmith]] End (or Hammy) is the northernmost stand in the ground, and, hence the name, the closest to Hammersmith. It is situated such that looking out from the stand you can see the Putney End and the Cottage opposite, the Riverside Stand (and the river itself) to the right and the [[Johnny Haynes]] Stand to the left. The roofing on the 'Smithy' was financed through the sale of [[Alan Mullery]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]]. It is home to the more vocal Fulham fans,and many stand during games at the back rows of the stand. If Fulham win the toss, they usually choose to play towards the Hammersmith End in the second half.

===Putney End===
The [[Putney]] End is the southernmost stand in the ground, nearest to [[Putney]] and Bishops Park. To its right is The Cottage, opposite is the Hammersmith End, with the Riverside and [[Johnny Haynes]] Stands to left and right respectively. This generally hosts visiting or 'neutral' supporters. When the ground became redeveloped in 2003-4 (during Fulham's exile to Loftus Road) the club applied for a licence to have a designated neutral area. Due to Fulham's past history of having no segregation in the Putney End and having very well-behaved fans, the FA gave Fulham special dispensation to allow for this. Fulham is the only club currently in the UK to have such an area. Fans can wear whatever shirt and support either side in this area, leading to friendly banter. Flags of every nationality in the Fulham squad were hung from the roofing, although they were retracted after the 2006–07 season commenced.

===Riverside Stand===
[[Image:Boat Race Craven Cottage.jpg|thumb|right|The Riverside Stand beside the [[River Thames]]]]
The Riverside was originally terracing that backed onto the Thames. It also featured large advertising hoardings above the fans. By 1973, a proper seated stand had been built called the [[Eric Miller (businessman)|Eric Miller]] Stand (one of the directors at the time). The stand was opened in a prestigious friendly against [[S.L. Benfica]], who included [[Eusebio]] in the team. The name of the stand became called simply The Riverside after the discovery of Eric Miller's suicide, who had been under investigation for fraud and embezzlement.

The Riverside Stand backs onto the [[River Thames]] and is elevated uniquely above the pitch unlike the other 3 stands. It contains the corporate hospitality seating alongside Fulham fans. [[Jimmy Hill]] once referred to the Riverside being &quot;a bit like the London Palladium&quot; as Blocks V &amp; W (the middle section) are often filled with the rich and famous (including often Al-Fayed). There are several [[Harrods]] advertising boardings and above these is the gantry, for the press and cameras. Tickets in this area are often the easiest to buy, not surprisingly they are also some of the more expensive. It has the Hammersmith End to its left, the Putney End to its right and is opposite the [[Johnny Haynes]] Stand. During the 70's, Craven Cottage flooded, with water gushing in from the Riverside. On non-match days, the [[George Cohen]] restaurant is open providing posh-nosh from Harrods or alternatively there is the Cottage Cafe, located near to the Cottage itself. ([[The River Café (London)|The River Café]] is also located nearby). Under [[Tommy Trinder]]'s chairmanship in the 60's, flags of all other teams in the Division 1 were proudly flown along the Thames. However, when Fulham were relegated in 1969, Trinder decided not to change the flags as &quot;Fulham won't be in this division next season&quot;. True to Tommy's prophecy, Fulham were relegated again. There is now a campaign to bring back the flags again.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The Riverside Stand has been used by sponsors, placing adverts on top of the covering, sponsors who have used this include [[Pipex|Pipex.com]] and ([[Lee Cooper|Lee Cooper Jeans]]. The end of the Riverside Stand towards the 'Smithy' End' indicates the end of the 'Fulham Wall', which is the [[Milestone|mile post]] in [[The Boat Race]].

===Johnny Haynes Stand===
[[Image:Ccffc.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Johnny Haynes]] stand at Craven Cottage, is a Grade II* listed building.]]
This stand was formerly named after the street which runs alongside it hence was called the Stevenage Road Stand. Shortly after the untimely passing of one of Fulham's greatest players [[Johnny Haynes]]; on November 27, 2005 it was renamed the Johnny Haynes Stand. It holds home supporters of which a lot are season ticket holders and is located opposite the Riverside Stand, with the Putney End and the Cottage to its left, and the Hammersmith end to the right. This stand includes the ticket office and club shop, as well as nostalgic original wooden seats. There used to be an exact replica built by Leitch at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] which had long been demolished. This remains the oldest stand (dating back to 1905) in the Football League and is thus a Grade II* [[listed building]] (thanks to [[Jimmy Hill]]'s efforts when saving the club as Chairman). (The oldest football stand in the world is considered to belong to [[Great Yarmouth Town]], though [[Wolverton A.F.C.]] dispute this, although this is no longer in use as a football stand) The original wooden Bennet seats as specified by Leitch in 1905 now number 3,571, remain as robust as ever.

Due to parts of the structure being wooden and [[Smoking ban#United Kingdom|the smoking ban]], there is a no-smoking policy in this part of the ground. The exterior facing Stevenage Road has a brick façade rarely seen amongst stadia and features the club's old emblem in the artwork. Decorative pillars show the club's foundation date as 1880 though this is thought to be incorrect. Also, a special stone to commemorate Fulham 2000 and The Cottagers return to 'The Cottage'  was engraved on the façade. The family enclosure is located in the corner nearest to the Hammersmith end. The stand also features very narrow and rickety turnstiles (that all must pass through. The 2006–7 season saw the club introduce new [[RFID]] tickets, which are read electronically when passing through the gates. Where the new plastic seating lies (in front of the wooden seats), originally was a standing area. Children were often placed at the front of this enclosure and the area had a distinctive white picket fence to keep fans off the pitch (up until the 70's).

===The Pavilion===
[[Image:Fulham Football Club, Craven Cottage - geograph.org.uk - 577769.jpg|thumb|right|The Pavilion from outside the stadium]]
The Cottage Pavilion dates back to 1905 along with the [[Johnny Haynes]] Stand, built by renowned architect [[Archibald Leitch]]. The reason The Cottage was built was due to an oversight in the Stevenage Road Stand (as it was then), as Leitch had forgotten to accommodate changing rooms in his final plans. Besides being the changing rooms, the Cottage (also called The Clubhouse) was traditionally used by the players' families and friends who sit on the balcony to watch the game, but the club now sell those seats at a premium game-by-game rate. In the past, board meetings used to be held in The Cottage itself as well. In the three other corners of the ground there are what have been described as large 'filing cabinets', which are corporate boxes on three levels.

* The ground has hosted the most [[Australia national association football team|Socceroo]] matches outside of [[Australia]] and was one of the pioneers in hosting (neutral) international friendlies.
* Fulham were the last team to have standing accommodation in the [[Premier League]], as Craven Cottage included terraces in the [[2001-02 in English football|2001–02 season]] – eight years after the [[Taylor Report]] outlawed terraces at this level.
*The original Craven Cottage site was covered in woodlands. One [[Platanus|plane tree]] survives today in a corner of the Putney End, the sole tree to be found in any British senior football stadium.
*On 3 April 2011, Fulham unveiled a statue of [[Michael Jackson]] outside the stadium before its match with Blackpool. The singer, who died in 2009, attended a Fulham match once and was friends with club chairman [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]], who commissioned the statue.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN, &quot;Michael Jackson statue unveiled.&quot; http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6286197/statue-michael-jackson-unveiled-fulham-home-stadium&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sportshaze.com/england/english-premier-league/english-premier-league-fans-can-go-to-hell-says-fulham-owner-mohamed-al-fayed-2659&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[109 BC]] - Huge confederation composed of the Germanic of [[Cimbri]] and [[Teutones]] and the Celtic-Germanic [[Helvetii]] formed near [[Miltenberg]] in Franconia. The confederation attempts an invasion of Italy but is defeated by [[Gaius Marius]] in the battles of [[Aquae Sextiae]] ([[102 BC]]) and [[Battle of Vercellae|Vercellae]] ([[101 BC]])

*[[8 BC|8]]-[[6 BC]] - [[Marcomanni]] from the northern [[Bavaria]]n and [[Main (river)|Main]] river area went to the original homeland of the [[Boii]] in Boemia [[Bohemia]] and under king [[Marbod]] formed a Confederation of Marcomanni, [[Lugii]], [[Semnoni|Semnones]], [[Langobardi|Lombards]], and others. Under king [[Ariovistus]] they fought against take-overs by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Caesar Augustus]].

'''Cedar Falls''' is a city in [[Black Hawk County, Iowa|Black Hawk County]], Iowa, United States, and it is home to one of Iowa's three public universities, the [[University of Northern Iowa]]. The population was 36,145 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], with a 2009 estimate showing a slight increase to 38,589.&lt;ref&gt;http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFPopulation?_event=Search&amp;geo_id=16000US1922395&amp;_geoContext=01000US|04000US19|16000US1922395&amp;_street=&amp;_county=cedar+falls&amp;_cityTown=cedar+falls&amp;_state=04000US19&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&amp;_useEV=&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=160&amp;_submenuId=population_0&amp;ds_name=null&amp;_ci_nbr=null&amp;qr_name=null&amp;reg=null%3Anull&amp;_keyword=&amp;_industry=&lt;/ref&gt; It has the smaller population of the two principal cities in the [[Waterloo-Cedar Falls metropolitan area]].

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
Cedar Falls was founded in 1845 by William Sturgis. It was originally named Sturgis Falls, for the first family who settled the site.  The Sturgis family moved on within a few years and the city was renamed Cedar Falls because of its proximity to the [[Cedar River (Iowa River)|Cedar River]].  However the city's founders are honored each year with a three day community-wide celebration named in their honor – the Sturgis Falls Celebration.

Because of the availability of water power, Cedar Falls developed as a milling and industrial center prior to the Civil War.  The establishment of the Civil War Soldiers' Orphans Home in Cedar Falls changed the direction in which the city developed when, following the war, it became the first building on the campus of the Iowa State Normal School (now the University of Northern Iowa).

==Geography==

Cedar Falls is located at {{Coord|42|31|25|N|92|26|47|W|type:city}} (42.523520, −92.446402){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 28.9&amp;nbsp;square miles (74.8&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 28.3&amp;nbsp;square miles (73.3&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.6&amp;nbsp;square miles (1.5&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (2.08%) is water.

The '''Cleveland Indians''' are a [[professional baseball|professional baseball team]] based in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. They are in the [[American League Central|Central Division]] of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[American League]]. Since {{Baseball Year|1994}}, they have played in [[Progressive Field]] (formerly Jacobs Field). The team's [[spring training]] facility is in [[Goodyear, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Indians a step closer to taking Spring Training to Arizona |url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=68744 |format= |work= |publisher=WKYC News |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2008-06-20 |language= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since their establishment as a Major League franchise in 1901, the Indians have won two [[World Series]] championships, in [[1920 World Series|1920]] and [[1948 World Series|1948]].  The Indians' drought of 62 years [[List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts|since their last Championship]] is now the longest in the American League, and second only to that of the [[Chicago Cubs]] in all of MLB.

The &quot;Indians&quot; name originates from a request by the club owner to decide on a new name, following the 1914 season. In reference to the Boston Braves (now the [[Atlanta Braves]]), the media chose &quot;the Indians&quot;{{fact|date=May 2011}}. They are [[List of baseball nicknames|nicknamed]] &quot;the Tribe&quot; and &quot;the Wahoos&quot;. The latter is a reference to the mascot which appears in the team's logos, [[Chief Wahoo]]. 

The Cleveland team originated in 1900 as the Lake Shores, when the American League (AL) was officially a minor league. One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the major league incarnation of the club was founded in Cleveland in {{Baseball Year|1901}}. Originally called the Cleveland Blues, the team played in [[League Park]] until moving permanently to [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]] in {{Baseball Year|1946}}. At the end of the 2010 season, they had a regular season franchise record of 8,691–8,367 (.509). The Indians have won seven [[American League Central|AL Central]] titles, the most in the division.

==Franchise history==
===Cleveland baseball prior to the Indians===
{{see also|Cleveland Forest Citys|Cleveland Blues (NL)|Cleveland Spiders}}
During the [[1869 in baseball|1869]] season, Cleveland was among several cities which established professional baseball teams following the success of the 1869 [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], the first fully professional team. In the newspapers before and after 1870, the team was often called the [[Cleveland Forest Citys|Forest Citys]], as Forest City was and is a common nickname for Cleveland.

In [[1871 in baseball|1871]] the Forest Citys joined the new [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] (NA), the first professional league. Ultimately, two of the league's western clubs went out of business during the first season and the [[1871 Great Chicago Fire|Chicago Fire]] left that city's [[Chicago Cubs|White Stockings]] impoverished, unable to field a team again until [[1874 in baseball|1874]]. Cleveland was thus the NA's westernmost outpost in [[1872 in baseball|1872]], the year the club folded. Cleveland played their full schedule to July 19 followed by two games versus Boston in mid-August and disbanded at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 1872 Cleveland Forest Citys |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1872/TCL101872.htm |publisher=retrosheet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1876 in baseball|1876]], the [[National League]] (NL) supplanted the NA as the major professional league. Cleveland was not among its charter members, but by [[1879 in baseball|1879]] the league was looking for new entries and the city gained an NL team. The [[Cleveland Blues (NL)|Cleveland Blues]] had a mediocre record for six seasons and were ruined by a trade war with the [[Union Association]] (UA) in [[1884 in baseball|1884]], when its three best players ([[Fred Dunlap]], [[Jack Glasscock]], and [[Jim McCormick (pitcher)|Jim McCormick]]) jumped to the UA after being offered higher salaries. The St Louis UA team replaced Cleveland in the NA in [[1885 in baseball|1885]].

Cleveland went without major league baseball for two seasons until gaining a team in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (AA) in [[1887 in baseball|1887]]. After the AA's [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Allegheny club]] jumped to the NL Cleveland followed suit in [[1889 in baseball|1889]], as the AA began to crumble. The Cleveland ballclub, nicknamed the [[Cleveland Spiders|Spiders]] (supposedly inspired by their &quot;skinny and spindly&quot; players) slowly became a power in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Schneider  | first = Russell  | authorlink =  | coauthors =
  | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia  | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC  | year = 2001  | location =  | pages =9
  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC&amp;  | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 1582613761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spiders survived a challenge for fans from the [[Cleveland Infants]], an entry in the one-season [[Players League|Players' League]] in [[1890 in baseball|1890]]. The next year the Spiders moved into [[League Park]], which would serve as the home of Cleveland professional baseball for the next 55 years. Led by native Ohioan [[Cy Young]], the Spiders became a contender in the mid-1890s, when they played in the [[Temple Cup]] Series (that era's World Series) twice, winning it in [[1895 in baseball|1895]]. The team began to fade after this success, and was dealt a severe blow under the ownership of the [[Robison Field|Robison brothers]].

The Robisons, despite already owning the Spiders, were allowed to acquire a controlling interest in the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] franchise in [[1899 in baseball|1899]]. They proceeded to strip the Cleveland team of its best players (including Young) to help fill the St. Louis roster. The St. Louis team improved to finish with a winning record. The Spiders were left with essentially a minor league lineup, and began to lose games at a record pace. Drawing almost no fans at home, they ended up playing most of their season on the road, and became known as &quot;The Wanderers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Hittner  | first = Arthur  | authorlink = | title = Honus Wagner: The Life of Baseball's Flying Dutchman  | publisher = McFarland &amp; Company  | series =  | year = 2003  | doi =  | isbn = 0786418117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team ended the season in 12th place, 84 games out of first place, with an all-time worst record of 20 wins and 134 losses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016661.html Bob Diskin, Special to ESPN.com, ''A pitcher worthy of a trophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the 1899 season, the National League disbanded four teams, including the Cleveland franchise. The disastrous 1899 season would actually be a step toward a new future for Cleveland fans the next year.

===1900–1946: Early to middle history of the franchise===
[[Image:OldClevelandIndiansLogo.jpg|right|thumb|The Cleveland Indians logo from 1946–1950]]

Seeking to capitalize on general public disillusionment with the National League, [[Ban Johnson]] changed the name of his minor league, the [[Western League (original)|Western League]], to the [[American League]] and shifted the WL's Grand Rapids club to Cleveland, taking over [[League Park]] in 1900 as the Cleveland Lake Shores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050620/news_lz1s20major.html Kirk Kenney, San Diego Union Tribune, ''Baseball's moving experience'', June 20, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Although still a minor league, the new organization was ready to make its move. In 1901 the American League broke with the National Agreement and declared itself a competing Major League. The Cleveland franchise was among its eight charter members.

The new team was owned by coal magnate [[Charles Somers]] and tailor Jack Kilfoyl. Somers, a wealthy industrialist and also co-owner of the [[Boston Red Sox|Boston Americans]], lent money to other team owners, including [[Connie Mack (baseball)|Connie Mack]]'s [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]], to keep them and the new league afloat. For its first season as a major league team, it was nicknamed the &quot;Bluebirds,&quot; but the players didn't think the nickname was suitable for a baseball team.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBT&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=0761139435 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers frequently shortened it to &quot;Blues&quot; due to the players' all-blue uniforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001  | location = | pages =11  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC&amp; | doi = | id=

The Blues suffered from financial problems in their first two seasons. This led Somers to seriously consider moving to either [[Pittsburgh]] or [[Cincinnati]]. Relief came in {{By|1902}} as a result of the conflict between the National and American Leagues. In 1901, [[Nap Lajoie|Napoleon &quot;Nap&quot; Lajoie]], the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]' star [[second baseman]], jumped to the A's after his contract was capped at $2,400 per year—one of the highest-profile players to jump to the upstart AL. The Phillies subsequently filed an injunction to force Lajoie's return, which was granted by the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]]. The injunction appeared to doom any hopes of an early settlement between the warring leagues.  However, a lawyer discovered that the injunction was only enforceable in the state of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBT&quot;/&gt;

Mack, partly to thank Somers for his past financial support, agreed to trade Lajoie to the then-moribund Blues, who offered $25,000 salary over three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001  | location = | pages =12–13  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC&amp; | doi = | id= | isbn = 1582613761}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the injunction, however, Lajoie had to sit out any games played against the A's in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Seymour | first = Harold | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Baseball | publisher = Oxford University Press, US | year =1960 | location = | pages =214–215 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=zQO-WWL1v1AC&amp; | doi = | id = | isbn =0195001001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lajoie arrived in Cleveland on June 4 and was an immediate hit, drawing 10,000 fans to League Park. Soon afterward, he was named team captain, and the team was renamed the &quot;Naps&quot; after a newspaper conducted a write-in contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBT&quot;/&gt;

Lajoie was named manager in {{By|1905}}, and the team's fortunes improved somewhat. They finished half a game short of the pennant in 1908.&lt;ref name=1908AL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL_1908.shtml |title=1908 American League Standings |accessdate=2008-06-19 |work=Baseball-reference.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the success did not last and Lajoie resigned during the 1909 season as manager but remained on as a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | pages =319 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC&amp; | doi = | id = | isbn = 1582613761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, the team began to unravel, leading Kilfoyl to sell his share of the team to Somers. [[Cy Young]] who returned to Cleveland in 1909, was ineffective for most of his three remaining years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | pages =413 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC&amp; | doi = | id = | isbn = 1582613761}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Addie Joss]] died from tubercular meningitis prior to the {{Baseball Year|1910}} season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Obituary, Pitcher Joss Dead: Ill Only Few Days |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9B03E6DD1031E233A25756C1A9629C946096D6CF&amp;oref=slogin |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=April 15, 1911 |accessdate=2008-06-20 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a strong lineup anchored by the potent Lajoie and [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]], poor pitching kept the team below third place for most of the next decade. One reporter referred to the team as the Napkins, &quot;because they fold up so easily&quot; while others called them the &quot;Molly McGuires&quot; as a play on their manager's name, [[Deacon McGuire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shoeless: The Life and Times of Joe Jackson |last=Fleitz |first=David L.  |authorlink= |coauthors= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=paqizfFVogIC&amp;dq= |year=2001 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=0786409789 |pages=40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The team hit bottom in 1914 and 1915, finishing in the cellar both years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL_1914.shtml |title=1914 American League Standings |accessdate=2008-06-27 |work=Baseball-reference.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL_1915.shtml |title=1915 American League Standings |accessdate=2008-06-27 |work=Baseball-reference.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1915 brought significant changes to the team. Lajoie, nearly 40 years old was no longer a top hitter in the league, batting only .258 in 1914. With Lajoie engaged in a feud with manager [[Joe Birmingham]], the team sold Lajoie back to Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | pages =321 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC&amp; | doi = | id = | isbn = 1582613761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Lajoie gone, the Naps now needed a new nickname. Somers asked the local newspapers to to ask fans for their favorite nickname, and the name Indians was chosen.  A 1915 editorial in the Cleveland Plain Dealer points to the nickname the Cleveland team team became known for because of having a Native American player on the team -- the first major league baseball team to do so -- during the 1897 and 1898 seasons. His name was Louis Sockalexis; he was the grandson of the Chief of the Bear Clan from the Penobscot Indians, and Cleveland alone allowed him to play when other teams were not asking non-white people to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | pages =23 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC&amp; | doi = | id = | isbn = 1582613761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research indicates that the name &quot;Indians&quot; was favored as a play on the name of the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]], then known as the &quot;Miracle Braves&quot; after going from last place on July 4 to a sweep in the [[1914 World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Our Tribe: A Baseball Memoir |last=Pluto |first=Terry |authorlink= Terry Pluto |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=0684845059 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Somers' business ventures began to fail, leaving him deeply in debt. With the Indians playing poorly, attendance and revenue suffered.&lt;ref name=Somers&gt;{{cite book| author=Lewis, Franklin| chapter=| title=The Cleveland Indians | editor=| publisher=Kent State University Press reprint from Putnam| isbn= 9780873388856
| year=2006| pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Somers decided to trade Jackson midway through the 1915 season for two players and $31,500, one of the largest sums paid for a player at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Ratajczak, Kenneth| chapter=| title=The Wrong Man Out| editor=| publisher=AuthorHouse |year=2008 | isbn= 1434356787| pages=76–77| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=h9URNmfOwFIC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By {{Baseball Year|1916}}, Somers was at the end of his tether and sold the team to a syndicate headed by Chicago railroad contractor [[Jim Dunn (baseball team owner)|James C. &quot;Sunny Jim&quot; Dunn]].&lt;ref name=Somers/&gt;  Manager Lee Fohl, who had taken over in early 1915, acquired two minor league pitchers, [[Stan Coveleski]] and [[Jim Bagby, Sr.|Jim Bagby]] and traded for center fielder [[Tris Speaker]], who was engaged in a salary dispute with the [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | pages =23–24 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC&amp; | doi = | id =  | isbn = 1582613761}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All three would ultimately become key players in bringing a championship to Cleveland.

{{Wide image|1920 Cleveland Indians Pano.jpg|800px|1920 Cleveland Indians|right}}
Speaker took over the reins as [[player-manager]] in {{By|1919}}, and would lead the team to a championship in 1920. On August 16, the Indians were playing the Yankees at the [[Polo Grounds]] in New York. Shortstop [[Ray Chapman]], who often crowded the plate, was batting against [[Carl Mays]], who had an unusual underhand delivery. It was also late in the afternoon and the infield would have been in shadow with the center field area (the batters' background) bathed in sunlight. As well, at the time, &quot;part of every pitcher's job was to dirty up a new ball the moment it was thrown onto the field. By turns, they smeared it with dirt, licorice, tobacco juice; it was deliberately scuffed, sandpapered, scarred, cut, even spiked. The result was a misshapen, earth-colored ball that traveled through the air erratically, tended to soften in the later innings, and as it came over the plate, was very hard to see.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Geoffrey C. |coauthors=Burns, Ken|title=Baseball: An Illustrated History|publisher=Knopf |year=1996|pages=153|isbn=0-679-76541-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, Chapman did not move reflexively when Mays' pitch came his way. The pitch hit Chapman in the head, fracturing his skull. Chapman died the next day, becoming the only player to sustain a fatal injury from a pitched ball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/08.17.html Report of Chapman's Death, New York Times, 8/18/1920]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Indians, who at the time were locked in a tight three-way pennant race with the Yankees and White Sox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Standings – Monday, Aug 16, 1920 |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/games/standings.cgi?date=1920-08-16 | publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; were not slowed down by the death of their teammate. Rookie [[Joe Sewell]] hit .329 after replacing Chapman in the lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ira |last=Berkow |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; When Sewell Replaced Ray Chapman  |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEED61F31F930A25753C1A96F948260|work=New York Times |publisher= |date=1989-10-13 |accessdate=2008-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1920, the [[Black Sox Scandal]] came to a boil. With just a few games left in the season, and Cleveland and Chicago neck-and-neck for first place at 94–54 and 95–56 respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CLE 1920 Cleveland Indians Schedule |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1920&amp;t=CLE |work=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1920 Chicago White Sox Schedule |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1920&amp;t=CHA |publisher=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Chicago owner suspended eight players. The White Sox lost 2 of 3 in their final series, while Cleveland won 4 and lost 2 in their final two series. Cleveland finished 2 games ahead of Chicago and 3 games ahead of the Yankees to win its first pennant, led by Speaker's .388 [[batting average|hitting]], Jim Bagby's 30 [[win (baseball)|victories]] and solid performances from [[Steve O'Neill]] and Stan Coveleski. Cleveland went on to defeat the [[Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Robins]] 5–2 in the [[1920 World Series|World Series]] for their first title, winning four games in a row after the Robins took a 2–1 Series lead. The Series included three memorable &quot;firsts&quot;, all of them in Game 5 at Cleveland, and all by the home team. In the first inning, right fielder [[Elmer Smith (20th century outfielder)|Elmer Smith]] hit the first Series grand slam. In the fourth inning, [[Jim Bagby, Sr.|Jim Bagby]] hit the first Series home run by a pitcher. And in the top of the fifth inning, second baseman [[Bill Wambsganss]] executed the first (and only, so far) unassisted triple play in World Series history, in fact the only Series triple play of any kind.

The team would not reach the heights of 1920 again for 28 years. Speaker and Coveleski were aging and the Yankees were rising with a new weapon: [[Babe Ruth]] and the [[home run]]. They managed two second-place finishes but spent much of the decade in the cellar. In 1927 Dunn's widow, Mrs. George Pross (Dunn had died in 1922), sold the team to a syndicate headed by [[Alva Bradley]].

The Indians were a middling team by the 1930s, finishing third or fourth most years. {{Baseball Year|1936}} brought Cleveland a new superstar in 17-year old pitcher [[Bob Feller]], who came from [[Iowa]] with a dominating [[fastball]]. That season, Feller set a record with 17 strikeouts in a single game and went on to lead the league in strikeouts from 1938–1941. According to [[Fundamentals of Physics]] ( 4 ed., [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]], 1993 ), by [[David Halliday]], [[Robert Resnick]] and [[Jearl Walker]], on page 30, Chapter Two, &quot; Motion along a Straight Line &quot;, [[Joe Sprinz]], at the time in question, a member of the [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]], and formerly of the Indians, attempted to beat the [[World Record]] for catching a baseball dropped from a great height, set by members of the 1938 Cleveland Indians, who had done so at 700 feet, with balls dropped from a building. On a day in 1939, Sprinz had a blimp hover overhead at 800 feet, from which were to be dropped balls for him to catch. On his fifth attempt, a baseball entered his glove at what could be estimated to be up to 154&amp;nbsp;mph. It slammed his glove hand into his face with such force, that he broke his upper jaw in twelve places, fractured five of his teeth, and was rendered unconscious. He also dropped the ball. By {{By|1940}}, Feller, along with [[Ken Keltner]], [[Mel Harder]] and [[Lou Boudreau]] led the Indians to within one game of the pennant. However, the team was wracked with dissension, with some players (including Feller and [[Mel Harder]]) going so far as to request that Bradley fire manager [[Ossie Vitt]]. Reporters lampooned them as the Cleveland Crybabies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=C. Phillip Francis |url=http://www.chatterfromthedugout.com/cleveland_crybabies.htm |title=The Cleveland Crybabies |accessdate=2008-06-27 |work=Chatter from the Dugout|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feller, who had pitched a [[no-hitter]] to open the season and won 27 games, lost the final game of the season to unknown pitcher Floyd Giebell of the [[Detroit Tigers]]. The Tigers won the pennant and Giebell never won another major league game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=DeMaio Brewer |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A National Treasure Calls Wilkes &quot;Home&quot;  |url=http://www.therecordofwilkes.com/rec20000621/index.htm |work=The Record of Wilkes, N.C. |publisher= |date=2000-06-21 |accessdate=2008-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleveland entered 1941 with a young team and a new manager; [[Roger Peckinpaugh]] had replaced the despised Vitt; but the team regressed, finishing in fourth. Cleveland would soon be depleted of two stars. [[Hal Trosky]] retired in 1941 due to migraine headaches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Leighton |last=Housh |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hal Trosky, Norway, 1965  |url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19650404/SPORTS11/50710015 |work=Des Moines Register |publisher= |date=04-04-1965 |accessdate=2008-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bob Feller enlisted in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] two days after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].  Starting third baseman [[Ken Keltner]] and outfielder [[Ray Mack]] were both drafted in 1945 taking two more starters out of the lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia  | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC  | year = 2001  | location =  | pages =52  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC&amp; | doi = | id = | isbn = 1582613761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1947–1959===
In {{Baseball Year|1946}} [[Bill Veeck]] formed an investment group that purchased the Cleveland Indians from Bradley's group for a reported $1.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell

A former owner of a minor league franchise in Milwaukee, Veeck brought to Cleveland a gift for promotion. At one point, Veeck hired rubber-faced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baseball's Clown Prince Dies |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/10/30/archive/main68511.shtml |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2008-02-17 | date=1999-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Patkin]], the &quot;Clown Prince of Baseball&quot; as a coach. Patkin's appearance in the coaching box was the sort of promotional stunt that both delighted fans but infuriated the American League front office.

Recognizing that he had acquired a solid team, Veeck soon abandoned the aging, small and lightless League Park to take up full-time residence in massive [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]].&lt;ref name=Borsvold&gt;{{cite book | last =Borsvold | first = David  | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = The Cleveland Indians: Cleveland Press Years, 1920–1982 | publisher = Arcadia Publishing  | year = 2003 | location = | pages =37–38  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=v0hgrNuScVMC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq= | doi = | id = | isbn = 0738523259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1947 the Indians played most of their games at League Park, and occasionally played weekend games at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. League Park was demolished in 1951, although a portion of the original ticket booth remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070806&amp;content_id=2133242&amp;vkey=cle_gameface&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle |title= League Park may glisten once again|accessdate=2008-06-28 |work= |publisher=Cleveland Indians.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making the most of the cavernous stadium, Veeck had a portable center field fence installed, which he could move in or out depending on how the distance favored the Indians against their opponents in a given series. The fence moved as much as {{convert|15|ft|m|0}} between series opponents. Following the 1947 season, the American League countered with a rule change that fixed the distance of an outfield wall for the duration of a season.  The massive stadium did, however, permit the Indians to set the then record for the largest crowd to see a Major League baseball game.  On October 10, 1948, Game 5 of the [[1948 World Series|World Series]] against the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] drew over 84,000. The record stood until the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] drew a crowd in excess of 92,500 to watch Game 5 of the [[1959 World Series]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] against the [[Chicago White Sox]].

Under Veeck's leadership, one of Cleveland's most significant achievements was breaking the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]] in the [[American League]] by signing [[Larry Doby]], formerly a player for the Negro League's [[Newark Eagles]] in {{By|1947}}, eleven weeks after [[Jackie Robinson]] signed with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers|Dodgers]].&lt;ref name=Borsvold/&gt;  Similar to Robinson, Doby battled racism on and off the field but posted a .301 batting average in 1948, his first full season. A power-hitting center fielder, Doby led the American League twice in homers.

In 1948, needing pitching for the stretch run of the pennant race, Veeck turned to the [[Negro League]] again and signed pitching great [[Satchel Paige]] amid much controversy.&lt;ref name=Borsvold/&gt;  Barred from Major League Baseball during his prime, Veeck's signing of the aging star in 1948 was viewed by many as another publicity stunt. At an official age of 42, Paige became the oldest rookie in Major League baseball history, and the first black pitcher. Paige soon proved he could still pitch and ended the year with a 6–1 record with a 2.48 ERA, 45 strikeouts and two shutouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CLE/1948.shtml |title= Satchel Paige 1948 Statistics|accessdate=2008-06-28 |work=|publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{By|1948}}, veterans Boudreau, Keltner, and [[Joe Gordon]] had career offensive seasons, while newcomers [[Larry Doby]] and [[Gene Bearden]] also had standout seasons. The team went down to the wire with the [[Boston Red Sox]], winning a one-game playoff, the first in American League history, to go to the [[1948 World Series|World Series]]. In the series, the Indians defeated the Boston Braves four games to two for their first championship in 28 years. Boudreau won the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP Award]].

The Indians would appear in a film the following [[1949 in film|year]] titled ''[[The Kid From Cleveland]]'', in which Veeck had an interest.&lt;ref name=Borsvold/&gt;  The film portrayed the team helping out a &quot;troubled teenaged fan&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Kid from Cleveland |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041545/ |publisher=IMDB.com | accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featured many members of the Indians organization. However, filming during the season cost the players valuable rest days leading to fatigue towards the end of the season.&lt;ref name=Borsvold/&gt;  That season, Cleveland again contended before falling to third place. On September 23, 1949, Bill Veeck and the Indians buried their 1948 pennant in center field the day after they were mathematically eliminated from the pennant race.&lt;ref name=Borsvold/&gt;

Later in 1949, Veeck's first wife (who had a half-stake in Veeck's share of the team) divorced him. With most of his money tied up in the Indians, Veeck was forced to sell the team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Ribowsky | first = Mark | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Don't Look Back: Satchel Paige in the Shadows of Baseball  | publisher = De Capo Press  | year = 2000  | location =  | pages =286  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=LT2pirW9nSYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA286&amp;dq= | doi =  | id = | isbn = 030680963X}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a syndicate headed by insurance magnate Ellis Ryan. Ryan was forced out in {{By|1953}} in favor of Myron Wilson, who in turn gave way to William Daley in {{By|1956}}.  Despite this turnover in the ownership, a powerhouse team composed of Feller, Doby, [[Minnie Miñoso]], [[Luke Easter (baseball)|Luke Easter]], [[Bobby Avila]], [[Al Rosen]], [[Early Wynn]], [[Bob Lemon]], and [[Mike Garcia (AL pitcher)|Mike Garcia]] continued to contend through the early 1950s. However, Cleveland only won a single pennant in the decade, finishing second to the [[New York Yankees]] five times.

The best season in franchise history came in {{Baseball Year|1954}}, when the Indians finished the season with a record of 111–43 (.721). That mark set an American League record for wins which stood for 44 years until the [[New York Yankees]] won 114 games in 1998. The Indians 1954 winning percentage of .721 is still an American League record. The Indians returned to the [[1954 World Series|World Series]] to face the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]]. The team could not bring home the title, however, ultimately being upset by the Giants in a sweep. The series was notable for [[Willie Mays]]' famous [[The Catch (baseball)|over-the-shoulder catch]] off the bat of [[Vic Wertz]] in Game 1.

===1960–1993: The 30-year slump===
From 1960 to 1993, the Indians managed one third-place finish (in 1968) and six fourth-place finishes (in 1960, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1990, and 1992) but spent the rest of the time at or near the bottom of the standings.

The Indians hired general manager [[Frank Lane]], known as &quot;Trader&quot; Lane, away from the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in 1957. Lane had gained a reputation as a GM who loved to make deals over the years.  With the White Sox, Lane made over 100 trades involving over 400 players in seven years.&lt;ref name=Cards&gt;{{cite book | last =Eisenbath  | first = Mike  | authorlink =  | coauthors =Stan Musial  | title = The Cardinals Encyclopedia | publisher = Temple University Press  | year = 1999  | location =  | pages =  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=hymGG28xYcoC&amp;pg=PA410&amp;lpg=PA410&amp;dq=  | doi =  | id = | isbn = 1566397030}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a short stint in St. Louis, he traded away [[Red Schoendienst]] and [[Harvey Haddix]].&lt;ref name=Cards/&gt;  Lane summed up his philosophy when he said that the only deals he regretted were the ones that he didn't make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last =Schneider | first = Russell  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Tales from the Tribe Dugout | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2002 | location = | pages = | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ZCNvizFvLy0C&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq= | doi = | id = | isbn = 1582613036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Lane's early trades in Cleveland was to send [[Roger Maris]] to the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City Athletics]] in the middle of 1958.  Indians executive [[Hank Greenberg]] was not happy about the trade&lt;ref name=Maris&gt;{{cite book  | last =Rosenfeld  | first = Harvey  | authorlink =  | coauthors = | title = Still a Legend: The Story of Roger Maris | publisher = iUniverse | year = 2002 | location = | pages = | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=LIQLHXQrAssC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq= | doi = | id = | isbn = 059524615X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and neither was Maris, who said that he could not stand Lane.&lt;ref name=Maris/&gt;  After Maris broke Babe Ruth's home run record, Lane defended himself by saying he still would have done the deal because Maris was unknown and he received good ballplayers in exchange.&lt;ref name=Maris/&gt;

After the Maris trade, Lane acquired 25-year old [[Norm Cash]] from the White Sox for [[Minnie Miñoso]] and then traded him to Detroit before he ever played a game for the Indians; Cash went on to hit over 350 home runs for the Tigers. The Indians received [[Steve Demeter]] in the deal, who would have only five at-bats for Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Dow  | first = Bill | title = Former Tiger Norm Cash  | work = Baseball Digest  | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_9_60/ai_76928886  | month = September | year = 2001 | accessdate = 2006-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Curse of Rocky Colavito====
In 1960, Lane made the trade that would define his tenure in Cleveland when he dealt slugging right fielder and fan favorite&lt;ref name=Colavito&gt;{{cite book | last =Borsvold | first = David | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Cleveland Indians: Cleveland Press Years, 1920–1982  | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | year =1960 | location = | pages =81  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=v0hgrNuScVMC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%2B%22colavito%22+%2Bfan+%2Bfavorite&amp;sig=o2lroEmq6QAgSYfTNmI777LvIQY | doi = | id = | isbn =0738523259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rocky Colavito]] to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for [[Harvey Kuenn]] just before [[Opening Day]] in {{By|1960}}.
It was a blockbuster trade that swapped the {{By|1959}} AL home run co-champion (Colavito) for the AL batting champion (Kuenn). After the trade, however, Colavito hit over 30 home runs four times and made three All-Star teams for Detroit and Kansas City before returning to Cleveland in {{By|1965}}. Kuenn, on the other hand, would play only one season for the Indians before departing for [[San Francisco Giants|San Francisco]] in a trade for an aging [[Johnny Antonelli]] and [[Willie Kirkland]]. Then ''[[Akron Beacon Journal]]'' columnist [[Terry Pluto]] documented the decades of woe that followed the trade in his book ''[[The Curse of Rocky Colavito]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Steve|last= Gietschier |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= The Curse of Rocky Colavito: A Loving Look at a Thirty-Year Slump. – book reviews |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n17_v217/ai_15355261 |format= |work= The Sporting News|publisher= |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=1994-09-25 |accessdate=2008-06-10 |language= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being attached to the curse, Colavito said that he never placed a curse on the Indians but that the trade was prompted by a salary dispute with Lane.&lt;ref name = Curse&gt;{{cite news |first= Stan|last= Grossfeld |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= Colavito Always Straight Shooter |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2007/10/12/colavito_always_straight_shooter/ |format= |work= The Boston Globe|publisher= |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2008-06-29 |language= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane even engineered a unique trade of managers in mid-season 1960, sending [[Joe Gordon]] to the Tigers in exchange for [[Jimmy Dykes]]. Lane left the team in 1961, but ill-advised trades continued. In 1965, the Indians traded pitcher [[Tommy John]], who would go on to win 288 games in his career, and 1966 Rookie of the Year [[Tommy Agee]] to the White Sox to get Colavito back.&lt;ref name = Curse/&gt;  [[Lou Piniella]], the 1969 Rookie of the Year and [[Luis Tiant]], who was selected to two All-Star Games after leaving, both left. At one point, Cleveland even traded [[Harry Chiti]] to the [[New York Mets]], only to receive him back as the player to be named later after 15 days.

The 1970s were little better, with the Indians trading away several future stars, including [[Graig Nettles]], [[Dennis Eckersley]], [[Buddy Bell]] and 1971 Rookie of the Year [[Chris Chambliss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Riess | first = Steven  | title = Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball Clubs: Volume 1 | publisher = Univ of South Carolina Press | year = 2006 | location = | pages =1067 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ZCcJVZyl5oYC | doi = | id = | isbn = 0313329931}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a number of players who made no impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 10-best Yankee Trades of All Time |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=list/bestyankeetrades |publisher=ESPN.com |date=2004-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constant ownership changes did not help the Indians. In 1963, Daley's syndicate sold the team to a group headed by general manager [[Gabe Paul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TBT&quot;/&gt;  Three years later, Paul sold the Indians to [[Vernon Stouffer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Murray Chass |title=BASEBALL; Demise and Pall Of the Indians |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D91130F931A35754C0A967958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work=New York Times |date=1991-07-02 |accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Stouffer's]] frozen-food empire. Prior to Stouffer's purchase, the team was rumored to be relocated due to poor attendance. Despite the potential for a financially strong owner, Stouffer had some non-baseball related financial setbacks and, consequently, the team was cash-poor.  In order to solve some financial problems, Stouffer had made an agreement to play a minimum of 30 home games in [[New Orleans]] with a view to a possible move there.&lt;ref name=Mileti&gt;{{cite news |author=Ron Fimrite |title=Circle The Wagons, Indian Uprising! |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1086136/index.htm |work=Sports Illustrated |date=1972-05-29 |accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After rejecting an offer from [[George Steinbrenner]] and former Indian [[Al Rosen]], Stouffer sold the team in 1972 to a group led by [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[Cleveland Barons (1937–1973)|Cleveland Barons]] owner [[Nick Mileti]].&lt;ref name=Mileti/&gt;  Steinbrenner went on to buy the New York Yankees in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | pages =352  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC&amp; | doi = | id = | isbn = 1582613761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only five years later, Mileti's group sold the team for $11 million to a syndicate headed by trucking magnate Steve O'Neill and including former general manager and owner Gabe Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Richard Goldstein |title=Gabe Paul, Ex-Yankee Official, Dies at 88 |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E5DC1F3FF93BA15757C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work=New York Times |date=1998-04-28 |accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Neill's death in 1983 led to the team going on the market once more. His son, Patrick O'Neill, did not find a buyer until real estate magnates [[Richard Jacobs|Richard]] and David Jacobs purchased the team in 1986.

The team was unable to move out of the cellar, with losing seasons between 1969 and 1975. One highlight was the acquisition of [[Gaylord Perry]] in {{By|1972}}. The Indians traded fireballer [[Sam McDowell|&quot;Sudden Sam&quot; McDowell]] for Perry, who became the first Indian pitcher to win the [[Cy Young Award]]. In {{By|1975}}, Cleveland broke another color barrier with the hiring of [[Frank Robinson]] as Major League Baseball's first [[African American]] manager.  Robinson served as player-manager and would provide a franchise highlight when he hit a [[pinch hit]] home run on [[Opening Day]]. But the high profile signing of [[Wayne Garland]], a 20-game winner in [[Baltimore Orioles|Baltimore]], proved to be a disaster after Garland suffered from shoulder problems and went 28–48 over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | title = More Tales From the Tribe Dugout | publisher = Sports Publishing, LLC | series = | year = 2005  | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=2UHG0hiDunkC&amp;  | doi = | isbn = 1582616809 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team failed to improve with Robinson as manager and he was fired in {{By|1977}}. In 1977, pitcher [[Dennis Eckersley]] threw a no-hitter against the [[California Angels]]. The next season, he would be dealt to the [[Boston Red Sox]] where he won 20 games in 1978 and another 17 in 1979.
[[Image:Indian uprising-small.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The 1987 ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' &quot;Indian Uprising&quot; cover]]
The 1970s also featured the infamous [[Ten Cent Beer Night]] at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The ill-conceived promotion at a {{Baseball Year|1974}} game against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] ended in a riot by fans and a forfeit by the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Jackson | first = Paul | title = The night beer and violence bubbled over in Cleveland | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=beernight/080604&amp;sportCat=mlb | date=2008-06-04 |accessdate = 2009-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were more bright spots in the 1980s. In May 1981, [[Len Barker]] threw a [[perfect game]] against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], joining Addie Joss as the only other Indian pitcher to do so.&lt;ref name=Barker&gt;{{cite web |author= Anthony Castrovince |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060514&amp;content_id=1453617&amp;vkey=news_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle |title=Barker's special night remains vivid |date=2006-05-15 |accessdate=2008-07-01 |work=MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joe Charboneau|&quot;Super Joe&quot; Charbonneau]] won the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|American League Rookie of the Year]] award. Unfortunately, Charboneau was out of baseball by 1983 after falling victim to back injuries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Stephen Ripley |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Golf/News/2007/07/08/4323392-sun.html |title=Missing in Action  |date=2007-07-08 |accessdate=2008-07-01 |work=Winnipeg Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Barker, who was also hampered by injuries, never became a consistently dominant starting pitcher.&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;

Eventually, the Indians traded Barker to the [[Atlanta Braves]] for [[Brett Butler (baseball)|Brett Butler]] and [[Brook Jacoby]],&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt; who would become mainstays of the team for the remainder of the decade. Butler and Jacoby were joined by [[Joe Carter]], [[Mel Hall]], [[Julio Franco]] and [[Cory Snyder]], which brought new hope to fans in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ron Fimrite  |title=Pow! Wow!| url= http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065788/index.htm |work=Sports Illustrated |date=1987-04-06 |accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a rare winning season in {{By|1986}}, [[Sports Illustrated]], with Carter and Snyder pictured on the cover, boldly predicted the Indians to win the [[American League East]] in {{By|1987}}. Instead, the team went on to lose 101 games and finish with the worst record in baseball, a fate attributed to the [[Sports Illustrated cover jinx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Bradley  | first = Mickey  | authorlink =  | coauthors = Dan Gordon | title = Haunted Baseball: Ghosts, Curses, Legends, and Eerie Events | publisher = Globe Pequot | year = 2007 | location = | pages =248–249 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=sIft7HSlDUEC  | doi = | id = | isbn = 1599210223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleveland's struggles over the 30-year span were highlighted in the 1989 film ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'', which comically depicted a hapless Cleveland ball club going from worst to first by the end of the film.

====Organizational turnaround====
Throughout the 1980s, Indians owners had pushed for a new stadium. Cleveland Stadium had been a symbol of the Indians' glory years in the 1940s and 1950s. However, during the lean years even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the cavernous environment. The old stadium was not aging gracefully; chunks of concrete were falling off in sections and the old wooden pilings now petrified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jon Morgan |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/bal-modell121795,1,3690562.story?page=1 |title=Inside the Browns deal |date=1995-12-17 |accessdate=2008-07-01 |work=Baltimore Sun, reprinted by the Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, a proposal for a $150 million domed stadium was defeated in a referendum 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E0DE1E38F933A25756C0A962948260 |title=Tax Rise and Domed Stadium Are Voted Down in Cleveland |date=05-10-1984 |accessdate=2008-07-01 |work=Associated Press, reprinted at the New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in May 1990, [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] voters passed an [[Pigovian tax|excise tax]] on sales of alcohol and cigarettes in the county. The tax proceeds would be used to finance the building of the [[Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex]] which would include [[Jacobs Field]] and [[Quicken Loans Arena|Gund Arena]] for the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] basketball team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jennifer Stoffel |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DC1F31F930A25755C0A966958260 |title=New Sports Complex for Cleveland |date=1990-06-13 |accessdate=2008-07-01 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The team had new ownership and a new stadium on the way. They now needed a winning team.

The team's fortunes started to turn in {{By|1989}}, ironically with a very unpopular trade. The team sent power-hitting outfielder [[Joe Carter]] to the [[San Diego Padres]] for two unproven players, [[Sandy Alomar, Jr.]] and [[Carlos Baerga]]. Alomar made an immediate impact, not only being elected to the [[1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star team]] but also winning Cleveland's fourth [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award and a [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]]. Baerga would become a three-time All-Star with consistent offensive production.

Indians general manager [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] made a number of moves that would finally bring success to the team. In {{By|1991}}, he hired former Indian [[Mike Hargrove]] to [[Manager (baseball)|manage]] and traded catcher [[Eddie Taubensee]] to the [[Houston Astros]] who, with a surplus of outfielders, were willing to part with [[Kenny Lofton]]. Lofton finished second in AL Rookie of the Year balloting with a .285 average and 66 [[stolen bases]].

The Indians were named &quot;Organization of the Year&quot; by Baseball America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Official Site of The Cleveland Indians: History: Indians History |url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/cle/history/cle_history_overview.jsp?story=5 |publisher=Major League Baseball, Cleveland Indians |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992, in response to the appearance of offensive bright spots and an improving [[Farm team|farm system]].

The team suffered a tragedy during [[spring training]] of {{By|1993}}, when a boat carrying pitchers [[Steve Olin]], [[Tim Crews]], and [[Bob Ojeda]] crashed into a pier. Olin and Crews were killed, and Ojeda was seriously injured. (Ojeda missed most of the season, and would retire the following year.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jayson Stark |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1527339&amp;type=columnist |title=Ten years later, the pain is still there |date=2003-03-21 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 1993 season, the team was in transition, leaving Cleveland Stadium and fielding a talented nucleus of young players. Many of those players came from the Indians' new [[AAA (baseball)|AAA]] farm team, the [[Charlotte Knights]], who won the [[International League]] title that year.

===1994–2000: A new beginning===
[[File:Progressive Field.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Progressive Field]], formerly Jacobs Field. ]]
Indians General Manager [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] and team owner [[Richard Jacobs]] managed to turn the team's fortunes around. The Indians opened [[Progressive Field|Jacobs Field]] in 1994 with the aim of improving on the prior season's sixth-place finish. The Indians were only one game behind the division-leading [[Chicago White Sox]] on August 12 when a [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|players strike]] wiped out the rest of the season. The strike also led to an absurdity: [[1994 Minnesota Twins season|The Minnesota Twins]] traded [[Dave Winfield]] to the [[1994 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] for a player to be named later just before the season was officially canceled, so no player was named. To settle the deal, the executives of the teams went out to dinner, and Cleveland picked up the tab, meaning that the future Hall-of-Famer had been dealt for dinner.&lt;ref&gt;

====1995 season: A first since 1954====
Having contended for the division in the aborted 1994 season, Cleveland sprinted to a 100–44 record (18 games were lost to player/owner negotiations) in 1995 winning its first ever divisional title. Veterans [[Dennis Martinez]], [[Orel Hershiser]] and [[Eddie Murray]] combined with a young core of players including [[Albert Belle]], [[Jim Thome]], [[Manny Ramírez]] and [[Charles Nagy]] to lead the league in team [[batting average]] as well as team [[earned run average|ERA]].

After defeating the [[Boston Red Sox]] in the [[1995 American League Division Series|Division Series]] and the [[Seattle Mariners]] in the [[1995 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], Cleveland clinched a [[World Series]] berth, for the first time since 1954. The World Series ended in disappointment with the Indians falling in six games to the [[Atlanta Braves]]. The Indians repeated as AL Central champions in {{By|1996}}, but lost to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in the [[1996 American League Division Series|Division Series]]. Notably in 1996, tickets for every home game for the Indians sold out before opening day.

====1997 season: One out away====
{{main|1997 Cleveland Indians season}}
In 1997 Cleveland started slow but finished with an 86–75 record. Taking their third consecutive AL Central title, the Indians defeated the heavily-favored [[New York Yankees]] in the [[1997 American League Division Series|Division Series]], 3–2. After defeating the Baltimore Orioles in the [[1997 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], Cleveland went on to face the [[Florida Marlins]] in the [[1997 World Series|World Series]] which featured the coldest game in World Series history. With the series tied after game six, the Indians went into the ninth inning of Game 7 with a 2–1 lead, but closer [[Jose Mesa]] allowed the Marlins to tie the game. In the eleventh inning, [[Edgar Rentería]] drove in the winning run off [[Charles Nagy]] giving the Marlins their first championship.

Cleveland became the first team to lose the World Series after carrying the lead into the bottom of the ninth inning of the seventh game. In his 2002 autobiography, Indians shortstop [[Omar Vizquel]] blamed Jose Mesa for the loss, which led to a feud between the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jayson Stark |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1521918&amp;type=columnist |title=Ten years later, the pain is still there |date=2003-03-11 |accessdate=200–02–17 |work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1998–2000====
In {{By|1998}}, the Indians made the playoffs for the fourth straight year. After defeating the wild-card Boston Red Sox three games to one in the [[1998 American League Division Series|first round of the playoffs]], Cleveland lost the [[1998 American League Championship Series|1998 ALCS]] in six games to the New York Yankees, who had come into the playoffs with 114 wins in the regular season and were the only team to win a playoff game against the Yankees that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No work Yankees |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/1998/postseason/news/1998/10/14/series_yankees/ |work=Sports Illustrated |date=1998-10-15 |accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the {{By|1999}} season, Cleveland added relief pitcher [[Ricardo Rincón]] and [[Roberto Alomar]], brother of catcher Sandy Alomar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ros|last=Newhan |title=Early Returns Favor Braves|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/29/sports/sp-48911 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1998-11-29 |accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the Central Division title for its fifth consecutive playoff appearance. The team scored 1,009 runs, becoming the first (and to date only) team since the 1950 Boston Red Sox to score more than 1,000 runs in a season. This time, Cleveland did not make it past the first round, losing the [[1999 American League Division Series|Division Series]] to the Red Sox, despite taking a two-games-to-none lead in the series. In game three, Indians starter Dave Burba went down with an injury in the 4th inning.&lt;ref name=Burba&gt;{{cite news |first=Joe|last=Lapointe |title=1999 PLAYOFFS: DIVISION SERIES; Red Sox Find Answers, Raising More Questions |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E6D91F31F933A25753C1A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work=[[New York Times]] |date=1999-10-10 |accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four pitchers, including presumed game four starter [[Jaret Wright]], surrendered nine runs in relief. Without a long reliever or emergency starter on the playoff roster, Hargrove started both [[Bartolo Colón]] and [[Charles Nagy]] in games four and five on only three days rest.&lt;ref name=Burba/&gt;  The Indians lost game four 23–7 and game five 12–8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Red Sox headed to ALCS after beating Cleveland 12–8 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/1999/postseason/division_series/al_div2/news/1999/10/11/redsox_indians_ap/ |work=CNNSI.com |date=1999-10-12 |accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four days later, Hargrove was dismissed as manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Snyder |title=Indians Journal |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC&amp;pg=PA501&amp;lpg=PA501&amp;dq |publisher=Menasha Ridge Press | year=2008 |isbn=1578603080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{By|2000}}, the Indians had a 44–42 start, but caught fire after the All Star break and went 46–30 the rest of the way to finish 90–72. The team had one of the league's best offenses that year and a defense that yielded three gold gloves. However, they ended up five games behind the [[Chicago White Sox]] in the Central division and missed the [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] by one game to the [[Seattle Mariners]]. Mid-season trades brought [[Bob Wickman]] and [[Jake Westbrook]] to Cleveland, and free agent [[Manny Ramírez]] departed for Boston after the season.

The Indians set a Major League record for most pitchers used in a single season. Colon, Burba, and [[Chuck Finley]] posted strong seasons, and the bullpen was solid. But with Jaret Wright and Charles Nagy spending months on the disabled list, the team could not solidify the final two spots in the rotation. Other starting pitchers that season combined for a total of 346⅔ innings and 265 earned runs for an ERA of 6.88.

In 2000, [[Larry Dolan]] bought the Indians for $320 million from Richard Jacobs, who, along with his late brother David, had paid $45 million for the club in 1986. The sale set a record at the time for the sale of a baseball franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cleveland Indians sold to Dolan|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/-cleveland-indians-sold-dolan/story.aspx?guid=%7B30D9D583-27E3-4DC4-88E4-46E59CB9252B%7D|work=CBS Marketwatch |date=1999-11-04 |accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001–present: The Shapiro years===
{{By|2001}} saw a return to the playoffs. After the departures of [[Manny Ramírez]] and [[Sandy Alomar, Jr.]], the Indians signed former [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] [[Juan González (baseball player)|Juan González]], who helped the Indians win the Central division with a 91–71 record.

One of the highlights of the season came on August 5, when the Indians matched the 1911 [[Detroit Tigers]] and the 1925 [[Philadelphia Athletics]] for the largest come-from-behind win in Major League Baseball history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/baseball/34123_mari06.shtml |title=Indians' comeback one for the history books |first=John |last=Hickey |date=August 6, 2001 |publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleveland rallied to overcome a 14–2 sixth inning deficit to defeat the [[Seattle Mariners]] 15–14 in 11 innings. The Mariners, who won a record 116 games that season, had a strong bullpen, and Indians manager [[Charlie Manuel]] had already pulled many of his starters with the game seemingly out of reach.

Seattle and Cleveland met in the [[2001 American League Division Series|first round of the playoffs]], with the Indians taking a two-games-to-one lead. However, with Freddy Garcia, Jamie Moyer and a strong bullpen, the Mariners won Games 4 and 5 to deny the Indians their first playoff series victory since 1998.

In the 2001 offseason, GM [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] resigned and his assistant [[Mark Shapiro]] took the reins. Shapiro moved to rebuild by dealing aging veterans for younger talent. He traded [[Roberto Alomar]] to the [[New York Mets]] for a package that included outfielder [[Matt Lawton]] and prospects [[Alex Escobar]] and [[Billy Traber]]. When the team fell out of contention in mid-{{By|2002}}, Shapiro fired manager [[Charlie Manuel]] and traded pitching ace [[Bartolo Colón]] for prospects [[Brandon Phillips]], [[Cliff Lee]], and [[Grady Sizemore]]; acquired [[Travis Hafner]] from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Rangers]] for [[Ryan Drese]] and [[Einar Diaz]]; and picked up [[Coco Crisp]] from the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] for aging starter [[Chuck Finley]]. [[Jim Thome]] left after the season, going to the Phillies for a larger contract.

Young Indians teams finished far out of contention in 2002 and {{By|2003}} under new manager [[Eric Wedge]]. They posted strong offensive numbers in {{By|2004}}, but continued to struggle with a bullpen that blew more than 20 [[save (sport)|saves]]. A highlight of the season was a 22–0 victory over the [[New York Yankees]] on August 31, one of the worst defeats suffered by the Yankees in team history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=240831110 |title=Vizquel's six hits tie AL record |accessdate=2008-06-08 |publisher=ESPN |date=2004-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early {{By|2005}}, the offense got off to a poor start. After a brief July slump, the Indians caught fire in August, and cut a 15.5 game deficit in the Central Division down to 1.5 games. However, the season came to a end as the Indians went on to lose six of their last seven games, five of them by one run, missing the playoffs by only two games.  [[2006 in baseball|The next season]], the club made several roster changes, while retaining its nucleus of young players. The off-season was highlighted by the acquisition of top prospect [[Andy Marté]] from the [[Boston Red Sox]].  The Indians had a solid offensive season, led by career years from [[Travis Hafner]] and [[Grady Sizemore]]. Hafner, despite missing the last month of the season, tied the single season [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] record of six, which was set in {{By|1987}} by [[Don Mattingly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E2DC173EF937A2575BC0A9609C8B63|title=BASEBALL; Hafner's 6th Grand Slam Ties Mattingly |date=2006-08-14|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the solid offensive performance, the bullpen struggled with 23 blown [[Save (baseball)|saves]] (a Major League worst), and the Indians finished a disappointing fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/mlb031/11405274/detail.html|title=Cleveland Indians 2007 Preview|last=Ruddick|first=Chris|date=2007-03-27|publisher=News Net 5|accessdate=2009-03-21}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:We Win!.jpg|thumb|right|Indians fans celebrate as the team clinches the 2007 division title]]
In {{By|2007}}, Shapiro signed veteran help for the bullpen and outfield in the offseason. Veterans [[Aaron Fultz]], and [[Joe Borowski (baseball)|Joe Borowski]] joined [[Rafael Betancourt]] in the Indians bullpen.&lt;ref name=&quot;MLB2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070328&amp;content_id=1864413&amp;vkey=news_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle|title=Indians Opening Day outlook|last=Castrovince|first=Anthony |date=2007-03-30|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro also signed right fielder [[Trot Nixon]] and left fielder [[David Dellucci]] to short-term contracts for veteran leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;MLB2007&quot;/&gt; The Indians improved significantly over the prior year and went into the All-Star break in second place. The team brought back [[Kenny Lofton]] for his third stint with the team in late July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2007/columns/story?columnist=crasnick_jerry&amp;id=3049840|title=Lofton keeps on ticking, delivers huge performance for Indians|last=Crasnick|first=Jerry|date=2007-10-04|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indians finished with a 96–66 record tied with the Red Sox for best in baseball, their seventh Central Division title in 13 years and their first post-season trip since 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/11/AR2007101102506_pf.html|title=Boston Red Sox vs. Cleveland Indians|date=2007-10-12|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indians began their playoff run by defeating the New York Yankees in the [[2007 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] three games to one. This series will be most remembered for the swarm of bugs that overtook the field in the later innings of game 2. They also jumped out to a three-games-to-one lead over the Red Sox in the [[2007 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]]. The season ended in disappointment when Boston swept the final three games to advance to the [[2007 World Series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WP2007&quot;/&gt;

Despite the loss, Cleveland players took home a number of awards. [[Grady Sizemore]], who had a .995 [[fielding percentage]] and only two errors in 405 chances, won the [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove award]], Cleveland's first since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071106&amp;content_id=2293684&amp;vkey=news_cle&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cle|title=Sizemore earns first Gold Glove Award|last=Castrovince|first=Anthony|date=2007-11-06|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indians Pitcher [[CC Sabathia]] won the second [[Cy Young Award]] in team history with a 19–7 record, a 3.21 ERA and an MLB-leading 241 [[innings pitched]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3108321|title=Sabathia only second Indians pitcher to win Cy Young|date=2007-11-14|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Wedge]] was awarded the first [[Manager of the Year Award]] in team history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/story/2007/11/14/baseball-managers.html?ref=rss|title=Wedge, Melvin voted baseball's top managers|date=2007-11-14|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indians struggled during the 2008 season.  Injuries to sluggers [[Travis Hafner]] and [[Victor Martinez (baseball)|Victor Martinez]], as well as starting pitchers [[Jake Westbrook]] and [[Fausto Carmona]] led to a poor start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/indians/2008-12-23-indiansreport_N.htm|title=Indians have closer in fold, but infield in flux|last=Antonen|first=Mel|date=2008-12-25|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Indians, falling to last place for a short time in June and July, traded [[CC Sabathia]] to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/08/sports/baseball/08brewers.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/B/Baseball|title=Looking to Postseason, Brewers Trade for Sabathia |last=Curry|first=Jack|date=2008-07-08|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, amid the mediocrity, some key players, such as shortstop [[Jhonny Peralta]] and catcher [[Kelly Shoppach]], who took over starting duties after Martinez was injured, began to shine.

===Season-by-season results===
{{main|List of Cleveland Indians seasons}}

==Rivalries==
===Cincinnati Reds===
{{Main|Ohio Cup}}

The '''Ohio Cup''' was an annual [[spring training|pre-season]] [[baseball]] game, which pitted the [[Ohio]] rivals Cleveland Indians and [[Cincinnati Reds]].

In its first series it was a single-game cup, played each year at minor-league [[Cooper Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], was staged just days before the start of each new [[Major League Baseball]] season. A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, in 1989 to 1996, with the Indians winning six of them. It stopped because [[interleague play]] started in 1997. The winner of the game each year was awarded the Ohio Cup in postgame ceremonies. The Ohio Cup was a favorite among baseball fans in Columbus, with attendances regularly topping 15,000.

In 1997 and  after, the two teams competed annually in the regular-season Battle of Ohio or Buckeye Series.  In 2008 the Ohio Cup restarted.

The Reds currently lead the interleague series 35&amp;ndash;34.  &lt;!-- through 2010 season --&gt;

:''See also: [[Major League Baseball#MLB uniforms]] (including image of baseball-cap logos of the 30 MLB franchises)''
The Indians' home uniform is white with navy piping around the neck and down either side of the buttons on the front of the jersey; the navy piping is also located around each sleeve.

==Fan support==
===Sellout streak===
Between June 12, 1995 and April 4, 2001, the Indians sold out 455 consecutive home games, drawing a total of 19,324,248 fans to [[Progressive Field|Jacobs Field]]. The demand for tickets was so great that all 81 home games were sold out before [[Opening Day]] on at least three separate occasions. The sellout streak set a Major League Baseball record; this was broken by the [[Boston Red Sox]] on September 8, 2008, though Boston's [[Fenway Park]] is considerably smaller than Progressive Field. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20080908&amp;content_id=3440276&amp;vkey=pr_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos |title=Red Sox fans break MLB record for most consecutive sellouts |accessdate=February 9, 2009 |date=September 8, 2008 |publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team's success during the late 1990s would even lead comedian and Cleveland native [[Drew Carey]] to quip, &quot;Finally it's your team that sucks!&quot;&lt;ref name=Pluto&gt;{{cite book

==Nickname and logo controversy==
{{further|[[Native American mascot controversy]]}}
The club nickname and its cartoon logo [[Native American mascot controversy|have been criticized]] for perpetuating Native American stereotypes. In 1997, during the team's most recent [[1997 World Series|World Series]] appearance, three [[Native Americans in the United States|Native]] protesters were arrested, but later acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/verdicts/bellecourt.html|title=Court TV Verdicts: Ohio v. Bellecourt|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio and TV==
{{main|List of Cleveland Indians broadcasters}}
The Indians' flagship radio station is [[WTAM]] AM 1100.&lt;ref name=radio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/cle/schedule/radio_affiliates.jsp |title= Radio Affiliates |work=Clevelandindians.com |accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Hamilton (broadcaster)|Tom Hamilton]] and [[Mike Hegan]] are the  primary radio announcers,&lt;ref name=broadcasters&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/team/broadcasters.jsp?c_id=cle |title= Broadcaster |work=Clevelandindians.com |accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Jim Rosenhaus (pregame host, producer/engineer) also calling an inning of each game. For the 2011 season, it was announced that Hegan would be working a reduced schedule, doing only home games and road games in nearby cities. When Hegan is off, Rosenhaus will work the full game with Hamilton.  Select games can be heard on [[WMMS]] FM 100.7 when there is a conflict with [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] basketball games, which also air on WTAM. If the Cavaliers are in the playoffs, all conflicted Indians games go to WMMS.  WMMS will also air [[Spring training]] games if there's a conflict with the Cavaliers on WTAM.

The television rights are held by [[SportsTime Ohio]] (STO), a network launched in {{By|2006}} by the Indians. [[Matt Underwood]] and former Indians [[Gold Glove]] winning CF [[Rick Manning]] form the announcing team,&lt;ref name=broadcasters/&gt;  with [[Al Pawlowski]] as the pregame and postgame host, and update anchor during the game. Former Indians LHP [[Jason Stanford]] was added to the pregame show in 2011 as an analyst.  Palowski also calls about 10–12 games per year to allow Underwood to take time off, and WKYC weekend sports anchor Dave Chudowsky then fills Palowski's role.  For the 2011 season, former Indians 1B and manager, and current special advisor [[Mike Hargrove]] will work select TV games as an analyst to allow Manning some time off.  Beinning in 2011, STO's Katie Witham will serve as field reporter during home games. Twenty games a year are shown on free TV, originating on [[WKYC]] channel 3 ([[NBC]]), (STO also airs the WKYC games via simulcast).

Past Indians broadcasters include [[Tom Manning]], [[Jack Graney]] (the first ex-baseball player to become a play-by-play announcer), [[Jack Corrigan (radio)|Jack Corrigan]] (now with the Colorado Rockies), [[Jimmy Dudley]] who received the [[Ford Frick Award]] in 1997, [[Ken Coleman]], [[Joe Castiglione]], [[Van Patrick]], [[Joe Tait]], [[Bruce Drennan]], [[Mudcat Grant|Jim &quot;Mudcat&quot; Grant]], [[Harry Jones (journalist)|Harry Jones]], [[Rocky Colavito]] and [[Herb Score]], who called Indians' baseball for 34 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Dolgan |title=Former Indians broadcaster Herb Score dies at age 75 | url=http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2008/11/former_indians_broadcaster_her.html |work=Cleveland Plain Dealer |date=2008-11-11 |accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cape Town''' ({{lang-af|Kaapstad}}; {{lang-xh|iKapa}}) is the second-most populous city in South Africa,&lt;ref name=&quot;S.Afr. CS 2007&quot;/&gt; and the largest in land area, forming part of the [[City of Cape Town]] [[metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|metropolitan municipality]]. It is the provincial capital and [[primate city]] of the [[Western Cape]], as well as the [[legislature|legislative]] capital of South Africa, where the [[Parliament of South Africa|National Parliament]] and many government offices are located. The city is famous for [[Port of Cape Town|its harbour]] as well as its natural setting in the [[Cape floral kingdom]], including such well-known landmarks as [[Table Mountain]] and [[Cape Point]]. Cape Town is also Africa's most popular tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatcapetown.com/why-cape-town.html|title=Why Cape Town is one of the Best Tourist and Expat Destinations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located on the shore of [[Table Bay]], Cape Town was originally developed by the [[Dutch East India Company]] as a victualling (supply) station for Dutch ships sailing to Eastern Africa, India, and the Far East. [[Jan van Riebeeck]]'s arrival on 6 April 1652 established the first permanent European settlement in South Africa. Cape Town quickly outgrew its original purpose as the first European outpost at the [[Castle of Good Hope]], becoming the economic and cultural hub of the [[Cape Colony]]. Until the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] and the development of [[Johannesburg]], Cape Town was the largest city in South Africa.

Today it is one of the most multicultural cities in the world, reflecting its role as a major destination for immigrants and [[expatriates]] to South Africa.
{{As of|2007}} the city had an estimated population of 3.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;S.Afr. CS 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/Publications/P03011/P030112007.pdf |publisher=Statistics South Africa |title=Community Survey, 2007: Basic Results Municipalities |format=PDF |accessdate=23 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cape Town's land area of {{convert|2455|km2|sqmi}} is larger than other South African cities, resulting in a comparatively lower population density of {{convert|1425|PD/sqkm|PD/sqmi}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;S.Afr.

{{Main|History of Cape Town}}
[[File:Charles Bell - Jan van Riebeeck se aankoms aan die Kaap.jpg|thumb|left|A painting of the arrival of [[Jan van Riebeeck]] in [[Table Bay]] (by [[Charles Davidson Bell|Charles Bell]])]]
There is no certainty as to when humans first occupied the area prior to the first visits of Europeans in the 15th century. The earliest known remnants in the region were found at Peers cave in [[Fish Hoek]] and date to between 15,000 and 12,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquityofman.com/Peers_Cave.html|title=The Antiquity of man|publisher=SouthAfrica.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of the history of the region's first residents, since there is no written history from the area before it was first mentioned by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Age of Discovery|explorer]] [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1486. [[Vasco da Gama]] recorded a sighting of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1497. In the late 16th century, Portuguese, French, Danish, Dutch and English ships regularly stopped over in Table Bay en route to the Indies. They traded tobacco, copper and iron with the [[Khoikhoi]] in exchange for fresh meat. In 1652, [[Jan van Riebeeck]] and other employees of the [[Dutch East India Company]] ({{lang-nl|Verenigde Oost-indische Compagnie}}, VOC) were sent to the Cape to establish a way-station for ships travelling to the [[Dutch East Indies]], and the [[Fort de Goede Hoop]] (later replaced by the [[Castle of Good Hope]]). The settlement grew slowly during this period, as it was hard to find adequate labour. This labour shortage prompted the authorities to import slaves from [[Indonesia]] and [[Madagascar]]. Many of these became ancestors of the first [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za/2009/05/01/coloured-people-of-the-western-cape-have-the-most-diverse-ancestry-in-the-world/ |title=Cape-Slavery-Heritage &quot; Coloured People of the Western Cape have the most Diverse Ancestry in the World :: iBlog |publisher=Cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za |date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/slavery/slavery.htm |title=Slavery and early colonisation , South African History Online |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |date=22 September 1927 |accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]]ary and [[Napoleonic]] wars, the Netherlands was repeatedly occupied by France, and Great Britain moved to take control of Dutch colonies. Britain captured Cape Town in 1795, but the Cape was returned to the Netherlands by treaty in 1803. British forces occupied the Cape again in 1806 following the battle of [[Bloubergstrand, Cape Town|Bloubergstrand]]. In the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], Cape Town was permanently ceded to Britain. It became the capital of the newly formed [[Cape Colony]], whose territory expanded very substantially through the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; 

The discovery of diamonds in [[Griqualand West]] in 1867, and the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] in 1886, prompted a flood of immigrants to South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Conflicts between the [[Boer]] republics in the interior and the British colonial government resulted in the [[Second Boer War]] of 1899–1902, which Britain won. In 1910, Britain established the [[Union of South Africa]], which unified the Cape Colony with the two defeated Boer Republics and the British [[colony of Natal]]. Cape Town became the legislative capital of the Union, and later of the [[Republic of South Africa]].

In the 1948 national elections, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] won on a platform of ''[[apartheid]]'' (racial segregation) under the slogan of &quot;[[swart gevaar]]&quot;. This led to the [[Group Areas Act]], which classified all areas according to race. Formerly multi-racial suburbs of Cape Town were either purged of unlawful residents or demolished. The most infamous example of this in Cape Town was [[District Six, Cape Town|District Six]]. After it was declared a whites-only region in 1965, all housing there was demolished and over 60,000 residents were forcibly removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/history/districtsix.htm|publisher=SouthAfrica.info|title=Recalling District Six|date=19 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these residents were relocated to the [[Cape Flats]] and Lavender Hill. Under apartheid, the Cape was considered a &quot;[[Coloured]] labour preference area&quot;, to the exclusion of &quot;[[Bantu-speaking peoples of South Africa|Bantus]]&quot;, i.e. blacks.

Cape Town was home to many leaders of the anti-apartheid movement. On [[Robben Island]], a former penitentiary island 10-kilometres from the city, many famous political prisoners were held for years. In one of the most famous moments marking the end of apartheid, [[Nelson Mandela]] made his first public speech in decades on 11 February 1990 from the balcony of [[Cape Town City Hall]] hours after being released. His speech heralded the beginning of a new era for the country, and the first [[South African general election, 1994|democratic election]] was held four years later, on 27 April 1994. Nobel Square in the [[Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront]] features statues of South Africa's four [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winners – [[Albert Luthuli]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[F. W. de Klerk]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]. Since 1994, the city has struggled with problems such as HIV/AIDS, [[tuberculosis]], a surge in violent [[drug-related crime]] and more recent xenophobic violence.&lt;!--, which has given the city a reputation for having one of the highest [[homicide]] rates in the world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}--&gt; At the same time, the economy has surged to unprecedented levels due to the boom in the tourism and the real estate industries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

[[File:Satellite image of Cape peninsula.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Landsat]] image of Cape Town overlaid on [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission|SRTM]] elevation data. Elevation is exaggerated by a factor of two.]]
The centre of Cape Town is located at the northern end of the [[Cape Peninsula]]. [[Table Mountain]] forms a dramatic backdrop to the [[City Bowl]], with its plateau over {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} high; it is surrounded by near-vertical cliffs, [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] and [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]]. Sometimes a thin strip of cloud forms over the mountain, and owing to its appearance, it is colloquially known as the &quot;tablecloth&quot;. The peninsula consists of a dramatic mountainous spine jutting southwards into the Atlantic Ocean, ending at [[Cape Point]]. There are over 70 peaks above {{Convert|1000|ft|m}} (the American definition of a mountain) within Cape Town's official city limits. Many of the suburbs of Cape Town are on the large plain of the [[Cape Flats]], which joins the peninsula to the mainland. The Cape Flats lie on what is known as a rising marine plain, consisting mostly of sandy geology which shows that at one point Table Mountain itself was an island.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape Peninsula]] has a [[Subtropical]] [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Koppen]] ''Csb''), with mild, wet winters, and dry and very warm summers. In winter time, which lasts from the beginning of June to end of August, large cold fronts come across from the Atlantic Ocean with heavy [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and strong north-westerly winds. The winter months are cool, with an average minimum of {{convert|7.0|C|0}} and maximum of {{convert|17.5|C|0}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;WMO&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldweather.org/035/c00138.htm
|title=World Weather Information Service – Cape Town
|accessdate= 4 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the city's annual rainfall occurs in wintertime, but due to the mountainous topography of the city, rainfall amounts for specific areas can vary dramatically. [[Newlands, Cape Town|Newlands]], to the south of the city, is the wettest suburb in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1stweather.com/regional/climate/index_climate.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The valleys and coastal plains average {{convert|515|mm|in|1}} of rain per annum, while mountain areas can average as much as {{convert|1500|mm|in|0}} per annum.

Summer, which lasts from November to March, is warm and dry. The Peninsula gets frequent strong winds from the south-east, known locally as the [[Cape Doctor]], because it blows away pollution and cleans the air. The south-easterly wind is caused by a [[Pressure system#High-pressure system|high-pressure system]] which sits in the [[South Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]] to the west of Cape Town, known as the South-Atlantic High. Summer temperatures are mild, with an average maximum of {{convert|26.5|°C|0}}. Cape Town can be uncomfortably hot when the Berg Wind, meaning &quot;mountain wind&quot; blows from the [[Karoo]] interior for a couple of weeks in February or early March.

Water temperatures range greatly, between {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}} on the Atlantic Seaboard, to {{convert|22|°C|0|abbr=on}} in False Bay. Average annual Ocean temperatures are between {{convert|13|°C|0|abbr=on}} on the Atlantic Seaboard (similar to Californian waters, such as [[San Francisco]] or [[Big Sur]]), and {{convert|17|°C|0|abbr=on}} in False Bay (similar to Northern Mediterranean temperatures, such as [[Nice]] or [[Monte Carlo]]).

=== Flora and fauna ===
{{Main|Biodiversity of Cape Town}}
Located in a [[Conservation International|CI]] [[Biodiversity hotspot]] as well as the unique [[Cape Floristic Region]], the city of Cape Town has one of the highest levels of [[biodiversity]] of any equivalent area in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Pages/BrochuresBooklets.aspx
|title=Environmental resources and downloads. City of Cape Town. Environmental Resource Management Dept}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is home to a total of 19 different [[phytochorion|vegetation types]], of which several are completely [[Endemism|endemic]] to the city and occur nowhere else in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/stats/Documents/Vegetation%20Types.mht|title=Cape Town. List of Vegetation Types}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also the only habitat of hundreds of [[Endemism|endemic]] species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Documents/Biodiv_fact_sheet_suppl_Endemic_spp_list_2010-03.pdf|title=Endemic Species of the city of Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hundreds of others which are severely restricted or threatened. This enormous species diversity is mainly because the city is uniquely located at the convergence point of several different soil types and micro-climates.

An often quoted fact is that there are more indigenous plant species just on [[Table Mountain]] than there are in the whole of the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Rebelo, C. Boucher, N. Helme, L. Mucina, M.C. Rutherford et al. 2006. Fynbos Biome, in: L. Mucina &amp; M.C. Rutherford (eds). ''The Vegetation of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Documents/Biodiv_fact_sheet_2_PenSandFyn_2010-03.pdf ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Documents/Biodiv_fact_sheet_7_endemic_species_2010-06.pdf ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, rapid [[population growth]] and [[Urbanisation|urban sprawl]] has covered much of these ecosystems with development. Consequently Cape Town now has over 300 [[threatened]] plant species and 13 which are now [[extinct]]. In fact, the [[Cape Peninsula]], which lies entirely within the city of Cape Town, has the highest concentration of [[threatened species]] of any continental area of equivalent size in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://perceval.bio.nau.edu/downloads/grail/climate_seminar/section2/Hannah_etal05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Tiny remnants of [[critically endangered]] or [[Extinct|near extinct]] plants often survive on road sides, pavements and sports fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Documents/Biodiv_fact_sheet_8_threatened_species_2010-03.pdf ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The remaining ecosystems are partially protected through a system of over 30 [[List of nature reserves in Cape Town|nature reserves]] – including the massive [[Table Mountain National Park]].

[[File:Simonstown.jpg|thumb|right|The historical centre of Simon's Town]]
The South Peninsula is generally regarded as the area south of [[Muizenberg, Cape Town|Muizenberg]] on the Indian Ocean and [[Noordhoek, Cape Town|Noordhoek]] on the Atlantic Ocean, all the way to [[Cape Point]]. Until recently quite rural, the population of the area is growing quickly as new coastal developments proliferate and larger plots are subdivided to provide more compact housing.

=== Cape Flats ===
{{Main|Cape Flats}}
The Cape Flats is an expansive, low-lying, flat area situated to the southeast of the central business district of Cape Town. To most people in Cape Town, the area is known simply as 'The Flats'.

Described by some as '[[apartheid]]'s dumping ground', from the 1950s the area became home to people the [[apartheid]] government designated as non-White. Race-based legislation such as the [[Group Areas Act]] and [[pass laws]] either forced non-white people out of more central urban areas designated for white people and into government-built townships in the Flats, or made living in the area illegal, forcing many people designated as [[Black people#South Africa|Black]] into informal settlements elsewhere in the Flats. The Flats have since then been home to much of the population of Greater Cape Town.

=== West Coast ===
The West Coast suburbs of Cape Town include [[Bloubergstrand, Cape Town|Bloubergstrand]], [[Milnerton, Cape Town|Milnerton]], [[Tableview, Cape Town|Tableview]], [[West Beach, Cape Town|West Beach]], Atlantis, Melkbosstrand, Big Bay, Sunset Beach, Sunningdale and Parklands.

== Government ==
[[File:CapeTownCityHall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cape Town City Hall]].]]
{{Main|City of Cape Town}}
Cape Town's local government is the [[City of Cape Town]], which is a [[metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|metropolitan municipality]]. Cape Town is governed by a 221-member [[city council]]. The city is divided into 111 electoral wards; each ward directly elects one member of the council, whilst the other 110 councillors are elected by a system of [[party-list proportional representation]]. The [[Mayor of Cape Town|Executive Mayor]] and Executive Deputy Mayor are chosen by the city council.

In the [[South African municipal election, 2011|most recent local government elections]], the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA) won an outright majority, taking 135 of the 221 council seats. The [[African National Congress]], the national ruling party, received 73 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.za/content/LGEPublicReports/197/Seat%20Calculation%20Detail/WP/CPT.pdf |title=Seat Calculation Detail: City of Cape Town |publisher=Independent Electoral Commission |date=21 May 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Executive Mayor [[Helen Zille]] of the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] resigned on 29 April 2009 as a result of her election to the [[Western Cape Provincial Parliament]] and subsequent election as Premier of the Western Cape Province. The City Council elected [[Dan Plato]] (DA) as the new Executive Mayor and [[Ian Neilson]] (DA) as the new Executive Deputy Mayor. The DA's candidate in the 2011 elections, and therefore the Mayor-elect, is [[Patricia de Lille]].

[[File:Cape Town CBD.jpg|thumb|right|Cape Town foreshore area with the ABSA Bank building in the background.]]
[[File:Cape Town International Convention Centre.jpg|thumb|right|The main entrance to the [[Cape Town International Convention Centre]]]]
Cape Town is the economic centre of the Western Cape Province, South Africa's second main economic centre and Africa's third main economic hub city. It serves as the regional manufacturing centre in the Western Cape. It also has the primary harbour and airport in the province. The large government presence in the city – both as the capital of the Western Cape and the seat of the [[Parliament of South Africa|National Parliament]] – has led to increased revenue and growth in industries that serve the government. Cape Town hosts many [[meeting|conferences]], particularly in the recently expanded [[Cape Town International Convention Centre]], which opened in June 2003 and is due for another expansion within the next year.

Cape Town has recently enjoyed a booming real estate and construction market, because of the 2010 World Cup as well as many people buying summer homes in the city or relocating there permanently. Cape Town hosted 9 World Cup matches: Six 1st round matches, one second round, one quarter final and a semifinal. The central business district is under an extensive urban renewal programme, with numerous new buildings and renovations taking place under the guidance of the [[Cape Town Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/econstats/econrep.asp|title=City of Cape Town: Economic Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cape Town has four major commercial nodes, with Cape Town Central Business District containing the majority of job opportunities and office space. [[Century City (Cape Town)|Century City]], the [[Bellville, Western Cape|Bellville]]/TygerValley strip and [[Claremont, Cape Town|Claremont]] commercial nodes are well established and contain many offices and corporate headquarters as well. Most companies headquartered in the city are insurance companies, retail groups, publishers, design houses, fashion designers, shipping companies, petrochemical companies, architects and advertising agencies.

Much of the produce is handled through the [[Port of Cape Town]] or [[Cape Town International Airport]]. Most major shipbuilding companies have offices and manufacturing locations in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southafricanboatbuilders.co.za|title=South African Boatbuilders Business Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Province is also a centre of energy development for the country, with the existing [[Koeberg nuclear power station]] providing energy for the Western Cape's needs. Recently, oil explorers have discovered [[crude oil|oil]] and natural gas off the coast in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dme.gov.za|title=South African Department of Minerals and Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western Cape is an important tourist region in South Africa; the tourism industry accounts for 9.8% of the GDP of the province and employs 9.6% of the province's workforce. In 2004, over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million international tourists visited the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.capegateway.gov.za/Text/2005/12/dmo_annualreport_20042005.pdf|publisher=Cape Town Routes Unlimited|title=Annual Report 2004/2005|isbn=0-621-35496-1|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the highest number of successful Information Technology companies in Africa, Cape Town is an important centre for the industry on the continent. Growing at an annual rate of 8.5% and an estimated worth of R77&amp;nbsp;billion in 2010 nationwide the IT industry in Cape Town is becoming increasingly important to the city's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capegateway.gov.za/eng/pubs/news/2007/mar/154622|title=Cape Town Leads In Information Technology|date=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mining industry in Cape Town has been booming for the last 6 years. 6000 miners are now employed in the mining industry since 2002. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The city was recently named as the most entrepreneurial city in South Africa, with the percentage of Capetonians pursuing business opportunities almost three times higher than the national average. Those aged between 18–64 were 190% more likely to pursue new business, whilst in Johannesburg, the same demographic group was only 60% more likely than the national average to pursue a new business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&amp;ArticleID=1518-1786_2389511|title=Cape Town breeds entrepreneurs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kirstenbosch - View from the Botanical Gardens.jpg|thumb|[[Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden]]]]
Cape Town is not only the most popular international tourist destination in South Africa, but Africa as a whole. This is due to its good climate, natural setting, and well-developed infrastructure. The city has several well-known natural features that attract tourists, most notably [[Table Mountain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecape.org/|title=Table Mountain Aerial Cableway}}&lt;/ref&gt; which forms a large part of the [[Table Mountain National Park]] and is the back end of the [[City Bowl, Cape Town|City Bowl]]. Reaching the top of the mountain can be achieved either by hiking up, or by taking the [[Table Mountain Cableway]]. [[Cape Point]] is recognised as the dramatic headland at the end of the [[Cape Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capepoint.co.za/|title=Cape Point, South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many tourists also drive along [[Chapman's Peak|Chapman's Peak Drive]], a narrow road that links [[Noordhoek, Cape Town|Noordhoek]] with [[Hout Bay, Cape Town|Hout Bay]], for the views of the Atlantic Ocean and nearby mountains. It is possible to either drive or hike up [[Signal Hill (Cape Town)|Signal Hill]] for closer views of the City Bowl and Table Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbi.ac.za/frames/kirstfram.htm|title=Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many tourists also visit [[List of beaches of Cape Town|Cape Town's beaches]], which are popular with local residents.&lt;ref name='CTbeaches'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safarinow.com/cms/cape-town-beaches/irie.aspx|title=Cape Town Beaches|publisher=SafariNow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the city's unique geography, it is possible to visit several different beaches in the same day, each with a different setting and atmosphere. Though the Cape's water ranges from cold to mild, the difference between the two sides of the city is dramatic. While the Atlantic Seaboard averages annual water temperatures barely above that of coastal California around {{convert|13|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, the False Bay coast is very much warmer, averaging between {{convert|16|and|17|C|F}} annually. This is similar to water temperatures in much of the Northern [[Mediterranean]] (for example [[Nice]]). In Summer, False bay water averages slightly over {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|22|°C|°F|abbr=on}} a common high. Beaches located on the Atlantic Coast tend to have very cold water due to the [[Benguela current]] which originates from the [[Southern Ocean]], whilst the water at [[False Bay]] beaches may be warmer by up to {{convert|10|C-change|0}} at the same moment due to the influence of the warm [[Agulhas Current|Agulhas current]], and the surface warming effects of the South Easter wind.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTbeaches&quot;/&gt;

Both coasts are equally popular, although the beaches in affluent [[Clifton, Cape Town|Clifton]] and elsewhere on the Atlantic Coast are better developed with restaurants and cafés, with a particularly vibrant strip of restaurants and bars accessible to the beach at [[Camps Bay]]. [[Boulders Beach]] near Simon's Town is known for its colony of [[African Penguin|African penguins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonstown.com/tourism/penguins/penguins.htm|title=The African Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Surfing]] is popular and the city hosts the [[Red Bull Big Wave Africa]] surfing competition every year.

The city has several notable cultural attractions. The [[Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront]], built on top of part of the [[dock (maritime)|docks]] of the [[Port of Cape Town]], is the city's most visited tourist attraction. It is also one of the city's most popular shopping venues, with several hundred shops and the [[Two Oceans Aquarium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterfront.co.za/|title=The Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquarium.co.za/|title=The Two Oceans Aquarium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the charm of the V&amp;A, as it is locally known, is that the Port continues to operate and visitors can watch ships enter and leave. The V&amp;A also hosts the Nelson Mandela Gateway, through which [[ferry|ferries]] depart for [[Robben Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robben-island.org.za|title=Robben Island}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to take a ferry from the V&amp;A to [[Hout Bay, Cape Town|Hout Bay]], [[Simon's Town, Cape Town|Simon's Town]] and the [[Cape Fur Seal]] colonies on Seal and Duiker Islands. Several companies offer tours of the [[Cape Flats]], a mostly Coloured [[Township (South Africa)|township]], and [[Khayelitsha]], a mostly black township. An option is to sleep overnight in Cape Town's townships. There are several B&amp;Bs where you can spend a safe and real African night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetownmagazine.com/todonight/Western-Cape/Townships/Township-BaBs-Discover-what-true-African-hospitality-is-all-about~11|title=Township stays}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cape Town is noted for its architectural heritage, with the highest density of [[Cape Dutch architecture|Cape Dutch]] style buildings in the world. Cape Dutch style, which combines the architectural traditions of the Netherlands, Germany, France and Indonesia, is most visible in [[Constantia, Cape Town|Constantia]], the old government buildings in the Central Business District, and along [[Long Street (Cape Town)|Long Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encounter.co.za/article/19.html|title=Cape Dutch Architecture|publisher=Encounter South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Comparative Evaluation of Urbanism in Cape Town|publisher=University of Cape Town Press|year=1977|pages=20–98|isbn=0-620-02535-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual [[Coon Carnival|Cape Town Minstrel Carnival]], also known by its [[Afrikaans]] name of ''Kaapse Klopse'', is a large [[minstrel]] festival held annually on 2 January or ''&quot;Tweede Nuwe Jaar&quot;'' (Afrikaans: Second New Year). Competing teams of minstrels parade in brightly coloured costumes, either carrying colourful umbrellas or playing an array of musical instruments.

Cape Town's most popular sports by participation are [[cricket]], association football, swimming, and [[rugby union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Time Out: Cape Town|publisher=Time Out Publishing|year=2006|pages=127–130: Sports|isbn=1-904978-12-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rugby union, Cape Town is the home of the [[Western Province (rugby)|Western Province]] side, who play at [[Newlands Stadium]] and compete in the [[Currie Cup]]. In addition, Western Province players (along with some from Wellington's [[Boland Cavaliers]]) comprise the [[Stormers]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]'s [[Super Rugby]] competition. Cape Town also regularly hosts the national team, the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]], and hosted matches during the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]], including the opening ceremony and game, as well as the [[All Blacks]] versus England semi-final that saw [[Jonah Lomu]] run in four tries.

Association football, which is better known as ''soccer'' in South Africa, is also popular. Three [[Football club|clubs]] from Cape Town play in the [[Premier Soccer League]] (PSL), South Africa's premier league. These teams are [[Ajax Cape Town]], which formed as a result of the 1999 amalgamation of the [[Seven Stars (South African Soccer Club)|Seven Stars]] and the [[Cape Town Spurs]], [[Santos Football Club (South Africa)|Santos]] and newly-promoted [[Vasco da Gama (South Africa)|Vasco da Gama]]. Cape Town was also the location of several of the matches of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|FIFA 2010 World Cup]] including a semi-final,&lt;ref name=southafrica.info&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/2010/2010-faq.htm|title=SA 2010: frequent questions|publisher=southafrica.info|accessdate=26 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; held in South Africa. The Mother City built a new 70,000 seat stadium ([[Green Point Stadium]]) in the Green Point area.

In cricket, the [[Cape Cobras]] represent Cape Town at the [[Newlands Cricket Ground]]. The team is the result of an amalgamation of the [[Western Province Cricket]] and [[Boland Cricket]] teams. They take part in the [[Supersport Series|Supersport]] and [[Standard Bank Cup Series]]. The Newlands Cricket Ground regularly hosts international matches.

Cape Town has Olympic aspirations: in 1996, Cape Town was one of the five candidate cities shortlisted by the [[IOC]] to launch official candidatures to host the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. Although the games ultimately went to [[Athens]], Cape Town came in third place. There has been some speculation that Cape Town is seeking the South African Olympic Committee's nomination to be South Africa's bid city for the [[2020 Summer Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=5&amp;id=1049905279 South Africa Announces Bid For 2020 Summer Olympic Games], Gamesbids.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports events ===
{{See|List of sports events in Cape Town}}
The city of Cape Town has vast experience in hosting major national and international sports events.

The [[Cape Argus Pick 'n Pay Cycle Tour]] is the world's largest individually timed cycle race{{ndash}} and the first event outside Europe to be included in the International Cycling Union's Golden Bike Series. It sees over 35 000 cyclists tackling a 109&amp;nbsp;km route around Cape Town. The [[Absa Cape Epic]] is the largest full-service mountain bike stage race in the world.

Some notable events hosted by Cape Town have included the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]], [[2003 ICC Cricket World Cup]], and World Championships in various sports such as athletics, fencing, weightlifting, hockey, cycling, canoeing, gymnastics and others.

Cape Town was also a host city to the 2010 FIFA World Cup from 11 June to 11 July 2010, further enhancing its profile as a major events city. It was also one of the host cities of the [[2009 Indian Premier League]] cricket tournament.

== Education ==
Public primary and secondary schools in Cape Town are run by the [[Western Cape Education Department]]. This provincial department is divided into seven districts; four of these are &quot;Metropole&quot; districts{{ndash}} Metropole Central, North, South, and East{{ndash}} which cover various areas of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wced.wcape.gov.za/operations/emdc_links.html |title=Education Management and Development Centres (EMDCs) |accessdate=10 April 2008 |publisher=Western Cape Education Department |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080409162520/http://wced.wcape.gov.za/operations/emdc_links.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many private schools, both religious and secular, in Cape Town.

=== Tertiary education ===
[[File:UCT Upper Campus landscape view.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[University of Cape Town]]'s main campus]]
Cape Town has a well-developed higher system of [[public university|public universities]]. Cape Town is served by three public universities: the [[University of Cape Town]] (UCT), the [[University of the Western Cape]] (UWC) and the [[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]] (CPUT). [[Stellenbosch University]], while not in the city itself, is 50-kilometres from the City Bowl and has additional campuses, such as the Tygerberg Faculty of Health Sciences and the Bellville Business Park closer to the City.

Both the University of Cape Town and Stellenbosch University are leading universities in South Africa. This is due in large part to substantial financial contributions made to these institutions by both the public and private sector. UCT is an English speaking institution. It has over 21,000 students and has an MBA programme that is ranked 51st by the Financial Times in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/econstats/pdf/compete.zip|title=Competitiveness factors|publisher=City of Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the top-ranked university in Africa, being the only African university to make the world's Top 200 university list at number 146.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university/98/university-of-cape-town |title=University of cape town |publisher=Top Universities |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[African National Congress]] has come into governmental power, some restructuring of Western Cape universities has taken place and as such, traditionally non-white universities have seen increased financing, which has benefitted the University of the Western Cape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.at/heritage/society/index.htm|title=Cape Town Society|publisher=CapeConnected}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/1998/01/20/PAGE7.HTM|title=Education Cosas critical of education funding|publisher=Dispatch Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public Cape Peninsula University of Technology was formed on 1 January 2005, when two separate institutions – [[Cape Technikon]] and [[Peninsula Technikon]] – were merged. The new university offers education primarily in English, although one may take courses in any of South Africa's official languages. The institution generally awards the [[National Diploma (South Africa)|National Diploma]].

== Transport ==

;Air
[[File:International flights from Cape Town International Airport.svg|thumb|right|Map showing flights from Cape Town International Airport to destinations outside Southern Africa.]]
[[Cape Town International Airport]] serves both domestic and international flights. It is the second-largest airport in South Africa and serves as a major gateway for travellers to the Cape region. Cape Town has direct flights to most cities in South Africa as well as a number of international destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/plan_trip/travel_tips/arriving/ctairport.htm|title=Cape Town International Airport|publisher=SouthAfrica.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cape Town International Airport recently opened a brand new central terminal building that was developed to handle an expected increase in air traffic as tourism numbers will increase in the lead-up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.co.za/1998/05/17/news/cape/nct01.htm|work=Sunday Times |location=UK |title=R150-million upgrade kicks off one of the biggest developments in Cape Town's history|date=17 May 1998|first=Bobby|last=Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other renovations include several large new parking garages, a revamped domestic departure terminal, a new Bus Rapid Transit system station and a new double-decker road system. The airport's cargo facilities are also being expanded and several large empty lots are being developed into [[office|office space]] and hotels.

The Cape Town International Airport was among the winners of the [[World Travel Awards]] for being Africa's leading airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctru.co.za/C3/CapeTownInternationalAirportamongtheWorld.pdf|title=Cape Town International Airport|publisher=Cape Town Routes Unlimited|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sea
[[File:Table Mountain from harbour.jpg|thumb|right|Table Mountain from the Harbour.]]
Cape Town has a long tradition as a port city. The [[Port of Cape Town]], the city's main port, is located in [[Table Bay]] directly to the north of the central business district. The port is a hub for ships in the southern Atlantic: it is located along one of the busiest shipping corridors in the world. It is also a busy container port, second in South Africa only to [[Durban]]. In 2004, it handled 3,161 ships and 9.2&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ports.co.za/port-operations.php|publisher=South African Port Operations|title=Introducing SAPO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon's Town, Cape Town|Simon's Town Harbour]] on the [[False Bay]] coast of the [[Cape Peninsula]] is the main base of the [[South African Navy]].

The Port of Cape Town (specifically the [[V&amp;A Waterfront]]) made headlines worldwide during 2009 when plans to berth the iconic liner [[QE2]] were announced.

;Rail
[[File:Kalk Bay Station 3.jpg|thumb|right|A Metrorail train leaving [[Kalk Bay]] station]]
The ''[[Shosholoza Meyl]]'' is the passenger rail operations of [[Spoornet]] and operates two long-distance passenger rail services from Cape Town: a daily service to and from [[Johannesburg]] via [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]] and a weekly service to and from [[Durban]] via [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]], [[Bloemfontein]] and [[Pietermaritzburg]]. These trains terminate at [[Cape Town railway station]] and make a brief stop at [[Bellville railway station|Bellville]]. Cape Town is also one terminus of the luxury tourist-oriented [[Blue Train (South Africa)|Blue Train]] as well as the five-star [[Rovos Rail]].

[[Metrorail (Western Cape)|Metrorail]] operates a [[commuter rail]] service in Cape Town and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network consists of 96 stations throughout the suburbs and outskirts of Cape Town.

;Road
[[File:Cape Town N2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]], also known as the Eastern Boulevard, as it enters the [[City Bowl, Cape Town|City Bowl]] and ends in the Central Business District]]
Three [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]] start in Cape Town: the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] which links Cape Town with [[Bloemfontein]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Pretoria]] and [[Zimbabwe]]; the [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] which links Cape Town with [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London, South Africa|East London]] and [[Durban]]; and the [[N7 (South Africa)|N7]] which links Cape Town with the [[Northern Cape Province]] and [[Namibia]]. The N1 and N2 both start in the Central Business District, and split to the east of the CBD, with the N1 continuing to the north east and the N2 heading south east past [[Cape Town International Airport]]. The N7 starts in [[Mitchells Plain]] and runs north, intersecting with the N1 and the N2 before leaving the city.

Cape Town also has a system of freeway and [[dual carriageway]] M-roads, which connect different parts of the city. The [[M3 (Cape Town)|M3]] splits from the N2 and runs to the south along the eastern slopes of [[Table Mountain]], connecting the City Bowl with [[Muizenberg]]. The [[M5 (Cape Town)|M5]] splits from the N1 further east than the M3, and links the Cape Flats to the CBD. The [[R300 (Western Cape)|R300]], which is informally known as the ''Cape Flats Freeway'', links [[Mitchells Plain]] with [[Bellville, South Africa|Bellville]], the N1 and the N2.

;Buses
[[Golden Arrow Bus Services]] operates scheduled bus services throughout the Cape Town metropolitan area. Several companies run long-distance bus services from Cape Town to the other cities in South Africa.

;Integrated Rapid Transit

Cape Town has embarked on Phase 1 of the IRT system with a total investment of close to R5&amp;nbsp;billion.
Phase 1 will include a West Coast Service, Inner City Service and Airport Link. A 2010 Starter service to meet the requirements for the FIFA World Cup will include an Inner City Service, Stadium Shuttle and Airport Service. A total of 43 IRT Volvo buses have been ordered and are expected to be delivered during April and May.

;Taxis
[[File:Cape-Town-taxi-rank.jpg|thumb|right|Cape Town taxi rank above train station]]
Cape Town has two kinds of taxis: [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[minibus taxi]]s. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city to solicit fares and instead must be called to a specific location.

Minibus taxis are the standard form of transport for the majority of the population who cannot afford private vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8|publisher=CapeTown.org|title=Transport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although essential, these taxis are often poorly maintained and are frequently not road-worthy. These taxis make frequent unscheduled stops to pick up passengers, which can cause accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1566/is_200209/ai_n7215423|title=South Africa's minibus wars: uncontrollable law-defying minibuses oust buses and trains from transit|publisher=LookSmart}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewclimate.org/global-warming-in-depth/all_reports/transportation_in_south_africa/trans_sa_execsumm.cfm|title=Transportation in Developing Countries: Greenhouse Gas Scenarios for South Africa|publisher=Pew Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the high demand for transport by the working class of South Africa, minibus taxis are often filled over their legal passenger allowance, making for high casualty rates when minibuses are involved in accidents. Minibuses are generally owned and operated in fleets, and inter-operator violence flares up from time to time, especially as [[Taxi wars in South Africa|turf wars]] occur over lucrative taxi routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterpriseafrica.org/repository/docLib/20060427_MC_GPI_EATaxi_060323.pdf|format=PDF|title=Taxing Alternatives: Poverty Alleviation and the South African Taxi/Minibus Industry|publisher=Enterprise Africa!

The '''Chicago Cubs''' are an [[United States|American]] professional [[baseball]] team based in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].
They are members of the [[National League Central|Central Division]] of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[National League]]. They are one of two Major League clubs based in Chicago (the other being the [[Chicago White Sox]]). The Cubs are also one of the two remaining charter members of the National League (the other being the [[Atlanta Braves]]).  The team is currently owned by a family trust of [[TD Ameritrade]] founder [[J. Joseph Ricketts|Joe Ricketts]], and was previously owned by the [[Wrigley Company]] and the [[Chicago Tribune]].

The Cubs have not won the [[World Series]] in {{age|1908|10|14}} years, a [[List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts|longer championship drought]] than that of any other [[Major professional sports teams of the United States and Canada|major North American professional sports team]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2823256|first=John|last=Helyar|title=Lovable losers?

and are often referred to as &quot;The Lovable Losers&quot; because of this distinction. They are also known as &quot;The North Siders&quot; because [[Wrigley Field]], their home park since 1916, is located in Chicago's north side [[Lake View, Chicago|Lake View]] community at 1060 West Addison Street. The Cubs have rivalries with the [[Cardinals–Cubs rivalry|St. Louis Cardinals]], the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], the [[Houston Astros]], and the cross-town [[White Sox–Cubs rivalry|White Sox]].

The club played its first games in 1870 and was founded professionally in 1871.  This makes it, along with the [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] who were also founded in 1871, one of the two oldest active teams in [[Major North American professional sports teams|major North American sports]].  Because the Cubs lost two seasons to the [[Great Chicago Fire]], the Braves have played more seasons, although the Cubs hold the record for oldest team still in its original city.

==Early franchise history==
{{Main|Chicago Cubs franchise history}}

===1876–1902: A National League dynasty===
[[File:1876 white stockings.jpg|thumb|left|160px|right|The 1876 White Stockings won the N.L. Championship]][[William Hulbert]], president of Chicago's club, the White Stockings, signed multiple star players, such as pitcher [[Albert Spalding]] and infielders [[Ross Barnes]], [[Deacon White]], and [[Cap Anson|Adrian &quot;Cap&quot; Anson]], to join the team prior to the N.L.'s inaugural season of [[1876 in baseball|1876]]. The Chicago franchise, playing its home games at [[West Side Grounds]], quickly established itself as one of the new league's top teams. Spalding won 47 games and Barnes led the league in hitting at .429 as Chicago won the first ever National League [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]], which at the time was the game's top prize.

After back-to-back pennants in 1880 and '81, Hulbert died, and Spalding, who had retired to start [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] sporting goods, assumed ownership of the club. The White Stockings, with Anson acting as player/manager, captured their third consecutive pennant in 1882, and Anson established himself as the game's first true superstar. In 1885 and '86, after winning N.L. pennants, the White Stockings met the short-lived '''[[American Association (19th century)|American Association]]''' champion in that era's version of a World Series. Both seasons resulted in matchups with the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Brown Stockings]], with the clubs tying in '85 and with St. Louis winning in '86. This was the genesis of what would eventually become one of the greatest [[Cardinals–Cubs rivalry|rivalries]] in sports. In all, the Anson-led Chicago Base Ball Club won six National League pennants between 1876 and 1886. As a result, Chicago's club nickname transitioned, and by [[1890 in baseball|1890]] they had become known as the '''Chicago Colts''',&lt;ref name=&quot;1890colts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1890.shtml|title=1890 Chicago Colts |publisher=baseball-reference.com|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes &quot;Anson's Colts,&quot; referring to Cap's influence within the club. Anson was the first player in history credited with collecting [[3,000 hit club|3,000 career hits]], and when he left the team in 1898, the loss of his leadership resulted in the team becoming known as the '''Chicago Orphans''' (or Remnants) and a few forgettable seasons.

After the [[1900 in baseball|1900]] season, the [[American League|'''American Base-Ball League''']] formed as a rival professional league, and incidentally the club's old White Stockings nickname would be adopted by a new American League neighbor to the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;1898orphans&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1898.shtml|title=1898 Chicago Orphans|publisher=baseball-reference.com|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1902–1920: A Cub dynasty===
[[File:Chicago Cubs team picture, 1906.jpg|thumb|left|200px|right|The 1906 Cubs won a record 116 of 154 games. They then won back to back World Series titles in 1907–08]] In 1902, Spalding, who by this time had revamped the roster to boast what would soon be one of the best teams of the early century, sold the club to [[Jim Hart (baseball)|Jim Hart]], and the franchise became known as the '''Chicago Cubs.'''&lt;ref name=&quot;1903cubs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1903.shtml|title=1903 Chicago Cubs|publisher=baseball-reference.com|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, which has become known as baseball's [[dead-ball era]], Cub [[infielder]]s [[Joe Tinker]], [[Johnny Evers]], and [[Frank Chance]] were made famous as a double-play combination by [[Franklin P. Adams]]' poem ''[[Baseball's Sad Lexicon]]''. The poem first appeared in the July 18, 1910 edition of the ''[[New York Evening Mail]]''. [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai &quot;Three-Finger&quot; Brown]], [[Jack Taylor (20th century baseball player)|Jack Taylor]], [[Ed Reulbach]], [[Jack Pfiester]], and [[Orval Overall]] were several key pitchers for the Cubs during this time period. With Chance acting as player-manager from 1905 to 1912, the Cubs won four pennants and two World Series titles over a five-year span. Although they fell to the White Sox in the [[1906 World Series]], the Cubs recorded a record 116 victories and the [[List of best MLB season records|best winning percentage]] (.763) in Major League history. With mostly the same roster, Chicago won back-to-back World Series championships in [[1907 World Series|1907]] and [[1908 World Series|1908]]. Their appearance in three consecutive World Series made the Cubs the first Major League club to play three times in the Fall Classic. Likewise, their back-to-back World Series victories in 1907 and 1908 made them the first club to win two World Series. However, the Cubs have not won a World Series since 1908; this remains the longest championship drought in North American professional sports.

[[Image:1913 Chicago Cubs.jpg|thumb|right|1913 Cubs]]
The next season, veteran catcher [[Johnny Kling]] left the team to become a professional [[pocket billiards]] player. Some historians think Kling's absence was significant enough to prevent the Cubs from also winning a third straight title in 1909, as they finished 6 games out of first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Three Finger|first=Cindy|last=Thomson|first2=Scott|last2=Brown|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-4448-7|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kling returned the next year, the Cubs won the [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] again, but lost to the Philadelphia Athletics in the [[1910 World Series]].

In 1914, advertising executive [[Albert Lasker]] obtained a large block of the club's shares and before the 1916 season assumed majority ownership of the franchise. Lasker brought in a wealthy partner, [[Charles Weeghman]], the proprietor of a popular chain of lunch counters who had previously owned the [[Chicago Whales]] of the short-lived [[Federal League]]. As principal owners, the pair moved the club from the West Side Grounds to the much newer [[Weeghman Park]], which had been constructed for the Whales only two years earlier. The Cubs responded by winning a pennant in the war-shortened season of 1918, where they played a part in another team's curse. The [[Boston Red Sox]] defeated [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]]'s Cubs four games to two in the [[1918 World Series]]. After the victory Boston's owner sold its star pitcher, [[Babe Ruth]], to the [[New York Yankees]] to help funding of a Broadway play, and thus starting a tale of futility which would last 86 years, known as ''[[Curse of the Bambino]]''.

==The Wrigley years (1921–1981)==
===Double-Bills take over===
[[File:Cubs1932.gif|thumb|left|Cub logo in the '20s &amp; '30s]]
During what is often called baseball's ''&quot;[[Baseball's Golden Age|golden age]]&quot;,'' one of Cubs's minority owners, [[William Wrigley Jr.]], who also happened to be the owner of [[Wrigley Company]], a Chicago-based maker of chewing gum, would begin to increase his share of ownership. Wrigley was responsible for the 1917 acquisition of astute baseball man [[William Veeck, Sr.]] to serve as Vice-President and Treasurer, and for later promoting Veeck to Club President in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cubs|first=Glenn|last=Stout|first2=Richard|last2=Johnson|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0618595006|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 Wrigley bought Weeghman's shares and by 1925 had acquired most of Lasker's shares as well. Wrigley then changed the name of Weeghman Park to its current name, Wrigley Field, in perhaps the earliest example of corporate [[naming rights]]. With Wrigley's vast monetary resources and Veeck's front-office savvy, the &quot;double-Bills&quot; soon had the Cubs back in business in the National League, building a team that would put numerous future Hall of Famers in Cub uniforms. Some of the most notable of these players were [[Hack Wilson]], [[Gabby Hartnett]], and [[Rogers Hornsby]] and thus Chicago remained strong contenders for the next decade.

===1929–1938: Every three years===
During the end of the first decade of the double-Bills' guidance, the Cubs won the NL pennant in 1929 and then achieved the unusual feat of winning a pennant every three years, following up the 1929 flag with league titles in 1932, 1935, and 1938. Unfortunately, their success did not extend to the [[List of baseball jargon (F)|Fall Classic]], as they fell to their [[American League|AL]] rivals each time. The [[1932 World Series|'32 series]] against the [[1932 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] featured Babe Ruth's &quot;[[Babe Ruth's called shot|called shot]]&quot; at Wrigley Field. There were some historic moments for the Cubs as well; they claimed the '35 pennant in thrilling fashion, winning a record 21 games in a row in September. The [[1938 Chicago Cubs season|'38 club]] saw [[Dizzy Dean]] lead the team's pitching staff and provided a historic moment when they won a crucial late-season game at Wrigley Field over the [[1938 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] with a [[walk-off home run]] by Gabby Hartnett, which became known in baseball [[folklore|lore]] as &quot;[[The Homer in the Gloamin']]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Marc | last=Zarefsky | title='Homer in the Gloamin' most memorable | date=2007-08-08 | publisher=MLB.com | url =http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/chc/y2007/m07/d20/c2099223.jsp | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939, the &quot;double-Bills&quot; (Wrigley and Veeck) had both died, and the front office, now under [[P.K. Wrigley]], found itself unable to rekindle the kind of success that P.K.'s father had created, and so the team slipped into a few years of mediocrity.

===1945: The Curse===
{{Main|Curse of the Billy Goat}}
The Cubs enjoyed one more pennant at the close of [[World War II]], finishing 98–56. Due to the [[war]]time travel restrictions, the first three games of the [[1945 World Series]] were played in [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Detroit]], where the Cubs won two games, including a one-hitter by [[Claude Passeau]], and the final four were played at Wrigley. In Game 4 of the Series, the [[Curse of the Billy Goat]] was allegedly laid upon the Cubs when P.K. Wrigley ejected [[Billy Sianis]], who had come to Game 4 with two box seat tickets, one for him and one for his goat. They paraded around for a few innings, but Wrigley demanded the goat leave the park due to its [[unpleasant odor]]. Upon his ejection, Mr. Sianis uttered, ''&quot;The Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more.&quot;'' The Cubs lost Game 4, lost the Series, and have not been back since. It has also been said by many that Sianis put a &quot;curse&quot; on the Cubs, apparently preventing the team from playing in the World Series. After losing the 1945 World Series to the [[Detroit Tigers]], the Cubs finished with winning seasons the next two years, but those teams did not enter post-season play.

In the following two decades after Sianis' ill will, the Cubs played mostly forgettable baseball, finishing among the worst teams in the National League on an almost annual basis. Longtime infielder/manager [[Phil Cavarretta]], who had been a key player during the '45 season, was fired during spring training in 1954 after admitting the team was unlikely to finish above fifth place. Although shortstop [[Ernie Banks]] would become one of the star players in the league during the next decade, finding help for him proved a difficult task, as quality players such as [[Hank Sauer]] were few and far between. This, combined with poor ownership decisions (such as the [[College of Coaches]]), hampered on-field performance.

.

===1969: The fall of '69===
{{Main|1969 Chicago Cubs season}}
The late-1960s brought hope of a renaissance, with third baseman [[Ron Santo]], pitcher [[Ferguson Jenkins]], and outfielder [[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy Williams]] joining Banks. After losing a dismal 103 games in 1966, the Cubs brought home consecutive winning records in [[1967 Major League Baseball season|'67]] and [[1968 Major League Baseball season|'68]], marking the first time a Cub team had accomplished that feat in over two decades.

In {{mlby|1969}} the Cubs, managed by [[Leo Durocher]], built a substantial lead in the newly created [[National League East]]ern Division by mid-August. [[Ken Holtzman]] pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 {{frac|1|2}} games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 {{frac|1|2}} games over the [[1969 New York Mets season|New York Mets]]. Ultimately, however, the Cubs wilted under pressure. Although they had their best season in decades at 92–70, they lost key games against the Mets and finished the season a disappointing eight games out of first place while the Mets exploded past them by winning 39 of their last 50 games. Many superstitious fans attribute this collapse to an incident at [[Shea Stadium]] when a fan released a [[black cat]] onto the field, further cursing the club, although the &quot;''Amazin' Mets''&quot; ended the season at a torrid pace, finishing with a remarkable 100 wins.

===1977–1979: The June Swoon===
{{Main|1977 Chicago Cubs season}}
Following the '69 season, the club posted winning records for the next few seasons, but no playoff action. After the core players of those teams started to move on, the 70s got worse for the team, and they became known as ''&quot;The Loveable Losers.&quot;'' In [[1977 Major League Baseball season|1977]], the team found some life, but ultimately experienced one of its [http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1977.shtml biggest collapses.] The Cubs hit a high-water mark on June 28 at 47–22, boasting an 8½ game NL East lead, as they were led by [[Bobby Murcer]] (27 Hr/89 RBI), and [[Rick Reuschel]] (20–10). However, the [[1977 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] cut the lead to two by the All-star break, as the Cubs sat 19 games over .500, but they swooned late in the season, going 20–40 after July 31. The Cubs finished in 4th place at 81–81, while Philadelphia surged, finishing with 101 wins. Ironically, the following two seasons also saw the Cubs get off to a fast start, as the team rallied to over 10 games above .500 well into both seasons, only to again wear down and play poorly later on, and ultimately settling back to mediocrity. This trait became known as the &quot;''June Swoon''.&quot; Again, the Cubs' unusually high number of day games is often pointed to as one reason for the team's inconsistent late season play.

==1981–2008==
===1984: Heartbreak===
{{Main|1984 Chicago Cubs season}}
After over a dozen more subpar seasons, in 1981 the Cubs hired GM [[Dallas Green]] from Philadelphia to turn around the franchise. Green had managed the 1980 Phillies to the World Series title. One of his early GM moves brought in a young Phillies minor-league 3rd baseman named Ryne Sandberg, along with Larry Bowa for Ivan Dejesus. The 1983 Cubs had finished 71–91 under Lee Elia, who was fired before the season ended by Green. Green continued the culture of change and overhauled the Cubs roster, front-office and coaching staff prior to 1984. [[Jim Frey]] was hired to manage the 1984 Cubs, with [[Don Zimmer]] coaching 3rd base and [[Billy Connors]] serving as pitching coach.

Green shored&lt;ref name=1984Cubs/&gt; up the 1984 roster with a series of transactions. In December, 1983 [[Scott Sanderson]] was acquired from Montreal in a three-team deal with San Diego for [[Carmelo Martinez]]. Pinch hitter [[Richie Hebner]] (.333 BA in 1984) was signed as a free-agent. In spring training, moves continued: LF [[Gary Matthews]] and CF [[Bobby Dernier]] came from Philadelphia on March 26, for [[Bill Campbell (baseball)|Bill Campbell]] and a minor leaguer. Reliever Tim Stoddard (10–6 3.82, 7 saves) was acquired the same day for a minor leaguer; veteran pitcher (and future [[Hall Of Fame]]r) [[Ferguson Jenkins]] was released.

The team's commitment to contend was complete when Green made a midseason deal on June 13 to shore up the starting rotation due to injuries to [[Rick Reuschel]] (5–5) and Sanderson. The deal brought 1979 NL Rookie of the Year pitcher [[Rick Sutcliffe]] from the Cleveland Indians. Iowa Cub [[Joe Carter]] and CF [[Mel Hall]] were sent to Cleveland for Sutcliffe and back-up C Ron Hassey (.333 with Cubs in 1984). Sutcliffe (5–5 with the Indians) immediately joined Sanderson (8–5 3.14), Eckersley (10–8 3.03), [[Steve Trout]] (13–7 3.41) and [[Dick Ruthven]] (6–10 5.04) in the starting rotation. Sutcliffe proceeded to go 16–1 for Cubs and capture the [[Cy Young Award]].&lt;ref name=1984Cubs/&gt;

The Cubs 1984 starting lineup was very strong.&lt;ref name=1984Cubs/&gt; It consisted of LF Matthews (.291 14–82 101 runs 17 SB), C [[Jody Davis (baseball)|Jody Davis]] (.256 19–94), RF [[Keith Moreland]] (.279 16–80), SS [[Larry Bowa]] (.223 10 SB), 1B [[Leon &quot;Bull&quot; Durham]] (.279 23–96 16SB), CF Dernier (.278 45 SB), 3B [[Ron Cey]] (.240 25–97), Closer [[Lee Smith (baseball)|Lee Smith]](9–7 3.65 33 saves) and 1984 NL MVP and future Hall of Famer [[Ryne Sandberg]] (.314 19–84 114 runs, 19 triples,32 SB).&lt;ref name=1984Cubs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1984.shtml|title=1984 Chicago Cubs Batting, Pitching, &amp; Fielding Statistics|work=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reserve players Hebner, [[Thad Bosley]], [[Henry Cotto]], Hassey and [[Dave Owen]] produced exciting moments. The bullpen depth of [[Rich Bordi]], [[George Frazier]], [[Warren Brusstar]] and [[Dickie Noles]] did their job in getting the game to Smith or Stoddard.

At the top of the order, Dernier and Sandberg were exciting, aptly coined &quot;the Daily Double&quot; by [[Harry Caray]]. With strong defense – Dernier CF and Sandberg 2B, won the NL [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]]- solid pitching and clutch hitting, the Cubs were a well balanced team. Following the &quot;Daily Double,&quot; Matthews, Durham, Cey, Moreland and Davis gave the Cubs an order with no gaps to pitch around. Sutcliffe anchored a strong top to bottom rotation and Smith was one of the top closers in the game.

The shift in the Cubs' fortunes were characterized June 23 on the &quot;NBC Saturday Game of the Week&quot; contest against the St. Louis Cardinals. it has since been dubbed simply &quot;[[The Sandberg Game]].&quot; With the nation watching and Wrigley Field packed, Sandberg emerged as a superstar with not one, but two game-tying home runs against Cardinals closer [[Bruce Sutter]]. With his shots in the 9th and 10th innings Wrigley Field erupted and Sandberg set the stage for a comeback win that cemented the Cubs as the team to beat in the East. No one would catch them.

In early August the Cubs swept the Mets in a 4-game home series that further distanced them from the pack. An infamous Keith Moreland-[[Ed Lynch (pitcher)|Ed Lynch]] fight erupted after Lynch hit Moreland with a pitch, perhaps forgetting Moreland was once a linebacker at the University of Texas. It was the second game of a double header and the Cubs had won the first game in part due to a three run home run by Moreland. After the bench-clearing fight the Cubs won the second game, and the sweep put the Cubs at 68–45.

When the Cubs clinched the Eastern Division with a Sutcliffe complete-game 2-hitter at Pittsburgh on September 23, the franchise had its first title of any kind since 1945. The celebrating crowd outside at Wrigley Field was enormous despite the fact the Cubs were on the road. The Cubs concluded the regular season with a 96–65 record, 6.5 games ahead of the 2nd place Mets.

In 1984, the two leagues, American and National, each had two divisions, East and West. The divisional winners met in a best-of-5 series to advance to the World Series, in a &quot;2–3&quot; format, first two games were played at the home of the team who did not have home field advantage. Then the last three games were played at the home of the team, with home field advantage. Thus the first two games were played at Wrigley Field and the next three at the home of their opponents, San Diego. A common and unfounded myth is that since Wrigley Field did not have lights at that time the National League decided to give the home field advantage to the winner of the NL West. In fact, home field advantage had rotated between the winners of the East and West since 1969 when the league expanded. In even numbered years, the NL West had home field advantage. In odd numbered years, the NL East had home field advantage. Since the NL East winners had had home field advantage in 1983, the NL West winners were entitled to it.

The confusion may stem from the fact that Major League Baseball did decide that, should the Cubs make it to the World Series, the American League winner would have home field advantage. At the time home field advantage was rotated between each league. Odd numbered years the AL had home field advantage. Even numbered years the NL had home field advantage. In the 1982 World Series the St. Louis Cardinals of the NL had home field advantage. In the 1983 World Series the Baltimore Orioles of the AL had home field advantage.

In the [[1984 National League Championship Series|NLCS]], the Cubs easily won the first two games at Wrigley Field against the [[1984 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]]. The Padres were the winners of the Western Division with [[Steve Garvey]], a young Future Hall of Famer [[Tony Gwynn]], [[Eric Show]], future Hall of Famer [[Goose Gossage]] and [[Alan Wiggins]]. With wins of 13–0 and 4–2, the Cubs needed to win only one game of the next three in San Diego to make to the World Series. After being beaten in Game 3 7–1. The Cubs lost Game 4 when Smith, with the game tied 5–5, allowed a game-winning home run to Garvey in the bottom of the ninth inning. In Game 5 the Cubs took a 3–0 lead into the 6th inning, and a 3–2 lead into the seventh with Sutcliffe (who won the [[Cy Young Award]] that year) still on the mound. Then, Leon Durham had a sharp grounder go under his glove. This critical error helped the Padres win the game 6–3, with a 4-run 7th inning and keep Chicago out of the [[1984 World Series]] against the [[Detroit Tigers]]. The loss ended a spectacular season for the Cubs, one that brought alive a slumbering franchise and made the Cubs relevant for a whole new generation of Cubs fans.

The Padres would be defeated by Sparky Anderson's Tigers in the World Series.

The 1985 season brought high hopes. The club started out well, going 35–19 through mid-June, but injuries to Sutcliffe and others in the pitching staff contributed to a 13 game losing streak that pushed the Cubs out of contention.

===1989: NL East champions===
{{Main|1989 Chicago Cubs season}}
In 1989, the first full season with night baseball at Wrigley Field, [[Don Zimmer]]'s Cubs were led by a core group of veterans in [[Ryne Sandberg]], Cy-Young runner-up [[Rick Sutcliffe]] and [[Andre Dawson]], who were boosted by a crop of youngsters such as [[Mark Grace]], [[Shawon Dunston]], [[Greg Maddux]], Rookie of the Year [[Jerome Walton]], and Rookie of the Year Runner-Up Dwight Smith. The Cubs won the NL East once again that season winning 93 games. This time the Cubs met the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in the [[1989 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. After splitting the first two games at home, the Cubs headed to the Bay Area, where despite holding a lead at some point in each of the next three games, bullpen meltdowns and managerial blunders ultimately led to three straight losses. The Cubs couldn't overcome the efforts of Will Clark, whose home run off Maddux, just after a managerial visit to the mound, led Maddux to think Clark knew what pitch was coming. Afterward, Maddux would speak into his glove during any mound conversation, beginning what is a norm today. Mark Grace was 11–17 in the series with 8 RBI. Eventually, the Giants lost to &quot;''[[José Canseco|The Bash]] [[Mark McGwire|Brothers]]''&quot; and the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] in the famous &quot;''[[1989 World Series|Earthquake Series]]''.&quot;

===1998: Wild card race &amp; home run chase===
{{Main|1998 Chicago Cubs season|1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase}}
The [[1998 Major League Baseball season|'98 season]] would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster [[Harry Caray]]. After the retirement of [[Ryne Sandberg]] and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs needed pop and the signing [[Henry Rodriguez]] to bat cleanup provided protection for [[Sammy Sosa]] in the lineup. [[Mark Grace]] turned in one of his best seasons. Called up after beginning the year at Iowa, the club got a Rookie of the Year effort from pitcher [[Kerry Wood]]. Wood's signature performance was a one-hit, 20 strikeout performance versus the [[1998 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]] that established the flamethrower as an immediate star. ''&quot;H-Rod&quot;'' paid dividends by slugging 31 round-trippers, [[Rod Beck]] anchored a strong bullpen and Sosa earned the N.L.'s MVP award with a 66 home run season. The club and Sosa caught fire in June, with Sosa hitting 20 home runs in the month. Eventually, with all media attention on Sosa and Mark McGwire of the Cardinals with their home run totals rising, the Cubs ended the regular season tied in the down-to-the-wire [[Wild card (sports)|Wild Card]] chase with the San Francisco Giants. This resulted with the [[1998 San Francisco Giants season|Giants]] and Cubs squaring off in a one game playoff at Wrigley Field. Third baseman [[Gary Gaetti]] hit the eventual game winning homer and Beck got Joe Carter to pop up to kill a Giants rally in the 9th inning and the Cubs celebrated. The win propelled the Cubs into the postseason once again with a 90–73 regular season tally. Unfortunately, the [http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080827&amp;content_id=3375336&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chcNorthsiders' bats] went cold in October, as manager [[Jim Riggleman]]'s club batted .183 and scored only four runs en route to being swept by [[1998 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta]]. On a positive note, the home run chase between Sosa, [[Mark McGwire]] and [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] generated a great deal of media coverage, and helped to bring in a new crop of fans as well as bringing back some fans who had been disillusioned by the [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|1994 strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sosa discusses future, McGwire's Hall chances | date=2006-12-04 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2683234 | work =Associated Press | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubs retained many players who experienced career years in '98, and after a fast start in 1999, they collapsed again (starting with being swept at the hands of the cross-town [[1998 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] in mid-June) and finished in the bottom of the division for the next two seasons.

===2001: Playoff push===
{{Main|2001 Chicago Cubs season}}
Despite losing fan favorite Grace to free agency, and the lack of production from newcomer [[Todd Hundley]], skipper [[Don Baylor]]'s Cubs put together a good season in 2001. The [[2001 Major League Baseball season|season]] started with Mack Newton being brought in to preach &quot;positive thinking.&quot; One of the biggest stories of the season transpired as the club made a midseason deal for [[Fred McGriff]], which was drawn out for nearly a month as McGriff debated waiving his [[no-trade clause]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Cubs still waiting for McGriff's OK | date=2001-07-14 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1226222&amp;type=news | work = Associated Press | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Cubs led the wild card race by 2.5 games in early September. That run died when [[Preston Wilson]] hit a three run walk off homer off of closer [[Tom Gordon|Tom &quot;Flash&quot; Gordon]], which halted the team's momentum. The team was unable to make another serious charge, and finished at 88–74, five games behind both [[2001 Houston Astros season|Houston]] and [[2001 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]], who tied for first. Sosa had perhaps his finest season and [[Jon Lieber]] led the staff with a 20 win season.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/2001.shtml 2001 Chicago Cubs Statistics and Roster]&quot;, Baseball-Reference.com. Retrieved on June 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003: Five more outs===
{{Main|2003 Chicago Cubs season}}

The Cubs had high expectations in 2002, but the squad played poorly, and the club responded by hiring [[Dusty Baker]] and by making some major moves in '03. Most notably, they traded with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for outfielder [[Kenny Lofton]] and third baseman [[Aramis Ramirez]], and rode dominant pitching, led by Kerry Wood and Mark Prior, as the Cubs led the division down the stretch.

Chicago halted St. Louis' run to the playoffs by taking 4 of 5 games from the Cardinals at Wrigley Field in early September. The Cubs could easily have swept the series had it not been for a blown call in the third game, in which a line drive by [[Moisés Alou]] late in the game was called foul by the third base umpire. Replays clearly showed that the ball was indeed fair, which would have scored at least two runs had the correct call been made. This series ultimately led to the Cubs winning their first division title in 14 years.

In what was a dramatic five game series, their [[2003 National League Division Series|NLDS]] victory over the [[2003 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] was the franchise's first postseason series win since they went to the World Series in 1908, when they beat the [[Detroit Tigers]] in five games. After losing an extra-inning game in Game 1, the Cubs rallied and took a 3 games to 1 lead over the Wild Card [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] in the [[2003 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. Florida shut the Cubs out in Game 5, but young pitcher [[Mark Prior]] led the Cubs in Game 6 as they took a 3–0 lead into the 8th inning and it was at this point when a now-infamous incident took place. Several spectators attempted to catch a foul ball off the bat of [[Luis Castillo (baseball)|Luis Castillo]]. One of the fans, [[Steve Bartman incident|Steve Bartman]], of Northbrook, IL, reached for the ball and deflected it away from the glove of Moisés Alou for the second out of the inning. Alou reacted angrily toward the stands, and after the game stated that he would have caught the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartman&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Report: Alou initially said he would have caught the Bartman ball | year=2004 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3423732170 | work =Associated Press | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alou at one point recanted, saying he would not have been able to make the play, but later said this was just an attempt to make Bartman feel better and believing the whole incident should be forgotten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartman&quot;/&gt; Interference was not called on the play, as the ball was ruled to be on the spectator side of the wall. Castillo was eventually walked by Prior. Two batters later, and to the horror of the packed stadium, Cubs shortstop [[Alex S. Gonzalez|Alex Gonzalez]] misplayed a potential inning ending double play, loading the bases and leading to eight Florida runs and a Marlin victory. Despite sending [[Kerry Wood]] to the mound and holding a lead twice, the Cubs ultimately dropped Game 7, and failed to reach the [[2003 World Series|World Series]].

===2004–2006===
{{Main|2004 Chicago Cubs season}}
In [[2003 Major League Baseball season|2004]], despite the return of [[Greg Maddux]] and a midseason deal for [[Nomar Garciaparra]], misfortune struck the Cubs again. They led the Wild Card by 1.5 games over [[2004 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco]] and [[2004 Houston Astros season|Houston]] on September 25, and both of those teams lost that day, giving the Cubs a chance at increasing the lead to a commanding 2.5 games with only eight games remaining in the season, but reliever [[LaTroy Hawkins]] blew a save to the [[2004 New York Mets season|Mets]], and the Cubs lost the game in extra innings, a defeat that seemingly deflated the team, as they proceeded to drop 6 of their last 8 games as the Astros won the Wild Card. Despite the fact that the Cubs had won 89 games, this fallout was decidedly unlovable, as the Cubs traded superstar [[Sammy Sosa]] after he had left the season's final game early and then lied about it publicly. Already a controversial figure in the clubhouse after his [[Sammy Sosa#Corked bat incident|corked-bat incident]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jayson | last=Stark | title=Sosa's legacy could be broken beyond repair | date=2004-06-02 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | url =http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/stark_jayson/1562825.html | accessdate = 2008-06-11|authorlink=Jayson Stark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sammy alienated much of his fan base, the few teammates still on good terms with him, and possibly tarnished his place in Cubs' lore for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Carrie | last=Muskat | title=Cubs, Sosa at odds | date=2004-10-04 | publisher=MLB.com | url =http://cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20041004&amp;content_id=882478&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disappointing season also saw fans start to become frustrated with the constant injuries to ace pitchers Mark Prior and Kerry Wood. Additionally, the '04 season led to the departure of popular commentator [[Steve Stone (baseball player)|Steve Stone]], who had become increasingly critical of management during broadcasts and was verbally attacked by reliever [[Kent Mercker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Cubs shocked by Stone's comments | date=2004-10-05 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | url =http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1893170 | work =Associated Press | accessdate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Things were no better in [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], despite a career year from [[Derrek Lee]] and the emergence of closer [[Ryan Dempster]]. The club struggled and suffered more key injuries, only managing to win 79 games after being picked by many to be a serious contender for the N.L. pennant. In 2006, the Cubs finished 66–96, last in the [[NL Central]].

After finishing last in the N.L. Central with 66 wins in 2006, the Cubs re-tooled and went from &quot;worst to first&quot; in 2007. In the offseason they inked [[Alfonso Soriano]] to the richest contract in Cubs history, 8 years, $136 million,&lt;ref&gt;Muscat, Carrie, [http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061120&amp;content_id=1743683&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc Cubs complete blockbuster with Soriano], MLB.com, Retrieved on July 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced unpopular skipper [[Dusty Baker]] with fiery veteran manager [[Lou Piniella]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/team/coach_staff_bio.jsp?c_id=chc&amp;coachorstaffid=120586 Lou Piniella Bio]&quot;, MLB.com, Retrieved on July 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; After a rough start, which included a brawl between [[Michael Barrett (baseball)|Michael Barrett]] and [[Carlos Zambrano]], the Cubs overcame the [[2007 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]], who had led the division for most of nothing , with winning streaks in June and July, coupled with a pair of dramatic, late-inning wins against the [[2007 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]], and ultimately clinched the NL Central with a record of 85–77.

The Cubs successfully defended their National League Central title in [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2008]], going to the postseason in consecutive years for the first time since 1906–08.

==2009–present: The Ricketts Era==
===2009===
{{Main|2009 Chicago Cubs season}}
Apparently handcuffed by Tribune's bankruptcy and the sale of the club to the Ricketts' family, the Cubs' quest for a NL Central 3-peat started with notice that there would be less invested into contracts than in previous years. Once again, however, trade speculation dominated the headlines at the winter meetings, this time surrounding Padres' ace [[Jake Peavy]], which, much like the Brian Roberts talks a year earlier, resulted in nothing. Piniella blamed the '08 post season failure on the lack of left-handed hitters, and a bevy of high caliber outfielders fit the bill. Ultimately, the club settled on inking oft-troubled switch hitter [[Milton Bradley (baseball)|Milton Bradley]] over [[Adam Dunn]], [[Raúl Ibáñez]], and [[Bobby Abreu]]. The bench and bullpen were also overhauled in a bevy of money saving moves, and fan favorites Kerry Wood and Mark DeRosa both left for the [[Cleveland Indians]]. [[Kevin Gregg]] was acquired from the Marlins to replace Wood, and [[Aaron Miles]] was signed to replace DeRosa.

Led by the strong play of [[Derrek Lee]], [[Ted Lilly]] and rookie pitcher [[Randy Wells]], the club started well, but fell on hard times as injuries took their toll. Nearly every key player suffered injury and the Northsiders struggled into the All Star break with a disappointing .500 record. [[Carlos Mármol]] eventually replaced Gregg as closer and the team stayed in the race, but they were distracted by Bradley, whose poor hitting and even poorer attitude became a major issue as the season progressed. Bradley complained about being heckled, booed and &quot;hated&quot; by bleacher fans and expressed his overall unhappiness in Chicago, eventually leading to a season ending suspension. Despite this, Chicago engaged St. Louis in a see-saw battle for first place into August, but the Cardinals played to a torrid 20–6 pace that month, designating their rivals to battle in the Wild Card race, from which they were eliminated in the season's final week. On the bright side, the Boys in Blue posted a winning record (83–78) for the third consecutive season, the first time the club had done so since 1972, and a new era of ownership under the Ricketts' family was approved by MLB owners in early October.

=== 2010: Lou Piniella retires ===
{{Main|2010 Chicago Cubs season}}
Milton Bradley was traded to [[Seattle Mariners|Seattle]] in the off-season, and was replaced by [[Marlon Byrd]] and [[Xavier Nady]] as Lou Piniella entered his fourth season with the team, who were expected to contend with St. Louis in the divisional race. Rookie [[Starlin Castro]] debuted in early May, as the starting shortstop. However, the club played poorly in the early season, finding themselves 10 games under .500 at the end of June. In addition, long-time ace Carlos Zambrano was pulled from a game against the White Sox on June 25 after a tirade and shoving match with Derrek Lee, and was suspended indefinitely by Jim Hendry, who called the conduct &quot;unacceptable.&quot;

On July 20, Piniella announced his retirement, effective at the end of the 2010 season.

On August 2, The Cubs tied a club record for most allowed hits in a single game. Cubs pitchers gave up a total of 26 hits in their 18 to 1 loss to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. The last time Cubs pitchers allowed 26 hits was back on September 2, 1957 against the [[Milwaukee Braves]]. The Cubs only recorded 4 hits and were out hit by [[Prince Fielder]] alone who had five hits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantagraph.com/sports/baseball/professional/mlb/chicago-cubs/article_99deaefa-9eb3-11df-b8ef-001cc4c002e0.html Pantagraph.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, Lou Piniella announced that he would leave the Cubs for the rest of the 2010 season to take care of his sick mother. Mike Quade took over as the interim manager for the final 37 games of the year. Despite being well out of playoff contention, during that 37 game stretch, the Cubs went 24–13 under Quade, posting the best record in baseball during that stretch. During these games, the Cubs got a chance to see what their roster would look like in 2011, by bringing up minor league players such as [[Darwin Barney]], [[Brad Snyder (baseball)|Brad Snyder]], [[Bobby Scales]], [[Welington Castillo]], [[Jeff Samardzija]], [[Micah Hoffpauir]], [[Scott Maine]], [[Marcos Mateo]], and [[Thomas Diamond]].

On October 19, Mike Quade was named the next Cubs manager. He has been given a two-year deal and a club option for 2013. On December 2, Cubs broadcaster and former third baseman, [[Ron Santo]], died due to complications from bladder cancer and diabetes, he spent 13 seasons with the Cubs, and is regarded as one of the greatest players not in the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/news/story?id=5703131 Sports.espn.go.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalries==
===St. Louis Cardinals===
{{main|Cardinals-Cubs rivalry}}
The '''Cardinals–Cubs rivalry''' refers to the [[Major League Baseball]] games between the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and the [[Chicago Cubs]]. The rivalry has been called one of the best and most historic in the [[National League]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/28/baseball-best-rivalries-lifestyle-sports-baseball_slide_5.html|title=In Depth: Baseball's Most Intense Rivalries|publisher=Forbes|first=Matt|last=Woolsey|date=April 28, 2009|accessdate=May 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also known as the '''I-55 series''' (or in earlier years the '''Route 66 series'''), deriving its name from the roadway connecting the two cities, [[Interstate 55]] (which itself succeeded the famous [[U.S. Route 66]]). The Cubs lead the series 1,092&amp;ndash;1,046 through {{mlby|2011}}, while the Cardinals lead in [[National League]] pennants with 17 against the Cubs' 16. However, the Cardinals have a clear edge when it comes to [[World Series]] successes, having won 10 championships to the Cubs' 2. Cardinals-Cubs games see numerous visiting fans in either St. Louis' [[Busch Stadium]] or Chicago's [[Wrigley Field]]. When the National League split into two, and then three divisions, the Cardinals and Cubs remained together. This has added excitement to several pennant races over the years, most recently in {{mlby|1989}} and {{mlby|2003}}.

==Retired numbers==
{{See also|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}
The Chicago Cubs retired numbers are commemorated on pinstriped flags flying from the foul poles at Wrigley Field, with the exception of [[Jackie Robinson]], the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] player whose number 42 was [[retired]] for all clubs. The first retired number flag, Ernie Banks' number 14, was raised on the left field pole, and they have alternated since then. 14, 10 and 31 (Jenkins) fly on the left field pole; and 26, 23 and 31 (Maddux) fly on the right field pole.

* There is also a movement to retire numbers for other players, most notably the uniform shirt of [[Gabby Hartnett]]. The Cubs first wore numbers on their shirts in 1932, and Hartnett wore #7 initially but switched to #9 for the next four seasons. From 1937–40 he wore #2, which is the number considered for retirement. Petitions have been sent in to the team for [[Cap Anson]] (shirt), [[Hack Wilson]] (shirt), [[Phil Cavarretta]] (3), [[Andre Dawson]] (8), and [[Mark Grace]] (17), as well as more recent departures [[Sammy Sosa]] (21), [[Kerry Wood]] (34), and [[Derrek Lee]] (25).

==Ownership==
{{Main|List of managers and owners of the Chicago Cubs}}

Al Spalding, who also owned [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] sporting goods, played for the team for two seasons under club founder William Hulbert. After Hulbert's death Spalding owned the club for twenty one years, after which the Cubs were purchased by Albert Lasker and Charles Weeghman. That pair were followed by the Wrigley family, owners of [[The Wrigley Company|Wrigley's]] chewing gum. In 1981, after 6 decades under the Wrigley family, the Cubs were purchased by [[Tribune Company]] for $20,500,000. Tribune, which also owned the ''Chicago Tribune'', ''Los Angeles Times'', ''WGN Television'', ''WGN Radio'' and many other media outlets, controlled the club until December 2007, when [[Sam Zell]] completed his purchase of the entire Tribune organization and announced his intention to sell the baseball team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ESPN.com|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2821964&amp;type=story|title=Prominent names mentioned as possible Cubs' buyers|accessdate=April 2, 2007|date=April 3, 2007|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Zell began what was basically a competition for a buyer. In late July, a long list was narrowed down to ten, and those ten prospective investors were then narrowed to three, all of whom offered over $1 billion for both the Cubs and Wrigley Field, with the presumptive fan favorites being outspoken [[Dallas Mavericks]] owner [[Mark Cuban]] and a group led by former announcer [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] and Hall-of-Famer [[Hank Aaron]]. However, the list inflated back to five by August as private equity investor and Brewers minority owner [[John Canning, Jr.]] and Tom Ricketts, the son of [[Ameritrade]] founder [[J. Joseph Ricketts|Joe Ricketts]] were added to the &quot;contest.&quot; The Canning move was highly scrutinized, because when Zell originally trimmed the candidates down, Canning Jr. had been eliminated, but commissioner [[Bud Selig]] had apparently picked him as a favorite of the fraternity of MLB owners. During a [[Chicago Bulls]]-Dallas Mavericks telecast on October 9, 2008, Cuban, in a courtside interview with Comcast Sports Net, claimed he had made the highest bid, and although he did not know where he stood, noted that the state of the economy would likely affect the time frame of the eventual sale. Nonetheless, on January 8, 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported that a new group of three finalists, [[Thomas S. Ricketts|Tom Ricketts]], Hersch Klaff, and a partnership of [[private equity]] investors Marc Utay and [[Leo Hindery Jr.]], were expected to submit polished offers &quot;within days,&quot; after which the winning bid would be accepted and, pending the winning bidders approval by 2/3 of the current MLB owners, &quot;would be final,&quot; with Zell holding on to a minor share of the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Moving parts' cloud Peavy deal|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 8, 2009|page=3|first=Fred|last=Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ricketts family won that bidding process as the 2009 season came to a close. Ultimately, the sale was unanimously approved by MLB owners and the Ricketts family took control on October 27, 2009.

==Media==
===Radio===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:WGN720.png|thumb|left|170px|WGN Radio logo]] --&gt;
{{Main|Pat and Ron Show}}
The Cubs' [[flagship]] [[radio station]] is [[WGN (AM)|WGN]]/720 AM. With the recent end of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]' run on [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]], this may now be the longest team-to-station relationship in MLB. [[Pat Hughes (baseball)|Pat Hughes]] did the [[play-by-play]] along with [[color commentator]] [[Ron Santo]] (until the latter's death in December 2010) and pre- and post-game host Judd Sirott; [[Keith Moreland]], a member of the 1984 Cubs, became Hughes's color man with the start of spring training in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/3855901-419/like-santo-new-cubs-announcer-wants-world-series.html | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes did play by play for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] prior to coming to Chicago, and Santo, a former Cubs star and a devout fan of the team (Hughes introduced Santo as &quot;Cub legend Ron Santo&quot; on a daily basis), was known for his emotional highs and lows during games. One example of a &quot;low&quot; was his &quot;Noooo! Noooo!&quot; when [[Brant Brown]] dropped a fly ball in a key game in 1998. A &quot;high&quot; for Santo was upon the retirement of his number on the last day of the 2003 season, in which he declared his #10 flag to be &quot;my Hall of Fame.&quot; Because Santo was a [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetic]] who had lost both his legs to the disease, most sponsors of the radio program centered their promotions around the [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]] and other diabetes-based charities. The [[Chicago Cubs Radio Network]] consists of 45 stations and covers at least [http://www.tribuneradio.com/cubsaffilliates.htm eleven states.] WGN Radio is owned and operated by Tribune Company.

===Television===
Cubs telecasts are locally aired on three different outlets: Over broadcast television via the WGN television outlets (both the [[WGN-TV|local station on Channel 9]] and the [[WGN America|superstation]] nationally), [[Weigel Broadcasting]]'s [[WCIU-TV]] (Channel 26.1) and on [[cable television]] over [[Comcast SportsNet Chicago|CSN Chicago]] (of which the Ricketts family owns a 20% interest), with some games, mainly on Wednesday evenings, airing over the supplemental CSN+ channel. WCIU came into the fold in the early 2000s due to demands by [[The WB Television Network]] for WGN to devote more time to the network's programming, and later on the same has been expected by [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], though WGN still does push back CW primetime programming to accommodate game broadcasts.

[[Len Kasper]] is the [[play-by-play]] announcer, and [[Bob Brenly]], a former major league catcher and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] manager, is the [[color commentator]] for the games. WGN also produces the games shown on WCIU; for those games, the score bug changes the &quot;WGN&quot; logo to &quot;CubsNet.&quot; WCIU games additionally air over [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[WMYS-LP]] (Channel 69) in the [[South Bend, Indiana]] market. WGN and CSN Chicago generally show an even number of Cubs games, while WCIU averages about 8 games per season.

In 2009, the Chicago Cubs expressed interest in creating their own regional cable network. Crane Kenney, the Cubs' president, said that a regional network owned by the Cubs would create additional revenue streams. The hope was that this would be similar to other successful regional sports networks such as the [[Yes network|YES Network]] and [[NESN]]. The only difference would be that the Cubs could not immediately broadcast Cubs games due to the existing contracts and/or ownership stakes in CSN Chicago, WGN-TV and WCIU-TV. According to Kenney, the new Cubs network would be like the [[MLB Network]], but showing Cubs-only programming. Classic Cubs games from the past could be scheduled as well as in-depth specials. Live telecasts of the minor league affiliate [[Iowa Cubs]] games were also being considered (when there are no Cubs games scheduled or available due to contract agreements).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/sports/Cubs-Could-Have-Own-Television-Network-Soon.html Cubs Could Have Own Television Network Soon]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Print===
In addition to ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' itself, the club also produces its own print media; the Cubs' official magazine [http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/fan_forum/vineline.jsp ''Vineline''], which has 12 annual issues, is in its third decade, and spotlights players and events involving the club.

===Jack Brickhouse and Harry Caray===
[[File:Harry Carey.jpg|thumb|left|200px|right|Harry Caray memorialized in a statue near [[Wrigley Field]] in [[Chicago]].]]
Two broadcasters in particular have made their mark on the team. [[Jack Brickhouse]] manned the Cubs radio and especially the TV booth for parts of five decades, the 34-season span from 1948 to 1981. He covered the games with a level of enthusiasm that often seemed unjustified by the team's poor performance on the field for many of those years. His trademark call ''&quot;Hey Hey!&quot;'' always followed a home run. That expression is spelled out in large letters vertically on both foul pole screens at Wrigley Field. &quot;Whoo-boy!&quot; and &quot;Wheeee!&quot; and &quot;Oh, brother!&quot; were among his other pet expressions. When he approached retirement age, he personally recommended his successor.

[[Harry Caray]]'s stamp on the team is perhaps even deeper than that of Brickhouse, although his 17-year tenure, from 1982 to 1997, was half as long. First, Caray had already become a well-known Chicago figure by broadcasting White Sox games for a decade, after having been a St Louis Cardinals icon for 25 years. Caray also had the benefit of being in the booth during the NL East title run in 1984, which was widely seen due to WGN's status as a cable-TV superstation. His trademark call of ''&quot;Holy Cow!&quot;'' and his enthusiastic singing of &quot;''Take me out to the ballgame''&quot; during the 7th inning stretch (as he had done with the White Sox) made Caray a fan favorite both locally and nationally. Harry occasionally had problems pronouncing names, to comic effect, such as his attempt at saying &quot;[[Hector Villanueva]]&quot; which was captured on WGN's memorial CD to Harry. He also continued his long-standing bit (dating back to the Cardinals years) of pronouncing names backwards. Caray had lively discussions with commentator [[Steve Stone (baseball player)|Steve Stone]], who was hand-picked by Harry himself, and producer [[Arne Harris]]. Caray often playfully quarreled with Stone over Stone's cigar and why Stone was single, while Stone would counter with poking fun at Harry being &quot;under the influence.&quot; Stone disclosed in his book &quot;''Where's Harry''&quot; that most of this &quot;arguing&quot; was staged, and usually a ploy developed by Harry himself to add flavor to the broadcast. Additionally, Harry once did a commercial for [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], dressed as a &quot;Blues Brother&quot; and parodying &quot;Soul Man&quot;, singing &quot;I'm a Cub fan, I'm a Bud man,&quot; while dancing with models dressed as Cubs [[ball boy|ball girls]].

The Cubs still have a &quot;guest conductor,&quot; usually a celebrity, lead the crowd in singing &quot;Take me out to the ballgame&quot; during the 7th inning stretch to honor Caray's memory. The quality of their renditions and ability to sing in tune vary widely. Chicago icons often return annually, such as former [[Chicago Bears]] coach [[Mike Ditka]], who tends to sing the song very fast and worse than awful. Caray is also honored with a statue located at the corner of Sheffield and Addison street. During the 1998 season, a permanent window with Caray's caricature was installed in the Wrigley Field broadcast booth, and a patch with the same caricature along with Brickhouse's trademark ''&quot;Hey Hey&quot;'' were worn on the players sleeves to honor the passing of both commentators within a span of a few months. Harry's popularity also led to his grandson [[Chip Caray]] joining the broadcast team in winter of 1997, shortly before Harry's death. Chip Caray worked the Cubs games alongside Stone until events that unfolded in 2004, when Stone became increasingly critical of management and players toward season's end. At one point, reliever [[Kent Mercker]] phoned the booth during a game and told Stone to &quot;keep out of team business.&quot; Stone left the team, taking a position with Chicago-based [[WSCR]], and is now an announcer for the south side team, the Chicago White Sox. Chip Caray also left, joining his father [[Skip Caray]] (who would die in 2008) on [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]], providing play-by-play for the [[Atlanta Braves]].

==Memorable events and records==
===Merkle's &quot;Boner&quot;===
[[File:Cap Anson WSP 19080422.JPG|thumb|right|[[West Side Grounds]] served as the club's home for nearly 30 years]]On September 23, 1908, the Cubs and [[1908 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] were involved in a tight pennant race. The two clubs were tied in the bottom of the ninth inning at the [[Polo Grounds]], and N.Y. had runners on first and third and two outs when [[Al Bridwell]] singled, scoring [[Moose McCormick]] from third with the Giants' apparent winning run, but the runner on first base, rookie [[Fred Merkle]], went half way to second and then sprinted to the clubhouse after McCormick touched home plate. As fans swarmed the field, Cub infielder [[Johnny Evers]] retrieved the ball and touched second. Since there were 2 outs, a forceout was called at second base, ending the inning and the game. Because of the tie the Giants and Cubs ended up tied for first place. The Giants lost the ensuing one-game playoff and the Cubs went on to the [[1908 World Series|World Series]].

===The Homer in the Gloamin'===
On September 28, 1938, with the Cubs and Pirates tied at 5, [[Gabby Hartnett]] stepped to the plate in a lightless Wrigley Field that was gradually being overcome by darkness and visibility was becoming difficult. With two outs in the bottom of the ninth and the umpires ready to end the game, Hartnett launched Pirate hurler [[Mace Brown]]'s offering into the gloom and haze. This would be remembered as his &quot;''Homer in the Gloamin.''&quot;

===Rick Monday and the U.S. flag===
[[File:Rick Monday American Flag.jpg|thumb|right|Veteran [[U.S. Marine|Marine]] Rick Monday grabs a [[American flag|U.S. flag]] from protesters.]]On April 25, 1976, at Dodger Stadium, two protestors ran into the outfield and tried to set fire to a [[American flag|U.S. flag]]. When Cubs outfielder [[Rick Monday]] noticed the flag on the ground and the men fumbling with matches and lighter fluid, he dashed over and snatched the flag to thunderous applause. When he came up to bat in the next half-inning, he got a standing ovation from the crowd and the stadium titantron flashed the message, &quot;RICK MONDAY... YOU MADE A GREAT PLAY...&quot; Monday later said, &quot;If you're going to burn the flag, don't do it around me. I've been to too many veterans' hospitals and seen too many broken bodies of guys who tried to protect it.&quot;&lt;ref name=flag&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060424&amp;content_id=1415977&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc|title=Monday's act heroic after 30 years|publisher=mlb.com|first=Ben|last=Platt|date=April 25, 2006|work=cubs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sandberg game===
{{Main|Ryne Sandberg#&quot;The Sandberg Game&quot;|l1=The Sandberg Game}}
On June 23, 1984, [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago]] trailed [[1984 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]] 9–8 in the bottom of the ninth on [[NBC Sports|NBC]]'s [[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Game of the Week]] when [[Ryne Sandberg]], known mostly for his glove, slugged a game-tying [[home run]] off ace closer [[Bruce Sutter]]. Despite this, the Cardinals scored two runs in the top of the tenth. Sandberg came up again facing [[Bruce Sutter]] with one man on base, and hit yet another game tying home run, and ''Ryno'' became a household name. The Cubs won what has become known as &quot;''The Sandberg Game''&quot; in the 11th inning.

===10,000th win===
[[File:10,000 Commemoration.jpg|thumb|right|165px|The organization commemorating 10,000 wins]]On April 23, 2008, against the [[Colorado Rockies]], the Cubs recorded the 10,000th regular-season win in their franchise's history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores108/108114/MLB798321.htm|work=USATODAY.com|publisher=USA Today|date=April 23, 2008|title=Cubs get 10,000th win|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; dating back to the beginning of the National League in 1876. The Cubs reached the milestone with an overall National League record of 10,000 wins and 9,465 losses. Chicago is only the second club in Major League Baseball history to attain this milestone, the first having been the [[San Francisco Giants]] in mid-season 2005. The Cubs, however, hold the mark for victories for a team in a single city. The Chicago club's 77–77 record in the National Association (1871, 1874–1875) is not included in MLB record keeping. Post-season series are also not included in the totals. To honor the milestone, the Cubs flew an extra white flag displaying &quot;10,000&quot; in blue, along with the customary &quot;W&quot; flag.

===Tape-measure home runs===
[[File:Wrigley Manuel Scoreboard 2009.JPG|thumb|left|Wrigley Field's famous manual scoreboard in center field]] On May 11, 2000, [[Glenallen Hill]], facing Brewers starter [[Steve Woodard]], became the first, and thus far only player, to hit a pitched ball onto the roof of a five-story residential building across Waveland Ave, beyond Wrigley Field's left field wall. The shot was estimated at well over {{convert|500|ft|m}}, but the Cubs fell to Milwaukee 12–8.

No batted ball has ever hit the center field scoreboard in Wrigley Field, although the original &quot;Slammin' Sammy&quot;, golfer [[Sam Snead]], hit it with a golf ball in an exhibition in the 1950s. In 1948, [[Bill Nicholson (baseball)|Bill Nicholson]] barely missed the scoreboard when he launched a home run ball onto Sheffield Avenue and in 1959, [[Roberto Clemente]] came even closer with a&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/stadium/wrigley_field.shtml Baseball-almanac.com]&lt;/ref&gt; home run ball hit onto Waveland Avenue. In 2001, a Sammy Sosa homer landed across Waveland and bounced a block down Kenmore Avenue. [[Dave Kingman]] hit a shot in 1978 that hit the third porch roof on the east side of Kenmore, which was estimated at {{convert|555|ft|m}}, and is regarded as the longest home run in Wrigley Field history.

===Mascots===
[[File:CHC-MLB-alternate.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Cubbie-Bear mascot]]
{{See also|List of Major League Baseball mascots#Teams without a mascot}}
The official Cub [[mascot]] is a young bear cub, which has gone through various transformations through the years. The Cubs have no official physical mascot, though a man in a 'polar bear' looking outfit, called &quot;The Beeman&quot; (or Bearman, B-man), which was not very popular with the fans, was employed by the club briefly in the early 1990s.

===''&quot;White flag time at Wrigley!&quot;''===
The term ''&quot;[[Cubs Win Flag|White flag]] time at Wrigley!&quot;'', coined by former play-by-play broadcaster Chip Caray, means the Cubs have won.

Beginning in the days of P.K. Wrigley and the 1937 bleacher/scoreboard reconstruction, and prior to modern media saturation, a flag with either a &quot;W&quot; or an &quot;L&quot; has flown from atop the scoreboard masthead, indicating the day's result(s) when baseball was played at Wrigley. In case of a doubleheader that results in a split, both the &quot;win&quot; and &quot;loss&quot; flags are flown.

Past Cubs media guides show that originally the flags were blue with a white &quot;W&quot; and white with a blue &quot;L&quot;. In 1978, consistent with the dominant colors of the flags, blue and white lights were mounted atop the scoreboard, denoting &quot;win&quot; and &quot;loss&quot; respectively for the benefit of nighttime passers-by.

The flags were replaced by 1990, the first year in which the Cubs media guide reports the switch to the now familiar colors of the flags: White with blue &quot;W&quot; and blue with white &quot;L&quot;. In addition to needing to replace the worn-out flags, by then the retired numbers of Banks and Williams were flying on the foul poles, as white with blue numbers; so the &quot;good&quot; flag was switched to match that scheme.

This long-established tradition has evolved to fans carrying the white-with-blue-W flags to both home and away games, and displaying them after a Cub win. The flags have become more and more popular each season since 1998, and are now even sold as T-shirts with the same layout. In 2009, the tradition spilled over to the [[NHL]] as [[Chicago Blackhawks]] fans adopted a red and black &quot;W&quot; flag of their own.

===Wrigley Field and Wrigleyville===
The Cubs have played their home games at [[Wrigley Field]], also known as ''&quot;The Friendly Confines&quot;'' since 1916. It was built in 1914 as '''Weeghman Park''' for the [[Chicago Whales]], a '''[[Federal League]]''' baseball team. The Cubs also shared the park with the [[Chicago Bears]] of the NFL for 50 years. The ballpark includes a manual scoreboard, ivy-covered brick walls, and relatively small dimensions.

Located in Chicago's [[Lake View, Chicago|Lake View]] neighborhood, Wrigley Field sits on an irregular block bounded by Clark and Addison Streets and Waveland and Sheffield Avenues. The area surrounding the ballpark is typically referred to as Wrigleyville. There is a dense collection of sports bars and restaurants in the area, most with baseball inspired themes, including Sluggers, Murphy's Bleachers and [[The Cubby Bear]]. Many of the apartment buildings surrounding Wrigley Field on Waveland and Sheffield Avenues have built bleachers on their [[Wrigley Rooftops|rooftops]] for fans to view games. On game days, many residents rent out their yards and driveways to people looking for parking spots.

===Bleacher Bums===
The &quot;[[Bleacher Bums]]&quot; is a name given to fans, many of whom spend much of the day heckling, who sit in the bleacher section at Wrigley Field. Initially, the group was called &quot;bums&quot; because it referred to a group of fans who were at most games, and since those games were all day games, it was assumed they did not work. Many of those fans were, and are still, students at Chicago area colleges, such as [[DePaul University]], [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola]], [[Northwestern University]], and [[University of Illinois at Chicago|Illinois-Chicago]]. A [http://www.moviecitynews.com/Interviews/santo.html Broadway play], starring [[Joe Mantegna]], [[Dennis Farina]], [[Dennis Franz]], and [[James Belushi]] ran for years and was based on a group of Cub fans who frequented the club's games. The group was started in 1967 by dedicated fan Ron Grousl and &quot;mad bugler&quot; [[Mike Murphy (sports radio personality)|Mike Murphy]], who was a sports radio host during mid days on Chicago-based [[WSCR]] AM 670 &quot;The Score&quot;. Murphy alleges that Grousl started the Wrigley tradition of throwing back opposing teams' home run balls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chitownradio.com/messages/606.html Excerpt from ''Miracle Collapse: The 1969 Chicago Cubs'', Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chitownradio.com/messages/606.html WSCR's Murphy and Cubs ball-throwing]&lt;/ref&gt; The current group is headed by Derek Schaul. More recently, the bleachers have had the stereotype of being populated by attractive and lightly dressed women. Prior to the 2006 season, they were updated, with new shops and private bar (The Batter's Eye) being added, and [[Bud Light]] bought naming rights to the bleacher section, dubbing them the '''Bud Light Bleachers'''. Bleachers at Wrigley are general admission.

===Music===
During the summer of 1969, a Chicago studio group produced a single record called &quot;Hey Hey!  Holy Mackerel! (The Cubs Song)&quot; whose title and lyrics incorporated the catch-phrases of the respective TV and radio announcers for the Cubs, [[Jack Brickhouse]] and [[Vince Lloyd]]. Several members of the Cubs recorded an album called ''Cub Power'' which contained a cover of the song. The song received a good deal of local airplay that summer, associating it very strongly with that bittersweet season. It was played much less frequently thereafter, although it remained an unofficial Cubs theme song for some years after.

For many years, Cubs radio broadcasts started with &quot;It's a Beautiful Day for a Ball Game&quot; by the Harry Simeone Chorale. In 1979, Roger Bain released a 45 rpm record of his song &quot;Thanks Mr. Banks,&quot; to honor “Mr. Cub” Ernie Banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerbaindemo.com/|title=RogerBaindemo.com|publisher=rogerbaindemo.com|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song &quot;[[Go, Cubs, Go|Go, Cubs, Go!]]&quot; by [[Steve Goodman]] was recorded early in the 1984 season, and was heard frequently during that season. Goodman died in September of that year, four days before the Cubs clinched the National League Eastern Division title, their first title in 39 years. Since 1984, the song started being played from time to time at [[Wrigley Field]]; since 2007, the song has been played over the loudspeakers following each Cubs home victory.

In 2007, [[Pearl Jam]] frontman [[Eddie Vedder]] composed a song dedicated to the team called &quot;[[All the Way (Eddie Vedder song)|All the Way]]&quot;. Vedder, a Chicago native, and lifelong Cubs fan, composed the song at the request of Ernie Banks.
Pearl Jam has only played this song live one time, on August 2, 2007 at the Vic Theater in Chicago, IL.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pearljam.com/song/all-way|title=All The Way|publisher=Pearl Jam|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eddie Vedder has played this song live twice, at his solo shows at the Chicago Auditorium on August 21 and 22, 2008.

An album entitled ''Take Me Out to a Cubs Game'' was released in 2008. It is a collection of 17 songs and other recordings related to the team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takemeouttoacubsgame.com/default.htm |title=Take Me Out to a Cubs Game Chicago cubs music CD |publisher=Takemeouttoacubsgame.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080603082749/http://www.takemeouttoacubsgame.com/default.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Harry Caray]]'s final performance of &quot;[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]&quot; on September 21, 1997, the Steve Goodman song mentioned above, and a newly-recorded rendition of &quot;[[Talkin' Baseball]]&quot; (subtitled &quot;Baseball and the Cubs&quot;) by [[Terry Cashman]]. The album was produced in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Cubs' [[1908 World Series]] victory and contains sounds and songs of the Cubs and Wrigley Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EVMRDM|title='Take Me Out To A Cubs Game' Music CD|accessdate=2008-11-26|year=2008|publisher=[[Amazon.com, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TMOTACGC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cubhub.net/Cubs-Music/|title=Take Me Out To A Cubs Game CD|accessdate=2008-11-26|year=2008|publisher=CubHub.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Championship drought===
[[File:Thestapletookthisonbartmanday.JPG|thumb|left|185px|The Cubs were as few as 5 outs from the World Series in 2003]]
The Chicago Cubs have not won a World Series championship since 1908 and have not appeared in the Fall Classic since 1945, although between their postseason appearance in 1984 and their most recent in 2008, they have made the postseason a respectable six times. It is the longest title drought in all four of the major [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|American professional sports leagues]], which includes the [[National Football League|NFL]], [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], [[National Hockey League|NHL]], as well as [[Major League Baseball]]. In fact, the Cubs' last World Series title occurred before those other three leagues even existed, and even the Cubs' last World Series appearance predates the founding of the NBA. The Cubs' 3–2 series victory over the [[2003 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in the 2003 NLDS was the franchise's first postseason series win since the 1908 championship.

==Spring training history==
The Cubs spring training facility is located in [[Mesa, Arizona]], where they play in the [[Cactus League]]. The club plays its games at [[HoHoKam Park]], Dwight Patterson Field. &quot;HoHoKam&quot; is literally translated from Native American as &quot;those who vanished.&quot; The park seats just under 13,567, and the Cubs annually sell out most of their games both at home and on the road. The Northsiders have called Mesa their spring home for most seasons since 1952. In addition to Mesa, the club has held spring training in [[Champaign, Illinois]] (1901–02, 1906); Los Angeles (1903–04, 1948–1949), [[Santa Monica, California]] (1905); New Orleans (1907, 1911–1912); Vicksburg, Miss. (1908); [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] (1909–1910); Tampa (1913–1916); Pasadena, Cal. (1917–1921); [[Santa Catalina Island, California]] (1922–1942, 1946–1947, 1950–1951); [[French Lick, Indiana]] (1943–1945); Mesa (1952–1965, 1979–present); [[Long Beach, California]] (1966); and [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] (1967–1978).

The curious location on Catalina Island stemmed from Cubs owner William Wrigley Jr.'s then-majority interest in the island in 1919. Wrigley constructed a ballpark on the island to house the Cubs in spring training: it was built to the same dimensions as Wrigley Field. (The ballpark is long gone, but a clubhouse built by Wrigley to house the Cubs exists as the Catalina County Club.) However by 1951 the team chose to leave Catalina Island and spring training was shifted to Mesa, Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springtrainingonline.com/teams/chicago_cubs.htm Spring Training Online History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubs' 30-year association with Catalina is chronicled in the book, ''The Cubs on Catalina,'' by [[Jim Vitti]] . . . which was named International 'Book of the Year' by ''[[The Sporting News]]''.

The current location in Mesa is actually the second HoHoKam Park; the first was built in 1976 as the spring-training home of the Oakland Athletics who left the park in 1979. Apart from HoHoKam Park the Cubs also have another Mesa training facility called Fitch Park, this complex provides {{convert|25000|sqft|m2}} of team facilities, including major league clubhouse, four practice fields, one practice infield, enclosed batting tunnels, batting cages, a maintenance facility, and administrative offices for the Cubs.

The practice of teams traveling for organized spring training practice games and drills is almost as old as baseball itself. One of the earliest recorded spring training camps took place in 1870, when the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] and the Chicago White Stockings (now the Cubs) held organized baseball camps in New Orleans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Their signature style is [[electronic dance music]], featuring [[cut-up technique|cut up]] samples of hip hop, breaks, jazz, spoken word and various other types of music, as well as video and [[multimedia]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}

===1980s===
In 1986, computer programmer Matt Black and ex-[[art teacher]] Jonathan More were part time [[DJ]]s on the [[rare groove]] scene. More also DJed on [[pirate radio]], hosting the ''Meltdown Show'' on [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss FM]] and worked at the Reckless Records store on [[Berwick Street]], [[London]] where Black visited as a customer. Black had created a [[mixtape]] for a [[Capital Radio]] mix competition. He played the tape to More who suggested a separate edit be made of part of the mix. Black had mixed the [[Jungle Book]]'s &quot;King of the Swingers&quot; with the break from [[James Brown]]'s &quot;Funky Drummer&quot;. This was the start of a collaboration that was released as [[Say_Kids_What_Time_Is_It%3F|Say Kids, What Time Is It?]] on a [[white label]] in January 1987.

Later in the year, after Black joined Kiss FM with his own mix-based show, the pair eventually joined forces for their own show, ''[[Solid Steel]]''. During the year, the duo adopted the name Coldcut and set up a record label, &quot;Ahead of Our Time&quot;, to release the single &quot;Beats + Pieces&quot; (one of the formats also included &quot;That Greedy Beat&quot;). All of these tracks were made by the assembly of spliced tape edits that would sometimes run &quot;all over the room&quot;. The duo used sampling from [[Led Zeppelin]] to [[James Brown]].

Coldcut's first mainstream success came when a representative from [[Island Records]] asked them to remix [[hip hop]] duo [[Eric B. &amp; Rakim]]'s &quot;Paid in Full&quot;. The remix featured a prominent [[Ofra Haza]] [[Sampling (music)|sample]] and many other vocal cut ups as well as a looped rhythm which, when speeded up, became a staple{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} of the [[breakbeats]] genre. After it proved popular in the clubs,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} this Coldcut &quot;Seven Minutes of Madness&quot; remix ended up being promoted as the single in the UK. Released in October 1987, it became a breakthrough hit for Eric B &amp; Rakim outside the U.S., reaching #15 in the UK and the top 20 in a number of European countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} It was voted [[remix]] of the year and is now regarded{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} as both a hip hop classic and a breakthrough in the remix field. This remix was itself sampled in the remix of &quot;[[Pump Up the Volume (song)|Pump Up the Volume]]&quot; by [[MARRS]] that reached #1 in the UK, also in October 1987.

The next Coldcut single, released in February 1988, was &quot;Doctorin' the House&quot;, featuring singer [[Yazz]]. It became a top ten hit, peaking at #6. In the same year, under the guise Yazz and the Plastic Population, they produced &quot;[[The Only Way Is Up]]&quot;, a cover of a [[Northern Soul]] song. The record reached #1 in the UK in August. The duo had another UK Top 30 hit in September with &quot;Stop This Crazy Thing&quot; which featured reggae vocalist [[Junior Reid]].

The single &quot;[[People Hold On]]&quot; became another UK Top 20 hit. Released in March 1989, it featured the then relatively unknown singer [[Lisa Stansfield]]. Coldcut and [[Mark Saunders]] produced her debut solo single &quot;[[This Is the Right Time]]&quot; which became another UK Top 20 hit in August as well as reaching #21 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]] the following year.

Their debut album ''What's That Noise?'' was released in April 1989 on Ahead of Our Time and distributed by Big Life Records. As well as the guest vocalists from the singles, the album featured the fictional [[The Jetsons|George Jetson]] and [[Mark E Smith]]. The U.S. version was distributed by [[Tommy Boy Records]] and featured Tommy Boy artist [[Queen Latifah]] rapping over the (previously instrumental) track &quot;Smoke This One&quot;. Latifah's rap was decidedly anti-drug,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} while Coldcut's reggae dub-ish instrumental had tongue-in-cheek connotations of marijuana{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} appreciation by virtue of its title. The album reached the Top 20 in the UK and was [[Music recording sales certification|certified]] Silver.

===1990s===
Coldcut's second album, ''Some Like It Cold'' released in 1990, featured another collaboration with [[Queen Latifah]] on the single &quot;Find a Way&quot;. This album failed to chart and, though &quot;Find a Way&quot; was a minor hit in the UK, no more singles were released. The duo were given the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]]'s &quot;Producer of the Year Award&quot; in 1990.

After their success with Lisa Stansfield, her label [[Arista Records|Arista]] offered Coldcut a deal. They signed to the major label but their unwillingness to be moulded and promoted as a major act caused conflict.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Eventually, the album ''Philosophy'' emerged in 1993. Singles &quot;Dreamer&quot; and &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; (1994) were both minor hits but the album did not chart.

During this time, whilst touring [[Japan]], they conceived and started their second [[record label]], [[Ninja Tune]], which continues to release diverse music by like-minded artists. The name Coldcut however stayed with Arista so there were no official Coldcut releases for the next three years. During this time, they still produced prolifically for artists on their new label as well as continuing ''Solid Steel'' on Kiss FM, running the night club ''Stealth'' (Club of the Year in the ''[[New Musical Express|NME]]'', ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'', and ''[[Mixmag]]'' in 1996) and multimedia work with [[Hex (VJ group)|Hex]]. They compiled ''[[Journeys by DJ]] - 70 Minutes of Madness'' in 1996 which was voted &quot;Best Compilation of All Time&quot; by [[Jockey Slut]] in 1998.

In February 1997, with the legal right to the Coldcut name back, they released a double pack single &quot;Atomic Moog 2000&quot; / &quot;Boot the System&quot;, the first Coldcut release on Ninja Tune. This was not eligible for the UK chart because of time and format restrictions. A reworking of the early track &quot;More Beats + Pieces&quot; gave them their first UK Top 40 hit since 1989 in August. The album ''[[Let Us Play!]]'' followed in September and also made the Top 40. Videos were made for most songs, often by [[Hexstatic]], and used a lot of stock footage. Songs often used the audio from the videos as samples incorporated into the music, such as with the songs &quot;Timber&quot; (released as a single in 1998) and &quot;Pan Opticon&quot;. Also in 1997, Black created [[video scratching|real-time video manipulation]] software, ''VJamm''. Coldcut's live and DJ sets now relied on video as much as music. Their ''CCTV'' live show was featured at major festivals including [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]], [[Sónar]], the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]], and [[John Peel]]'s Meltdown.

In 1999, the remix album ''Let Us Replay!'' was released. The CD of the album also contained the ''VJamm'' software.

===2000s===
[[Image:Coldcut april2006.jpg|thumb|Coldcut in 2006]]
In 2000, the ''Solid Steel'' show moved to BBC London. Collaborations continued including 2001's &quot;Re:volution&quot; with The Guilty Party in 2001. In 2003, Black worked with [[Penny Rimbaud]] (ex [[Crass]]) on [[Crass Agenda]]'s ''Savage Utopia'' project.

Coldcut returned with the single &quot;Everything Is Under Control&quot; at the end of 2005, followed in 2006 by their fifth studio album ''[[Sound Mirrors]]''. A small world tour commenced with U.K. rapper [[Juice Aleem]] hosting the events. Three further singles were released from the album including the Top 75 hit &quot;True Skool&quot; with [[Roots Manuva]]. The same track appeared in the [[soundtrack]] of the [[videogame]] [[FIFA Street 2]]. This track features an Indian sample from a cult [[Bollywood]] era making the track popular on the [[bhangra]] and [[desi]] scene and with much of British Asian urban culture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Style==
Conceptually, Coldcut owes as much to the ideas of [[Beat generation|beat writer]] and cut-up theorist [[William S. Burroughs]], 1970s art / [[Industrial music|industrial]] group [[Throbbing Gristle]], the religious writings of [[J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs]] from the [[Church of the SubGenius]], and the paranoid rants of [[Francis E. Dec]],&lt;ref&gt;Micallef, Ken (2006). [http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_coldcut/index.html &quot;Coldcut&quot;], ''[[Remix Magazine]]'', remixmag.com, 1 January 2006: &quot;Inspired by the paranoid rants of Hempstead, N.Y.'s Francis E. Dec, the innovative DJ duo Coldcut produced “Everything Is Under Control,” the first single from ''Sound Mirrors'' (Ninja Tune, 2006). “Dec wrote these dreadful polemics that are insane but also have a certain spine-chilling truth,” Coldcut's Matt Black says, explaining the song's genesis. With Dec in mind, Black and his Coldcut partner, Jonathan More, wrote lyrics [...]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/Coldcut-Everything-Is-Under-Control/release/567109 ''Everything Is Under Control''] (2005) at [[Discogs]]: &quot;inspired by [...] the Mad Deadly Computer Gangster Godpoems of Francis E Dec, RIP&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; as they do to [[Hip hop music|Hip Hop]] originators like [[Grandmaster Flash]] or later innovators [[Double Dee and Steinski]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

&lt;!--(To be sourced or deleted.) Considering a presence of Burroughs' [[cut-up technique]] in [[hip hop music]], Moore and Black have pushed the [[DIY ethic|D.I.Y.]] ethic and an understanding of play as a means of fostering greater interaction with and understanding of the world. The similarities between this ethos and that of [[Hacker (free and open source software)|hacking]] need hardly be stated.--&gt;Ninja Tune uses a corporate facade to communicate via the marketplace itself, an idea first implemented by Throbbing Gristle via their own [[Industrial Records]] imprint.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

One of the key aspects of the Ninja Tune ethos, stealth, implies that their following of DJs and listeners are &quot;agents&quot; in a [[William S. Burroughs|Burroughs]]ian sense, propagating the [[DIY ethic]] of play as an essentially subversive act by replaying and manipulating media under the radar of mainstream culture.

Coldcut also credit their influence(s) from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop as described in the BBC7 Radio Programme - Selected Radiophonic Works. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Recent work==
In 2008, Coldcut remixed &quot;Ourselves&quot;, a Japanese #1 hit from the single &quot;[[&amp; (song)|&amp;]]&quot; by [[Ayumi Hamasaki]]. This mix was included on the album ''[[Ayu-mi-x 6: Gold]]''.

Coldcut also collaborated with [[mashup (video)|video mashup]] artist TV Sheriff, to produce &quot;Revolution '08&quot;, a [[drum and bass]] music video composed of footage from the [[United States presidential election, 2008|U.S. presidential election of 2008]].

'''Cuisine''' (from [[French language|French]] ''cuisine'', &quot;cooking; culinary art; kitchen&quot;; ultimately from [[Latin]] ''coquere'', &quot;to cook&quot;) is a specific set of [[cooking]] traditions and practices, often associated with a specific [[culture]]. It is often named after the region or place where its underlining culture is present. A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade. [[Religion|Religious]] food laws can also exercise a strong influence on cuisine.

== History ==
The foods and methods of preparation traditional to a region or population. The major factors shaping a cuisine are climate, which in large measure determines the native raw materials that are available to the cook; economic conditions, which regulate trade in delicacies and imported foodstuffs; and religious or sumptuary laws, under which certain foods are required or proscribed.

Climate also affects the supply of fuel; the characteristic Chinese food preparation methods, in which food is cut into small pieces before being cooked, was shaped primarily by the need to cook food quickly to conserve scarce firewood and charcoal. Foods preserved for winter consumption by smoking, curing, and pickling have remained important in world cuisines for their altered gustatory properties even when these preserving techniques are no longer strictly necessary to the maintenance of an adequate food supply.

World cuisine is traditionally divided into regions according to the common use of major foodstuffs, especially grains and cooking fats. In Central and South America, corn (maize), both fresh and dried, is the staple. In northern Europe, wheat, rye, and fats of animal origin predominate, while in southern Europe olive oil is ubiquitous and rice becomes important. In Italy the cuisine of the north, featuring butter and rice, stands in contrast to that of the south, with its wheat pasta and olive oil. China likewise can be divided into rice regions and noodle &amp; bread regions. Throughout the Middle East and Mediterranean there is a common thread marking the use of lamb, olive oil, lemons, peppers, and rice. The vegetarianism practiced in much of India has made [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]] such as chickpeas and lentils as important as wheat or rice. From India to Indonesia the lavish use of spices is characteristic; coconuts and seafood are used throughout the region both as foodstuffs and as seasonings.
