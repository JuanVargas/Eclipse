ulty, who denied Wilson said this and also claims that &quot;the President was entirely unaware of the nature of the play before it was presented and at no time has expressed his approbation of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from J. M. Tumulty, secretary to President Wilson, to the Boston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, quoted in Link, ''Wilson''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Woodrow Wilson's ''History of the American People'' explained the Ku Klux Klan of the late 1860s as the natural outgrowth of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], a lawless reaction to a lawless period. Wilson noted that the Klan &quot;began to attempt by intimidation what they were not allowed to attempt by the ballot or by any ordered course of public action.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Wilson, A History of the American People (1931) V:59.&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, approbation for the Klan, citing Wilson's History, is directly quoted.

Relentless in publicizing the film, Dixon was apparently the source for the quotation.  It has been repeated so often in print that it has taken on a separate life.  Dixon went so far as to promote the film as &quot;Federally endorsed&quot;.  After controversy over the film had grown, Wilson wrote that he disapproved of the &quot;unfortunate production.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Wilson to Joseph P. Tumulty, April 28, 1915 in Wilson, ''Papers'', 33:86.&lt;/ref&gt; D. W. Griffith responded to the film's negative critical reception with his next film ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]''.

In 1918 Emmett J. Scott helped produce and John W. Noble directed ''[[The Birth of a Race]]'' in response. Also in 1919, director/producer/writer [[Oscar Micheaux]] released ''[[Within Our Gates]]'', another response.  Notably, he reversed a key scene of Griffith's film by depicting a white man assaulting a black woman.

==Ideology and accuracy==
[[Image:Wilson-quote-in-birth-of-a-nation.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Woodrow Wilson]]'s ''History of the American People'' is quoted in ''The Birth of a Nation''.]]
The film is controversial due to its interpretation of history. [[University of Houston]] historian Steven Mintz summarizes its message as follows: [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was a disaster, blacks could never be [[racial integration|integrated]] into white society as equals, and the violent actions of the Ku Klux Klan were justified to reestablish honest government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/slaveryfilm.cfm UG.edu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Digital History.&lt;/ref&gt; The film suggested that the Ku Klux Klan restored order to the post-war South, which was depicted as endangered by abolitionists, freedmen, and [[carpetbagger|carpetbagging]] [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] politicians from the North. This reflects the so-called [[Dunning School]] of historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes 2007, pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and other black historians vigorously disputed this interpretation when the film was released.  Most historians of all backgrounds today agree with Du Bois, as they note [[African American]]s' loyalty and contributions during the Civil War years and Reconstruction, including the establishment of universal public education. Some historians, such as [[E. Merton Coulter]] in his ''The South Under Reconstruction'' (1947), maintained the Dunning School view after [[World War II]].  Today the Dunning School position is largely seen as a product of anti-black racism of the early twentieth century, by which many Americans held that black Americans were unequal as citizens.

Veteran film reviewer [[Roger Ebert]] wrote,
{{cquote|... stung by criticisms that the second half of his masterpiece was racist in its glorification of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and its brutal images of blacks, Griffith tried to make amends in ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), which criticized prejudice. And in ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' he told perhaps the first [[miscegenation|interracial love]] story in the movies--even though, to be sure, it's an idealized love with no touching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000123/REVIEWS08/1230301/1023 SunTimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite some similarities between the Congressman Stoneman character and  Rep. [[Thaddeus Stevens]] of [[Pennsylvania]], Rep. Stevens did not have the family members described and did not move to South Carolina during Reconstruction.  He died in Washington, DC in 1868.

The depictions of mass Klan paramilitary actions do not seem to have historical equivalents, although there were incidents in 1871 where Klan groups traveled from other areas in fairly large numbers to aid localities in disarming local companies of the all-black portion of the state militia under various justifications prior to the eventual Federal troop intervention and the organized Klan's continued activities as small groups of &quot;night riders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;West, Jerry Lee. ''The Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan in York County, South Carolina, 1865-1877'' (2002) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]] and other social movements created a new generation of historians, such as scholar [[Eric Foner]], who led a reassessment of Reconstruction. Building on Du Bois' work but also adding new sources, they focused on achievements of the African American and white Republican coalitions, such as establishment of universal public education and charitable institutions in the South and extension of [[suffrage]] to black men. In response, the Southern-dominated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and its affiliated white militias used extensive terrorism, intimidation and outright assassinations to suppress African-American leaders and voting in the 1870s and to regain power.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War''. New York: Farrar Strauss and Giroux, 2006, p. 150-154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Released in 1915, The Birth of a Nation has been credited as groundbreaking among its contemporaries for its innovative application of the medium of film.  The content of the work, however, has received widespread criticism for its blatantly racist and fantastical depictions of scenes that are presented onscreen as if in documentary form.  Film critic Roger Ebert writes, &quot;Certainly ''The Birth of a Nation'' (1915) presents a challenge for modern audiences. Unaccustomed to silent films and uninterested in film history, they find it quaint and not to their taste. Those evolved enough to understand what they are looking at find the early and wartime scenes brilliant, but cringe during the postwar and Reconstruction scenes, which are racist in the ham-handed way of an old minstrel show or a vile comic pamphlet.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Birth of a Nation (1915)|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030330/REVIEWS08/303300301/1023|work=rogerebert.com: great movies|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its day, it was the highest-grossing film, taking in more than $10 million, according to the box cover of the Shepard version of the DVD (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000000|1915}}}} today).&lt;ref name=CPIndex /&gt;

The website ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', which compiles reviews from various sources, indicates the film has a 100% &quot;fresh&quot; (positive) rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/birth_of_a_nation/ | title=The Birth of a Nation Movie Reviews | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc | accessdate=2008-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].  Despite its controversial story, the film has been praised by film critics such as [[Roger Ebert]], who said: &quot;''The Birth of a Nation'' is not a bad film because it argues for evil. Like Riefenstahl’s ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ebert/&gt;

According to a 2002 article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the film facilitated the refounding of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/316.html Hartford-HWP.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], A Painful Present as Historians Confront a Nation's Bloody Past.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the 1970s, the Ku Klux Klan continued to use the film as a recruitment tool.

==Sequel==
A sequel called ''[[The Fall of a Nation]]'' was released to theaters one year later, in 1916.  The film was directed by [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.|Thomas Dixon]], who adapted it from the novel of the same name.  The film has three acts and a prologue.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0006664|The Fall of a Nation (1916)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite its success in the foreign market, the film was not a success among the American audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Racist: The Life and Films of Thomas Dixon |first=Anthony |last=Slide |year=2004 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |pages=102 |isbn=0813123283 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ng_fyVJVMz4C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is considered a [[lost film]].

==New opening titles on re-release==
One famous part of the film was added by Griffith only on the second run of the film&lt;ref&gt;Richard Schickel, D. W. Griffith: An American Life (New York: Limelight Editions, 1984), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; and is missing from most online versions of the film (presumably taken from first run prints.)&lt;ref&gt;This includes the one at the Internet Movie Archive [http://www.archive.org/details/dw_griffith_birth_of_a_nation] and the Google video copy [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5639233838609252948#] and Veoh [http://www.veoh.com/browse/videos/category/entertainment/watch/v1640308YD8z9qcp]. However, of multiple YouTube copies one which has the full opening titles is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPxRIF1c2fI]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;These are the second and third of three opening title cards which defend the film. The added titles read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A PLEA FOR THE ART OF THE MOTION PICTURE:
We do not fear censorship, for we have no wish to offend with improprieties or obscenities, but we do demand, as a right, the liberty to show the dark side of wrong, that we may illuminate the bright side of virtue - the same liberty that is conceded to the art of the written word - that art to which we owe the Bible and the works of Shakespeare
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If in this work we have conveyed to the mind the ravages of war to the end that war may be held in abhorrence, this effort will not have been in vain.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Various film historians have expressed a range of views about these titles. To Nicholas Andrew Miller, this shows that &quot;Griffith's greatest achievement in ''The Birth of  Nation'' was that he brought the cinema's capacity for spectacle...under the rein of an outdated by comfortably literary form of historical narrative. Griffith's models...are not the pioneers of film spectacle...but the giants of literary narrative.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modernism, Ireland and the erotics of memory |last=Miller |first= Nicholas Andrew |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0521815835, 9780521815833 |page=114 |pages=226  |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, S.

[[Image:Baltic Sea (Darlowo).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Baltic Sea in [[Darłowo]].]]

The '''Baltic Sea''' is a [[brackish]] [[Mediterranean sea (oceanography)|mediterranean sea]] located in [[Northern Europe]], from [[53rd parallel north|53°N]] to [[66th parallel north|66°N]] [[latitude]] and from [[20th meridian east|20°E]] to [[26th meridian east|26°E]] [[longitude]]. It is bounded by the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], the mainland of [[Europe]], and the [[Denmark|Danish]] islands. It drains into the [[Kattegat]] by way of the [[Øresund]], the [[Great Belt]] and the [[Little Belt]]. The Kattegat continues through [[Skagerrak]] into the [[North Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The Baltic Sea is connected by man-made waterways to the [[White Sea]] via the [[White Sea Canal]], and to the North Sea via the [[Kiel Canal]]. The Baltic Sea might be considered to be bordered on its northern edge by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], on its northeastern edge by the [[Gulf of Finland]], and on its eastern edge by the [[Gulf of Riga]]. These various gulfs can also be considered part of the Baltic Sea.

== Geophysical data ==
[[Image:BalticSea March2000 NASA-S2000084115409 md.jpg|thumb|Baltic Sea in winter]]
The Baltic Sea is a [[brackish water|brackish]] inland sea, perhaps the largest body of brackish water in the world (other possibilities include the [[Black Sea]] and [[Hudson Bay]]). The Baltic Sea occupies a basin formed by glacial erosion during the last few [[Ice Age]]s.

===Dimensions===
The Baltic sea is about 1600&amp;nbsp;km (1000&amp;nbsp;mi) long, an average of 193&amp;nbsp;km (120&amp;nbsp;mi) wide, and an average of 55&amp;nbsp;m (180&amp;nbsp;ft, 30 [[fathom]]s) deep. The maximum depth is 459&amp;nbsp;m (1506&amp;nbsp;ft), on the Swedish side of the center. The surface area is about 377,000&amp;nbsp;km² (145,522 [[Square mile|sq&amp;nbsp;mi]]) and the volume is about 20,000&amp;nbsp;km³ (5040 [[cubic mile|cubic&amp;nbsp;mile]]s). The periphery amounts to about 8000&amp;nbsp;km (4968&amp;nbsp;mi) of coastline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060421230004/http://www.envir.ee/baltics/geograph.htm Geography of Baltic Sea Area&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
While [[Tacitus]] called it [[Mare Suebicum]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], [[Germania (book)]]: ''Ergo iam dextro Suebici maris litore Aestiorum gentes adluuntur, quibus ritus habitusque Sueborum, lingua Britannicae propior.''[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ger.shtml#45] - ''Upon the right of the Suevian Sea the AEstyan nations reside, who use the same customs and attire with the Suevians; their language more resembles that of Britain.''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2995/2995-h/2995-h.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; after the Germanic people of the [[Suebi]], the first to name it also as the ''Baltic Sea'' (''[[wikt:Mare Balticum|Mare Balticum]]'') was eleventh century German chronicler [[Adam of Bremen]]. The origin of the latter name is speculative. It might be connected to the Germanic word ''belt'', a name used for two of the Danish straits, [[the Belts]], while others claim it to be derived from [[Latin]] ''balteus'' (belt).&lt;ref name=&quot;Latin-etymology&quot;&gt;{{sv_icon}} [http://runeberg.org/nfbb/0435.html Balteus] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However it should be noted that the name of the Belts might be connected to Danish ''bælte'', which also means belt. Furthermore [[Adam of Bremen]] himself compared the Sea with a belt stating that the Sea is named so because it stretches through the land as a belt (''Balticus, eo quod in modum baltei longo tractu per Scithicas regiones tendatur usque in Greciam''). He might also have been influenced by name of legendary island mentioned in [[Natural History (Pliny)|The Natural History]] by [[Pliny the Elder]]. Pliny mentions an island named [[Baltia]] (or ''Balcia'') with reference to accounts of [[Pytheas]] and [[Xenophon]]. It is possible that Pliny refers to island named ''Basilia'' (&quot;kingdom&quot; or &quot;royal&quot;) in ''On the Ocean'' by Pytheas. ''Baltia'' also might be derived from &quot;belt&quot; and means &quot;near belt of sea (strait)&quot;. Meanwhile others have concluded that the name of the island originates from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root [http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&amp;basename=/data/ie/piet&amp;text_number=+129&amp;root=config *''bhel''] meaning ''white, fair''. Yet another explanation is that, while derived from the afore mentioned root, the name of the sea is related to naming for various forms of water and related substances in several European languages, that might have been originally associated colors found in swamps.&lt;!-- this sentence means that possible meanings range from white and pale to lake, swamp and puddle --&gt; Another explanation is that the name was related to swamp and originally meant &quot;enclosed sea, bay&quot; as opposed to open sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;baltu valodas&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Dini |first=Pierto Umberto |editor= |others=Translated from Italian by Dace Meiere |title= Baltu valodas |origyear=1997 |year=2000 |publisher=Jānis Roze |location=Riga |language=Latvian |isbn= 9984-623-96-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages the sea was known by variety of names, the name ''Baltic Sea'' started to dominate only after 16th century. Usage of ''Baltic'' and similar terms to denote the region east from the sea started only in 19th century.

===Name in other languages===
The Baltic Sea, in ancient sources known as [[Mare Suebicum]] (also known as [[Mare Germanicum]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Hartmann Schedel]] 1493 map [http://www.nada.kth.se/~ovidiu/maps/images/1493-schedel-europa.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; is also known by the equivalents of &quot;East Sea&quot;, &quot;West Sea&quot;, or &quot;Baltic Sea&quot; in different languages:
* In ''[[Germanic languages]]'', except English, '''''East Sea''''' is used: [[Afrikaans]] (''Oossee''), [[Danish language|Danish]] (''Østersøen''), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (''Oostzee''), [[German language|German]] (''Ostsee''), [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] (''Eystrasalt''), [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (''Østersjøen''), and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (''Östersjön''). In [[Old English]] it was known as ''Ostsæ''.
* In addition, [[Finnish language|Finnish]], a ''[[Baltic-Finnic languages|Baltic-Finnic language]]'', has [[calque]]d the Swedish term as ''Itämeri'' &quot;East Sea&quot;, disregarding the geography (the sea is west of Finland), though understandably since Finland was a part of Sweden from Middle Ages until 1809.
* In another Baltic-Finnic language, [[Estonian language|Estonian]], it is called the '''''West Sea''''' (''Läänemeri''), with the correct geography (the sea is west of Estonia).
* '''''Baltic Sea''''' is used in ''[[English language|English]]''; in the ''[[Baltic languages]]'' [[Latvian language|Latvian]] (''Baltijas jūra'') and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] (''Baltijos jūra''); in ''[[Latin]]'' (''Mare Balticum'') and the ''[[Romance languages]]'' [[French language|French]] (''Mer Baltique''), [[Italian language|Italian]] (''Mar Baltico''), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''Mar Báltico''), [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (''Marea Baltică'') and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''Mar Báltico''); in [[Greek language|Greek]] (''Βαλτική Θάλασσα''); in the ''[[Slavic languages]]'' [[Polish language|Polish]] (''Morze Bałtyckie'' or ''Bałtyk''), [[Czech language|Czech]] (''Baltské moře'' or ''Balt''), [[Croatian language|Croatian]] (''Baltičko more''), [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] (''Baltsko morje''), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] (''Baltijsko More'' (''Балтийско море''), [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] (''Bôłt''), [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] (''Балтичко Море / Baltičko More''), [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (''Балтійське море'' (&quot;Baltijs'ke More&quot;), [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] (''Балтыйскае мора'' (&quot;Baltyjskaje Mora&quot;), [[Russian (language)|Russian]] (''Балтийское море'' (&quot;Baltiyskoye Morye&quot;) and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (''Балтичко море'' / ''Baltičko more''); in the [[Hungarian language]] (''Balti-tenger''); and also in [[Basque language|Basque]] (''Itsaso Baltikoa'').

==Sea ice==
On the long-term average, the Baltic Sea is ice-covered for about 45% of its surface area at the maximum annually. The ice-covered area during such a typical winter includes the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], the [[Gulf of Finland]], [[Gulf of Riga]], Väinameri in the Estonian archipelago, the [[Stockholm archipelago]] and the [[Archipelago Sea]]. The remainder of the Baltic itself does not freeze during a normal winter, with the exception of sheltered bays and shallow lagoons such as the [[Curonian Lagoon]]. The ice reaches its maximum extent in February or March; typical ice thickness in the northernmost areas in the [[Bothnian Bay]], the northern basin of the Gulf of Bothnia, is about {{convert|70|cm|0|abbr=on}} for landfast sea ice. The thickness decreases farther south.

Freezing begins in the northern extremities of [[Gulf of Bothnia]] typically in middle of November, reaching the open waters of [[Bothnian Bay]] in early January. The [[Bothnian Sea]], the basin south [[Kvarken]], freezes on average in late February. The Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga freeze typically in late January. In 2011, the Gulf of Finland was completely frozen on 15 February.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helsingin Sanomat]], 16 February 2011, p. A8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ice extent depends on whether the winter is mild, moderate or severe. Severe winters can lead to ice formation around southern [[Sweden]] and even in the [[Danish straits]]. According to William Derham, during the severe winters of 1703 and 1708 the ice cover permeated as far as the Danish straits, parts of the Gulf of Bothnia and Gulf of Finland, in addition to coastal fringes in more southerly locations such as the Gulf of Riga. This description would actually have meant that the whole of the Baltic Sea had been covered with ice.

It is known that since 1720, the Baltic Sea has frozen over entirely only 20 times. The most recent case was in early 1987, which was the most severe winter in Scandinavia since that date. The ice then covered 400 000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. During the winter of 2010/11, which was quite severe compared to those of the last decades, the maximum ice cover was 310 000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which was reached on 24 February 2011. The ice then extended from the north down to the northern tip of [[Gotland]], with small ice free areas on its either side, and the east coast of the Baltic Sea was covered by an ice sheet ca. 25–100 km wide all the way down to [[Gdańsk]]. This was brought about by a stagnant [[high-pressure area]] that lingered over central and northern Scandinavia from ca. 10 February to 24 February. After this, strong southern winds pushed the ice further into the north, and much of the waters north of Gotland were again free of ice, which had then packed against the shores of southern Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helsingin Sanomat]], 10 February 2011, p. A4.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[Helsingin Sanomat]], 25 February 2011, p. A5.&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of the afore-mentioned high-pressure area did not reach the southern parts of the Baltic Sea, and thus the entire sea did not freeze over. However, floating ice was additionally observed near [[Świnoujście]] harbour during the January 2010.

In the recent years prior to 2011, [[Bothnian Bay]] and the [[Bothnian Sea]] were frozen with solid ice near the Baltic coast and dense floating ice far from it. In 2007 there was almost no ice formation except for a short period in March.&lt;ref&gt;Sea Ice survey, Space Science and Engineering Centre, University of Wisconsin, http://www.ssec.wisc.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jäämäed Puhtulaiul 1.JPG|thumb|Piles of drift ice on the shore of Puhtulaid, near [[Virtsu]], Estonia, in late April]]
During winter, [[fast ice]], which is attached to the [[shoreline]], develops first, rendering the ports unusable without the services of [[icebreaker]]s. [[Level ice]], [[ice sludge]], [[pancake ice]] or [[rafter ice]] form in the more open regions. The gleaming expanse of ice is similar to the [[Arctic]], with wind-driven pack ice and ridges up to 15&amp;nbsp;m. Offshore of the landfast ice, the ice remains very dynamic all year, and it is relatively easily moved around by winds and therefore forms [[pack ice]], made up of large piles and ridges pushed against the landfast ice and shores.

In spring, the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia normally thaw during in late April, with some ice ridges persisting until May in the eastern extremities of the Gulf of Finland. In the northernmost reaches of the Bothnian Bay, ice usually stays until late May; by early June it is practically always gone.

The ice cover is the main habitat only two larger animal species. They are the [[grey seal]] (''Halichoerus grypus'') and the [[Baltic ringed seal]] (''Pusa hispida botnica'') that both feed underneath and breed on the ice. Of these two seals, only the Baltic ringed seal suffers when there is not an adequate ice in the Baltic Sea, as it feeds its young only on ice. The grey seal is adapted to reproducing also with no ice in the sea. The sea ice also harbours several species of algae that live in the bottom and inside brine pockets in the ice.

==Hydrography==
The Baltic Sea flows out through the [[Danish straits]]; however, the flow is complex. A surface layer of brackish water discharges 940&amp;nbsp;km³ per year into the [[North Sea]]. Due to the difference in [[salinity]], a sub-surface layer of more saline water moving in the opposite direction brings in 475&amp;nbsp;km³ per year. It mixes very slowly with the upper waters, resulting in a salinity gradient from top to bottom, with most of the salt water remaining below 40 to 70&amp;nbsp;m deep. The general circulation is counter-clockwise: northwards along its eastern boundary, and south along the western one (Alhonen 88).

The difference between the outflow and the inflow comes entirely from fresh [[water]]. More than 250 streams drain a basin of about 1.6 million km², contributing a volume of 660&amp;nbsp;km³ per year to the Baltic. They include the major rivers of north Europe, such as the [[Oder]], the [[Vistula]], the [[Neman River|Neman]], the [[Daugava]] and the [[Neva]]. Additional fresh water comes from the difference of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] less evaporation, which is positive.

An important source of salty water are infrequent inflows of [[North Sea]] water into the Baltic. Such inflows, important to the Baltic ecosystem because of the oxygen they transport into the Baltic deeps, used to happen on average every four to five years until the 1980s. In recent decades they have become less frequent. The latest three occurred in 1983, 1993 and 2003 suggesting a new inter-inflow period of about ten years.

The water level is generally far more dependent on the regional wind situation than on tidal effects. However, tidal currents occur in narrow passages in the western parts of the Baltic Sea.

The [[significant wave height]] is generally much lower than that of the [[North Sea]]. Violent and sudden storms often sweep the surface, due to large transient temperature differences and a long reach of wind. Seasonal winds also cause small changes in sea level, of the order of 0.5&amp;nbsp;m (Alhonen 88).

==Salinity==
The Baltic Sea's [[salinity]] is much lower than that of ocean water (which averages 35[[parts per thousand|‰]]), as a result of abundant freshwater runoff from the surrounding land, combined with the shallowness of the sea itself; indeed, runoff contributes roughly one-fortieth its total volume per year, as the volume of the basin is about 21,000&amp;nbsp;km³ and yearly runoff is about 500&amp;nbsp;km³. The open surface waters of the central basin have salinity of 6 to 8&amp;nbsp;[[parts per thousand|‰]]. At the semi-enclosed bays with major freshwater inflows, such as head of Finnish Gulf with Neva mouth and head of Bothnian gulf with close mouths of Lule, Tornio and Kemi, the salinity is considerably lower. Below 40 to 70&amp;nbsp;m, the salinity is between 10 and 15&amp;nbsp;[[parts per thousand|‰]] in the open Baltic Sea, and more than this near Danish Straits.  

The flow of fresh water into the sea from approximately two-hundred rivers and the introduction of salt from the South builds up a gradient of salinity in the Baltic Sea. Near the [[Danish straits]] the salinity is close to that of the Kattegat, but still not fully oceanic, because the saltiest water that passes the straits is still already mixed with considerable amounts of outflow water. The salinity steadily decreases towards North and East. At the northern part of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] the water is no longer salty and many fresh water species live in the sea. The salinity gradient is paralleled by a temperature gradient. These two factors limit many species of animals and plants to a relatively narrow region of Baltic Sea.

The most saline water is vertically stratified in the water column to the [[North Sea|north]], creating a barrier to the exchange of [[oxygen]] and nutrients, and fostering completely separate maritime environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDF|[http://www.ices.dk/projects/balticsea/baltic%20sea-rse%20thulin%20and%20andrusaitis.pdf The Baltic Sea: Its Past, Present and Future]|352&amp;nbsp;KB}}, Jan Thulin and Andris Andrushaitis, Religion, Science and the Environment Symposium V on the Baltic Sea (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional emergence==
[[Image:Suomi jaakauden jalkeen.png|thumb|200px|Much of modern [[Finland]] is former seabed or archipelago: illustrated are sea levels immediately after the last ice age.]]
The land is still emerging [[isostasy|isostatically]] from its subsident state, which was caused by the weight of the last glaciation. The phenomenon is known as [[post-glacial rebound]]. Consequently, the surface area and the depth of the sea are diminishing. The uplift is about eight millimetres per year on the Finnish coast of the northernmost Gulf of Bothnia. In the area, the former seabed is only gently sloped, leading to large areas of land being reclaimed in, geologically speaking, relatively short periods (decades and centuries).

== Geographic data ==
===Extent===
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Baltic Sea as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bordered by the coasts of Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Germany extends north-eastward of the following limits:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Subdivisions===
The northern part of the Baltic Sea is known as the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], of which the northernmost part is the Bay of Bothnia &lt;!-- redirects to: --&gt; or [[Bothnian Bay]]. The more rounded southern basin of the gulf is called [[Bothnian Sea]] and immediately to the south of it lies the [[Sea of Åland]]. The [[Gulf of Finland]] connects the Baltic Sea with [[Saint Petersburg]]. The [[Gulf of Riga]] lies between the [[Latvia]]n capital city of [[Riga]] and the [[Estonia]]n island of [[Saaremaa]].

The [[Northern Baltic|Northern Baltic Sea]] lies between the [[Stockholm]] area, southwestern Finland and Estonia. The [[Gotland Basin|Western and Eastern Gotland Basins]] form the major parts of the Central Baltic Sea or Baltic proper. The [[Bornholm Basin]] is the area east of [[Bornholm]], and the shallower [[Arkona Basin]] extends from Bornholm to the Danish isles of [[Falster]] and [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]].

In the south, the [[Bay of Gdańsk]] lies east of the [[Hel peninsula]] on the Polish coast and west of [[Sambia]] in [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]. The [[Bay of Pomerania]] lies north of the islands of [[Usedom]] and [[Wolin]], east of [[Rügen]]. Between Falster and the German coast lie the [[Bay of Mecklenburg]] and [[Bay of Lübeck]]. The westernmost part of the Baltic Sea is the [[Bay of Kiel]]. The three [[Danish straits]], the [[Great Belt]], the [[Little Belt]] and [[Öresund|The Sound]] (''Ö/Øresund''), connect the Baltic Sea with the [[Kattegat]] bay and [[Skagerrak]] strait in the [[North Sea]].

===Land use===
[[Image:2 SPN 01.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Polish coast [[dunes]].]]
The Baltic sea drainage basin is roughly four times the surface area of the sea itself. About 48% of the region is forested, with Sweden and Finland containing the majority of the forest, especially around the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland.

About 20% of the land is used for agriculture and pasture, mainly in Poland and around the edge of the Baltic Proper, in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. About 17% of the basin is unused open land with another 8% of wetlands. Most of the latter are in the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland.

The rest of the land is heavily populated.

===Demographics===
About 85 million people live in the Baltic drainage basin, 15 million within {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} of the coast and 29 million within {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} of the coast. Around 22 million live in population centers of over 250,000. 90% of these are concentrated in the {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} band around the coast. Of the nations containing all or part of the basin, Poland includes 45% of the 85 million, Russia 12%, Sweden 10% and the others (see below) less than 6% each.

== Geologic history ==

[[Image:Baltic History 7500-BC.svg|thumb|[[Ancylus Lake]] around 8 700 years BP. The relic of Scandinavian Glacier in white. The river Svea älv (Svea river) formed an outlet to the [[Atlantic]].]]

The Baltic Sea somewhat resembles a [[river]]bed, with two tributaries, the [[Gulf of Finland]] and [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. [[Geology|Geological]] surveys show that before the [[Pleistocene]] instead of the Baltic Sea, there was a wide plain around a big river called the [[Eridanos (geology)|Eridanos]]. Several [[glaciation]] episodes during the [[Pleistocene]] scooped out the river bed into the sea basin. By the time of the last, or [[Eemian Stage]] ([[Marine isotopic stage|MIS]]&amp;nbsp;5e), the Eemian sea was in place. Instead of a true sea, the Baltic can even today also be understood as the common [[estuary]] of all rivers flowing into it.

From that time the waters underwent a geologic history summarized under the names listed below. Many of the stages are named after marine animals (e.g. the [[Littorina]] [[mollusk]]) that are clear markers of changing water temperatures and salinity.

The factors that determined the sea's characteristics were the submergence or emergence of the region due to the weight of ice and subsequent isostatic readjustment, and the connecting channels it found to the [[North Sea]]-[[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], either through the straits of [[Denmark]] or at what are now the large lakes of [[Sweden]], and the [[White Sea]]-[[Arctic Sea]].

== History ==
At the time of the [[Roman Empire]], the Baltic Sea was known as the ''Mare Suebicum'' or ''Mare Sarmaticum''. [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] in his AD&amp;nbsp;98 ''Agricola'' and ''Germania'' described the Mare Suebicum, named for the [[Suebi]] tribe, during the spring months, as a [[brackish water|brackish]] [[sea]] when the ice on the Baltic Sea broke apart and chunks floated about. The Suebi eventually migrated south west to reside for a while in the Rhineland area of modern Germany, where their name survives in the historic region known as [[Swabia]]. The [[Sarmatian]] tribes inhabited Eastern Europe and southern Russia. [[Jordanes]] called it the ''Germanic Sea'' in his work the [[Getica]].

Since the [[Viking age]], the Scandinavians have called it &quot;the Eastern Lake&quot; (''Austmarr'', &quot;Eastern Sea&quot;, appears in the [[Heimskringla]] and ''Eystra salt'' appears in [[Sörla þáttr]]), but [[Saxo Grammaticus]] recorded in [[Gesta Danorum]] an older name ''[[Gandvik]]'', ''&quot;-vik&quot;'' being [[Old Norse]] for &quot;bay&quot;, which implies that the Vikings correctly regarded it as an inlet of the sea. (Another form of the name, &quot;Grandvik&quot;, attested in at least one English translation of Gesta Danorum, is likely to be a misspelling.)
[[File:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|Main trading routes of the Hanseatic League.]]
In addition to [[fish]] the sea also provides [[amber]], especially from its southern shores. The bordering countries have traditionally provided [[lumber]], [[tar|wood tar]], [[flax]], [[hemp]], and [[fur]]s. Sweden had from early medieval times also a flourishing [[mining]] industry, especially on [[iron]] ore and [[silver]]. [[Poland]] had and still has extensive [[salt]] mines. All this has provided for rich trading since the Roman times.

In the [[early Middle Ages]], [[Vikings]] of Scandinavia built their trade empire all around the Baltic. Later, there were fights for control over the sea with [[Wends|Wendish tribes]] dwelling on the southern shore. The Vikings also used the rivers of Russia for trade routes, finding their way eventually to the [[Black Sea]] and southern Russia. This Viking-dominated period is also referred to as [[Viking Age]].

Lands next to the sea's eastern shore were among the last in Europe to be converted into [[Christianity]] in the [[Northern Crusades]]: [[Finland]] in the twelfth century by the Swedes, and what are now [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] in the early thirteenth century by the Danes and the Germans ([[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]]). The [[Teutonic Knights]] gained control over parts of the southern and eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, where they set up [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|their monastic state]] while fighting the [[Poles]], the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], the [[Sweden|Swedes]], the [[Russians]] of ancient [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]], and the [[Lithuanians]] (the [[Christianization of Lithuania|last Europeans to convert to Christianity]]).

In the 12th century, there was intensification of [[Baltic Slavic piracy]]. Starting in the 11th century, the southern and eastern shores of the Baltic were settled by [[Germans]] (and to a lesser extent by [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]], [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] and [[Scottish people|Scots]]) in the course of the [[Ostsiedlung]]. The [[Polabian Slavs]] were gradually assimilated by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/639735/Wend Wend -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denmark]] gradually gained control over most of the Baltic coast, until she lost much of her possessions after being defeated in the 1227 [[Battle of Bornhöved (1227)|Battle of Bornhöved]].
[[File:Eerste fase van de Zeeslag in de Sont - First phase of the Battle of the Sound - November 8 1568 (Jan Abrahamsz Beerstraten, 1660).jpg|thumb|right|The naval [[Battle of the Sound]] took place on 8 November 1658 during the [[Dutch-Swedish War]].]]
In the 13th to 17th centuries, the strongest economic force in Northern Europe became the [[Hanseatic league]], which used the Baltic Sea to establish trade routes between its member cities. In the seventeenth century the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] became the dominant traders. In the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] fought wars for ''Dominium Maris Baltici'' (&quot;Ruling over the Baltic Sea&quot;). Eventually, it was the [[Swedish Empire]] that virtually encompassed the Baltic Sea. In Sweden the sea was then referred to as ''Mare Nostrum Balticum'' (&quot;Our Baltic Sea&quot;).

In the eighteenth century, [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and [[Prussia]] became the leading powers over the sea. The [[Great Northern War]], ending with [[Sweden]]'s defeat, brought Russia to the eastern coast. Since then, Russia was a dominating power in the Baltic. Russia's [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] saw the strategic importance of the Baltic and decided to found his new capital, [[Saint Petersburg]] at the mouth of the [[Neva]] river at the east end of the [[Gulf of Finland]]. There was much trading not just within the Baltic region but also with the North Sea region, especially eastern [[England]] and the [[Netherlands]]: their fleets needed the Baltic timber, tar, flax and hemp.

During the [[Crimean War]], a joint [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] fleet attacked the Russian fortresses by bombarding [[Sveaborg]], which guards [[Helsinki]]; [[Kronstadt, Russia|Kronstadt]], which guards Saint Petersburg; and by destroying [[Bomarsund, Åland|Bomarsund]] in the [[Åland Islands]]. After the unification of [[Germany]] in 1871, the whole southern coast became German. The [[World War I|First World War]] was partly fought in the Baltic Sea. After 1920 [[Poland]] was connected to the Baltic Sea by the [[Polish Corridor]] and enlarged the port of [[Gdynia]] in rivalry with the port of the [[Free City of Danzig]].
[[Image:Cap Arcona burning.jpg|thumb|The burning ''[[Cap Arcona]]'' shortly after the attacks, 3rd May 1945. Only 350 of the 4,500 prisoners who had been aboard the ''Cap Arcona'' survived.]]
During [[World War II|the Second World War]], Germany reclaimed all of the southern shore and much of the eastern by occupying Poland and the [[Baltic states]]. In 1945, the Baltic Sea became a mass grave for retreating soldiers and refugees on torpedoed [[Operation Hannibal|troop transports]]. The sinking of the [[Wilhelm Gustloff (ship)|''Wilhelm Gustloff'']] remains the worst maritime disaster, killing (very roughly) 9,000 people. In 2005, a Russian group of scientists found over five thousand airplane wrecks, sunken warships, and other [[material]] mainly from [[world War II|the Second World War]], lying at the bottom of the sea.

Since the end of World War II, various nations, including the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, have disposed of chemical weapons in the Baltic Sea, raising concerns of environmental contamination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3102728,00.html Chemical Weapon Time Bomb Ticks in the Baltic Sea] ''Deutsche Welle'', 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Even now fishermen accidentally retrieve some of these materials: the most recent available report from the Helsinki Commission notes that four small scale catches of [[Chemical warfare|CW]] munitions representing approximately 105 kilograms (231&amp;nbsp;lbs) of material were reported in 2005. This is a reduction from the 25 incidents representing 1,110 kilograms (2,447&amp;nbsp;lbs) of material in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helcom.fi/stc/files/Publications/Proceedings/bsep112.pdf Activities 2006: Overview] Baltic Sea Environment Proceedings No. 112. [[Helsinki Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; Until now, the U.S. government refuses to disclose the exact coordinates of the wreck sites. Rotting bottles leak [[Mustard gas|Lost]] and other substances, thus slowly poisoning a substantial part of the Baltic Sea. 

After 1945, the [[German exodus from Eastern Europe|German population was expelled]] from all areas east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], making room for Polish and Russian settlers. [[Poland]] gained a vast [[Former eastern territories of Germany|stretch of the southern shore]], Russia gained another access to the Baltic with the [[Kaliningrad oblast]]. The [[Baltic states]] on the eastern shore were occupied by the [[Soviet Union]], Poland and [[GDR|East Germany]] became [[communist]] states. The sea then was a border between opposing military blocs: in the case of military conflict, in parallel with a Soviet offensive towards the [[Atlantic Ocean]], communist Poland's fleet was prepared to invade the Danish isles. This border status also impacted trade and travel, and came to an end only after the collapse of the communist regimes in Eastern and Central Europe in the late 1980s.

Since May 2004, on the accession of the [[Baltic states]] and [[Poland]], the Baltic Sea has been almost entirely surrounded by countries of the [[European Union]] (EU). The only remaining non-EU areas are the Russian [[metropolitan area|metropolis]] of Saint Petersburg and the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] [[exclave]].

Winter storms begin arriving in the region during October. These have caused numerous shipwrecks, and contributed to the extreme difficulties of rescuing passengers of the ferry ''[[M/S Estonia]]'' en route from [[Tallinn]], Estonia, to [[Stockholm]], Sweden, in September 1994, which claimed the lives of 852 people. Older, wood-based shipwrecks such as the ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]'' tend to remain well-preserved, as the Baltic's cold and brackish water does not suit the [[shipworm]].

== Biology ==
[[Image:Phytoplankton bloom in the Baltic Sea (July 3, 2001).jpg|thumb|[[Phytoplankton]] bloom in the Baltic Proper, July 3, 2001.]]
Approximately {{convert|100000|km²|0|abbr=on}} of the Baltic's seafloor (a quarter of its total area) is a variable [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]]. The more saline (and therefore denser) water remains on the bottom, isolating it from surface waters and the atmosphere. This leads to decreased oxygen concentrations within the zone. It is mainly bacteria that grow in it, digesting organic material and releasing hydrogen sulfide. Because of this large anaerobic zone, the seafloor ecology differs from that of the neighbouring Atlantic.

Plans to artificially oxygenate areas of the Baltic that have experienced eutrophication have been propsoed by the [[University of Gothenburg]] and Inocean AB. The proposal intends to use wind-driven pumps to inject oxygen (air) into waters at, or around, 130m below sea level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxygenation at a Depth of 120 Meters Could Save the Baltic Sea, Researchers Demonstrate|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110418141617.htm|publisher=Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The low salinity of the Baltic sea has led to the evolution of many slightly divergent species, such as the Baltic Sea [[herring]], which is a smaller variant of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] herring. The [[benthos|benthic fauna]] consists mainly of ''[[Monoporeia affinis]]'', which is originally a freshwater species. The lack of [[tides]] has affected the marine species as compared with the Atlantic.

The most common fish species that can be found in the Baltic Sea are [[codfish]], herring, [[hake]], [[plaice]], [[flounder]], sea trout, eel and [[turbot]].

Satellite images taken in July 2010 revealed a massive [[algal bloom]] covering {{convert|377000|sqkm|mi2|lk=in}} in the Baltic Sea. The area of the bloom extends from Germany and Poland to Finland. Researchers of the phenomenon have indicated that algal blooms have occurred every summer for decades. Fertilizer runoff from surrounding agricultural land has exacerbated the problem and led to increased [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Satellite spies vast algal bloom in Baltic Sea|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10740097|accessdate=27 July 2010|newspaper=BBC News|date=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the [[Great Belt Bridge]] in Denmark (completed 1997) and the [[Øresund Bridge]]-Tunnel (completed 1999), linking Denmark with Sweden, provided a highway and railroad connection between Sweden and the Danish mainland (the [[Jutland Peninsula]]). The undersea tunnel of the Oresund Bridge-Tunnel provides for navigation of large ships into and out of the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea is the main trade route for export of Russian petroleum. Many of the countries neighboring the Baltic Sea have been concerned about this, since a major oil leak in a seagoing tanker would be disastrous for the Baltic—given the slow exchange of water. The tourism industry surrounding the Baltic Sea is naturally concerned about oil pollution.

Much shipbuilding is carried out in the shipyards around the Baltic Sea. The largest shipyards are at [[Gdańsk]], [[Gdynia]], and [[Szczecin]], Poland; [[Kiel]], Germany; [[Karlskrona]], Sweden; [[Malmö]], Sweden; [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]], [[Turku]], and [[Helsinki]], Finland; [[Riga]], [[Ventspils]], and [[Liepāja]] (Latvia); [[Klaipėda]] (Lithuania); and [[St. Petersburg, Russia]].

There are several cargo and passenger ferries that operate on the Baltic Sea, such as [[Scandlines]], [[Silja Line]], [[Polferries]], the [[Viking Line]], [[Tallink]], and [[Superfast Ferries]].

==Tourism around the sea==
===European Route of Brick Gothic===
[[European Route of Brick Gothic]] is a touristic route connecting cities with Brick Gothic architecture in seven countries along the Baltic Sea: [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]].

===Piers===
* [[Liepaja]], [[Latvia]]
* [[Sopot]], [[Poland]]
* [[Międzyzdroje]], [[Poland]]
* [[Kołobrzeg]], [[Poland]]
* [[Klaipeda]], [[Lithuania]]

===Resort towns===

== The Helsinki Convention ==
===1974 Convention===
For the first time ever, all the sources of pollution around an entire sea were made subject to a single convention, signed in 1974 by the then seven Baltic coastal states. The 1974 Convention entered into force on 3 May 1980.

===1992 Convention===
In the light of political changes and developments in international environmental and maritime law, a new convention was signed in 1992 by all the states bordering on the Baltic Sea, and the European Community. After ratification the Convention entered into force on 17 January 2000. The Convention covers the whole of the Baltic Sea area, including inland waters and the water of the sea itself, as well as the seabed. Measures are also taken in the whole catchment area of the Baltic Sea to reduce land-based pollution. The Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area, 1992, entered into force on 17 January 2000.

The governing body of the Convention is the Helsinki Commission,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helcom.fi/home/en_GB/welcome/ Helcom : Welcome&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as HELCOM, or Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission. The present contracting parties are Denmark, Estonia, the European Community, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Sweden.

The ratification instruments were deposited by the European Community, Germany, Latvia and Sweden in 1994, by Estonia and Finland in 1995, by Denmark in 1996, by Lithuania in 1997 and by Poland and Russia in November 1999.

'''Brackish water''' is water that has more [[salinity]]  than fresh water, but not as much as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in [[estuary|estuaries]], or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root &quot;brak,&quot; meaning &quot;salty&quot;. Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular certain civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the salinity gradient power process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on [[shrimp farms]]).

Technically, brackish water contains between 0.5 and 30&amp;nbsp;grams of [[salt]] per [[litre]]&amp;mdash;more often expressed as 0.5 to 30 parts per thousand (ppt or ‰). Thus, ''brackish'' covers a range of [[Salinity#Systems of classification of water bodies based upon salinity|salinity regimes]] and is not considered a precisely defined condition. It is characteristic of many brackish surface waters that their salinity can vary considerably over space and/or time.

==Brackish water habitats==
===Estuaries===

[[Image:Monodactylus argenteus.JPG|thumb|A brackish water fish: ''Monodactylus argenteus'']]

Brackish water condition commonly occurs when fresh water meets sea water. In fact, the most extensive brackish water habitats worldwide are [[estuary|estuaries]], where a river meets the sea.

The [[River Thames]] flowing through [[London]] is a classic river estuary. The town of [[Teddington]] a few miles west of London marks the boundary between the tidal and non-tidal parts of the Thames, although it is still considered a freshwater river about as far east as [[Battersea]] insofar as the average salinity is very low and the fish fauna consists predominantly of freshwater species such as [[Rutilus|roach]], [[dace]], [[carp]], [[perch]], and [[pike (fish)|pike]]. The [[Thames Estuary]] becomes brackish between Battersea and [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], and the diversity of freshwater fish species present is smaller, primarily roach and dace, [[euryhaline]] marine species such as [[flounder]], [[European seabass]], [[mullet (fish)|mullet]], and [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]] become much more common. Further east, the salinity increases and the freshwater fish species are completely replaced by euryhaline marine ones, until the river reaches Gravesend, at which point conditions become fully marine and the fish fauna resembles that of the adjacent [[North Sea]] and includes both euryhaline and [[stenohaline]] marine species. A similar pattern of replacement can be observed with the aquatic plants and invertebrates living in the river.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/thames.htm The River Thames - its geology, geography and vital statistics from source to sea], The-River-Thames.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/wildlife.htm The River Thames - its natural history] The-River-Thames.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of [[ecological succession]] from a freshwater to marine [[ecosystem]] is typical of river estuaries. River estuaries form important staging points during the migration of [[Fish migration|anadromous and catadromus]] fish species, such as [[salmon]] and [[eel]]s, giving them time to form social groups and to adjust to the changes in salinity. Salmon are anadromous, meaning they live in the sea but ascend rivers to spawn; eels are catadromous, living in rivers and streams, but returning to the sea to breed. Besides the species that migrate through estuaries, there are many other fish that use them as &quot;nursery grounds&quot; for spawning or as places young fish can feed and grow before moving elsewhere. [[Herring]] and [[plaice]] are two commercially important species that use the Thames Estuary for this purpose.

Estuaries are also commonly used as fishing grounds, and as places for fish farming or ranching [http://www.eattilapia.com/tilapia-farming.php]. For example, [[Atlantic salmon]] farms are often located in estuaries, although this has caused controversy, because in doing so, fish farmers expose migrating wild fish to large numbers of external [[parasitism|parasites]] such as [[sea lice]] that escape from the pens the farmed fish are kept in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saveourseatrout.com/ Save our Seatrout]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mangroves===
Another important brackish water habitat is the [[mangrove swamp]] or '''mangal'''. Many, though not all, mangrove swamps fringe estuaries and lagoons where the salinity changes with each tide. Among the most specialised residents of mangrove forests are [[mudskippers]], fish that forage for food on land, and [[archer fish]], perch-like fish that &quot;spit&quot; at insects and other small animals living in the trees, knocking them into the water where they can be eaten. Like estuaries, mangrove swamps are extremely important breeding grounds for many fish, with species such as [[Lutjanidae|snapper]]s, [[halfbeak]]s, and [[tarpon]] spawning or maturing among them. Besides fish, numerous other animals use mangroves, including such specialists as the  [[saltwater crocodile]], [[American crocodile]], [[proboscis monkey]], [[diamondback terrapin]], and the [[Crab-eating Frog|crab-eating frog]], ''Fejervarya cancrivora'' (formerly ''Rana cancrivora'').

Although often plagued with [[mosquitoes]] and other insects that make them unpleasant for humans, mangrove swamps are very important buffer zones between land and sea, and are a natural defense against hurricane and tsunami damage in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=1823&amp;language=1 Mangrove forests 'can reduce impact of tsunamis'], Science and Development Network, December 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sundarbans]] and [[Pichavaram]] are two of the large mangrove forests in the world, both on the coast of the [[Bay of Bengal]].

===Brackish seas and lakes===
Some seas and lakes are brackish. The [[Baltic Sea]] is a brackish sea adjoining the [[North Sea]]. Originally the [[confluence]] of two major river systems prior to the [[Pleistocene]], since that it has been flooded by the North Sea but still receives so much freshwater from the adjacent lands that the water is brackish. Because the salt water coming in from the sea is denser than freshwater, the water in the Baltic is stratified, with salt water at the bottom and freshwater at the top. Limited mixing occurs because of the lack of tides and storms, with the result that the fish fauna at the surface is freshwater in composition while that lower down is more marine. [[Cod]] are an example of a species only found in deep water in the Baltic, while pike are confined to the less saline surface waters.

The [[Caspian Sea]] is the world's largest lake and contains brackish water with a salinity about one-third that of normal seawater. The Caspian is famous for its peculiar animal fauna, including one of the few non-marine seals (the [[Caspian seal]]) and the great [[sturgeon]]s, a major source of [[caviar]].

In the [[Black Sea]] the surface water is brackish with an average salinity of about 17-18 parts per thousand compared to 30 to 40 for the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Lüning, K., Yarish, C. &amp; Kirkman, H. ''Seaweeds: their environment, biogeography, and ecophysiology.'' Wiley-IEEE, 1990. p. 121. ISBN 978-0-471-62434-9&lt;/ref&gt; The deep, [[anoxic event|anoxic]] water of the Black Sea originates from warm, salty water of the [[Mediterranean]].

===Brackish marsh===
{{Main|Brackish marsh}}
A [[brackish marsh]] may occur where a freshwater flow enters a salt marsh.

'''The Bronx''' is the northernmost of the five [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]] of [[New York City]]. It is also known as '''Bronx County''', the last of the 62 [[Administrative divisions of New York#County|counties]] of [[New York|New York State]] to be incorporated. Located north of [[Manhattan]] and [[Queens]], and south of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], the Bronx is the only borough located primarily on the [[mainland]]. In March 2011, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] estimated that the borough's population in the April 1, [[2010 United States Census]] was 1,400,761,&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 Census pop est&quot; /&gt; inhabiting a land area of {{convert|42|sqmi|km2|0}}. This makes the Bronx the fourth-most-populated of the five boroughs, the fourth-largest in land area, and the third-highest in [[population density|density of population]].&lt;ref name=&quot;density&quot;&gt;[[U.S. Census Bureau]], [http://www.census.gov/statab/ccdb/ccdbstcounty.html ''County and City Data Book:2007''] Table B-1, Area and Population, retrieved on July 12, 2008.

The Bronx is divided by the [[Bronx River]] into a hillier section in the west, closer to Manhattan, and the flatter [[East Bronx]], closer to [[Long Island]]. The [[West Bronx]] was annexed to New York City (then largely confined to Manhattan) in 1874, and the areas east of the Bronx River in 1895.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultan&quot;/&gt; The Bronx first assumed a distinct legal identity when it became a borough of [[City of Greater New York|Greater New York]] in 1898. Bronx County, with the same boundaries as the borough, was separated from New York County (afterwards coextensive with the Borough of Manhattan) as of January 1, 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;courtstart&quot;&gt;On the start of business for Bronx County: [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=2&amp;res=9C05E7DA1F3BE633A25750C0A9679C946596D6CF Bronx County In Motion. New Officials All Find Work to Do on Their First Day.] ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 3, 1914 ([[PDF]] retrieved on June 26, 2008):
:&quot;Despite the fact that the new Bronx County Court House is not completed there was no delay yesterday in getting the court machinery in motion. All the new county officials were on hand and the County Clerk, the District Attorney, the Surrogate, and the County Judge soon had things in working order. The seal to be used by the new county was selected by County Judge Louis D. Gibbs. It is circular. In the centre is a seated figure of Justice. To her right is an American shield and over the figure is written 'Populi Suprema.' ...&quot;
:&quot;Surrogate George M. S. Schulz, with his office force, was busy at the stroke of 9 o'clock. Two wills were filed in the early morning, but owing to the absence of a safe they were recorded and then returned to the attorneys for safe keeping. ...&quot;
:&quot;There was a rush of business to the new County Clerk's office. Between seventy-five and a hundred men applied for first naturalization papers. Two certificates of incorporation were issued, and seventeen judgments, seven lis pendens, three mechanics' liens and one suit for negligence were filed.&quot;
:&quot;Sheriff O'Brien announced several additional appointments.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Bronx is the third-most-densely-populated county in the U.S.,&lt;ref name=&quot;density&quot;/&gt; about a quarter of its area is open space,&lt;ref name=&quot;blooming&quot;/&gt; including [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]], [[Van Cortlandt Park]], [[Pelham Bay Park]], the [[New York Botanical Garden]] and the [[Bronx Zoo]] in the borough's north and center, on land deliberately reserved in the late 19th century as urban development progressed northwards and eastwards from Manhattan with the building of roads, bridges and railways.

The [[Bronx River]] was named for [[Jonas Bronck]], an early settler from [[Småland]] in [[Sweden]] whose land bordered the river on the east. The borough of the Bronx was named for the river that was &quot;Bronck's River&quot;. The indigenous [[Lenape]] (Delaware) [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] were progressively displaced after 1643 by settlers from the Netherlands and Great Britain. The Bronx received many [[Irish-American|Irish]], [[German-American|German]], [[Jewish American|Jewish]] and [[Italian-American|Italian]] immigrants as its once-rural population exploded between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries. They were succeeded after 1945 by [[African Americans]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]] from the [[Caribbean]] basin — especially Puerto Rico&lt;ref&gt;Braver (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dominican Republic, but also from Jamaica. In recent years, this cultural mix has made the Bronx a wellspring of both [[Latin music]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].

The Bronx contains one of the five poorest Congressional Districts in the U.S., ([[New York's 16th congressional district|the 16th]]), but its wide variety of neighborhoods also includes the affluent [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] and [[Country Club, Bronx|Country Club]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barone&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stat Abst&quot;/&gt; The Bronx, particularly the [[South Bronx]], saw a sharp decline in population, livable housing, and the quality of life in the late 1960s and the 1970s, culminating in a wave of [[arson]], but has shown some signs of revival in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;See the &quot;Historical Populations&quot; table in [[#Before 1914|History]] above and its sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Bronx}}
For generations a rural area of small farms supplying the city markets, the Bronx grew into a railroad suburb in the late 19th century. Faster transportation allowed for rapid population growth in the late 19th century, involving the move from horse-drawn street cars to elevated railways to the subway system, which linked to Manhattan in 1904. The great majority lived in rented apartments. The demographic history of the Bronx in the 20th century may be divided into four periods: a boom during 1900–29, with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930. The  [[Great Depression]] and war years saw a slowing of growth. The 1950s were hard times, as the Bronx decayed 1950–79 from a predominantly middle-class to a predominantly lower-class area with high rates of crime and poverty. Finally the Bronx has enjoyed economic and demographic stabilization since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Olmsted (1989); Olmsted (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Bronx was for many years a manufacturing center, and in the early part of the 20th Century was noted as a center of piano manufacturing. In 1919, the Bronx was the site of 63 piano factories employing more than 5,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F20712FE3B5910738DDDA00A94D0405B898DF1D3|title=Piano Workers May Strike|date=Aug. 29, 1919|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of World War I, the Bronx hosted the rather small [[Bronx International Exposition of Science, Arts and Industries|1918 World's Fair]] at 177th Street and DeVoe Avenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultan&quot;&gt;Lloyd Ultan, Bronx Borough Historian, [http://www.bronxriver.org/?pg=content&amp;p=abouttheriver&amp;m1=9&amp;m2=58 &quot;History of the Bronx River,&quot;] Paper presented to the [[Bronx River Alliance]], November 5, 2002 (notes taken by Maarten de Kadt, November 16, 2002), retrieved on August 29, 2008. This 2½ hour talk covers much of the early history of the Bronx as a whole, in addition to the [[Bronx River]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Gray, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DE103DF931A15750C0A964958260 &quot;Streetscapes: The New York Coliseum; From Auditorium To Bus Garage to...&quot;] ''[[The New York Times]]'', Real Estate section, March 22, 1992, retrieved on July 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bronx underwent rapid growth after World War I. Extensions of the [[New York City Subway]] contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants flooded The Bronx, resulting in a major boom in residential construction. Among these groups, many [[Irish Americans]], [[Italian Americans]] and especially [[Jewish Americans]] settled here. In addition, [[French American|French]], [[German American|German]], and [[Polish American|Polish]] immigrants moved into the borough. The [[Judaism|Jewish]] population also increased notably during this time. In 1937, according to Jewish organizations, 592,185 Jews lived in The
Bronx (43.9% of the borough's population),&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World Almanac and Book of Facts]], 1943'', page 494, citing the [[American Jewish Committee]] and the Jewish Statistical Bureau of the [[Synagogue Council of America]]&lt;/ref&gt; while only 45,000 Jews lived in the borough in 2002. Many [[synagogue]]s still stand in the Bronx, but most have been converted to other uses.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Remembrance&quot;&gt;[http://www.bronxsynagogues.org/ic/bronxsyn/survey.html Remembrance of Synagogues Past: The Lost Civilization of the Jewish South Bronx], by Seymour J. Perlin, Ed.D. (retrieved on August 10, 2008), citing population estimates in &quot;The Jewish Community Study of New York: 2002&quot;, UJA [United Jewish Appeal] Federation of New York,
June 2004, and his own survey of synagogue sites.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] days (1920–33), [[rum-running|bootleggers]] and gangs were active in the Bronx. [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[Polish American|Polish]] gangs smuggled in most of the illegal whiskey.

After the 1930s, Irish Americans started moving further north, and German Americans followed suit in the 1940s, as did many Italian Americans in the 1950s and [[Jewish American|Jews]] in the 1960s. As the older generation retired, many moved to [[Florida]]. The migration has left an [[African American]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] (mostly [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]] and [[Dominican American|Dominican]])  population, along with some [[Caucasian American|Caucasian]] communities in the far southeastern and northwestern parts of the county.

In the 1970s, the South Bronx became iconic of America's urban crisis of unemployment and poverty, as arson in the city's public housing was a persistent symbol of the problem. However, led by aggressive community leaders, many burned-out tenements were replaced by single- and multifamily housing during the late 1970s to the present. Thus, [[Co-op City]] began in 1968 as a subsidized, high-rise, middle-class housing project, whose tenants bought shares in the corporation that operated it. It succeeded because it delivered on its promise of economic affordability and controlled racial integration.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000, the Bronx had a population of about 1.2 million, and its bridges, highways, and railroads were more heavily traveled than those of any other part of the United States.

===Fighting decline===

Starting in the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, the Bronx went into an era of sharp decline in the residents' [[quality of life]]. Historians and social scientists have put forward many factors. They include the theory (elaborated in [[Robert Caro]]'s biography ''[[The Power Broker]]'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred A. Knopf]], New York, 1974; ISBN 0-394-72024-5&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Robert Moses]]' [[Cross-Bronx Expressway]] destroyed existing residential neighborhoods. Another factor in the Bronx's decline may have been the development of [[high-rise]] [[Public housing in the United States and Canada|housing projects]].  Yet another may have been a reduction in the real-estate listings and property-related financial services (such as [[mortgages]] or insurance policies) offered in some areas of the Bronx — a process known as [[redlining]]. Others have suggested a &quot;[[planned shrinkage]]&quot; of municipal services, such as fire-fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Wallace: &quot;A synergism of plagues: 'planned shrinkage,' contagious housing destruction, and AIDS in the Bronx.&quot; ''Environmental Research'', October 1988, Vol. 47, No. 1, pp. 1–33, and &quot;Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx&quot;, ''Social Science &amp; Medicine'', Vol. 37, No. 7 (1990) pp. 801–813 — abstracts retrieved on July 5, 2008 from [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov PubMed]. One sentence in the abstract of the 1990 article reads, &quot;Empirical and theoretical analyses strongly imply present sharply rising levels of violent death, intensification of deviant behaviors implicated in the spread of AIDS, and the pattern of the AIDS outbreak itself, have been gravely affected, and even strongly determined, by the outcomes of a program of 'planned shrinkage' directed against African-American and Hispanic communities, and implemented through systematic and continuing denial of municipal services—particularly fire extinguishment resources—essential for maintaining urban levels of population density and ensuring community stability.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Issues such as redlining, hospital quality and what looked like the planned shrinkage of garbage collection became the contentious issues that sparked the [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] activists known as the [[Young Lords]]. The Young Lords coalesced with similar groups fighting for neighborhood empowerment, such as the [[Black Panthers]], to protest urban renewal and arson for profit with sit-ins and marches. See pages 6–9 of the guide to [http://www.pbs.org/pov/utils/youthviews/pov_palante_toolkit.pdf ''¡Palante Siempre Palante!'' The Young Lords] a &quot;P.O.V.&quot; (Point of View) documentary on the [[Public Broadcasting Service]].&lt;/ref&gt; There was also much debate as to whether [[rent control]] laws had made it less profitable (or more costly) for landlords to maintain existing buildings with their existing tenants than to abandon or destroy those buildings.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of this argument, as well as of several other theses mentioned here, see [http://www.city-data.com/forum/new-york-city/257896-when-bronx-burning-6.html &quot;When the Bronx was burning&quot;] ''City-data'' forum (blog), 2007, where rubygreta writes:&quot;Rent control destroyed the Bronx, especially starting in the 1960s and 1970s, when oil prices rose through the roof, and heavily subsidized Coop City opened in the East Bronx.
Essentially, tenants never moved out of their apartments because they had below-market rents thanks to rent control. The apartments deteriorated and common areas deteriorated because the landlords had no cash-flow. And no cash flow meant that they could not get mortgages for major repairs such as boilers, roofs and window replacement.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the Bronx was plagued by a wave of arson. The burning of buildings was mostly in the [[South Bronx]] and in [[West Farms, Bronx|West Farms]]. The most common explanation of what occurred was that landlords decided to burn their low property-value buildings and take the insurance money as profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945795-2,00.html |title= Arson for Hate and Profit |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= 1977-10-31 |accessdate= 2008-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fiery destruction of many buildings in the borough, the arsons slowed by the turn of the decade, but the after-effects were still felt into the 1990s.

Since the mid-1980s, some residential development has occurred in the Bronx, stimulated by the city's &quot;Ten-Year Housing Plan&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D6103AF934A35752C0A966958260  PERSPECTIVES: The 10-Year Housing Plan; Issues for the 90's: Management and Costs], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 7, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fanniemaefoundation.org/programs/hpd/pdf/hpd_1004_ryzin.pdf Neighborhood Change and the City of New York’s Ten-Year Housing Plan]'' ''Housing Policy Debate'' • Volume 10, Issue 4.

Among the remarks of Richard H. Neiman, New York State's Superintendent of Banks, were these: &quot;The Bronx was an economically stable community until the mid 60s when the entire South Bronx struggled with major construction, real estate issues, red-lining, and block busting. This included a thoroughfare that divided communities, the deterioration of property as a result of rent control, and decrease in the value of real estate.

By the mid 70s, the South Bronx was considered one of the most blighted urban cities in the country, with a loss of 60% of the population and 40% of housing units. The entire area struggled during the 80s and 90s to recover from this damage.

However, thanks to strong community leadership and the involvement of many of you, today, the Bronx is undergoing a resurgence, with new housing developments and thriving business.  From 2000 to 2006, there was a 2.2% increase in population and home ownership rates increased by 19.6%. ... When I look at maps of the Bronx, it's not difficult to see the areas that don't have bank branches. These areas, which are prime locations for new bank branches, include Community districts 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hispanicmpr.com/2007/12/11/new-bank-targets-latinos-in-south-bronx/ New bank targets Latinos in South Bronx] December 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On June 30, 2005, there were 129 Federally-insured banking offices in the Bronx, for a ratio of 1.0 offices for every 10,000 inhabitants.

Although not actually a city, in 1997, the Bronx was designated an ''[[All America City]]'' by the [[National Civic League]], signifying its comeback from the decline of the 1970s. In 2006, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that &quot;construction cranes have become the borough's new visual metaphor, replacing the window decals of the 1980s in which pictures of potted plants and drawn curtains were placed in the windows of abandoned buildings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thonx&quot;&gt;

The Bronx also includes several small islands in the [[East River]] and [[Long Island Sound]], such as [[City Island, New York|City Island]] and [[Hart Island (New York)|Hart Island]]. Although it is part of the Bronx, [[Rikers Island]] in the East River, home to the large jail complex for the entire City, can be reached only by water, by air, or—since 1966—over the [[Francis Buono Bridge]] from Queens.

Although, in 2006, it was the third most densely populated county in the United States (after [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;density&quot;/&gt; about one-fifth of the Bronx's area, and one-quarter of its land area, is given over to park land: about {{convert|7000|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;blooming&quot;&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap_travel/20080630/ap_tr_ge/travel_trip_wild_green_bronx Ladies and gentlemen, the Bronx is blooming!] by Beth J.

[[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]], one of the largest cemeteries in New York City, sits on the western bank of the [[Bronx River]] near [[Yonkers]]. It opened in 1863, at a time when the Bronx was still considered a rural area.

The northern side of the borough includes the largest park in New York City - [[Pelham Bay Park]], which includes [[Orchard Beach, New York|Orchard Beach]] - and the fourth largest, [[Van Cortlandt Park]], which is west of Woodlawn Cemetery and borders [[Yonkers]].

Nearer the borough's center, and along the [[Bronx River]], is [[Bronx Park]]. Its northern end houses the [[New York Botanical Gardens]], which preserve the last patch of the original [[hemlock]] forest that once covered the entire city, and its southern end the [[Bronx Zoo]], the largest urban zoological gardens in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;fordzoo&quot;/&gt;

{{See also|List of Bronx neighborhoods|Bronx Community Board|Timeline of town creation in Downstate New York}}

The number, locations and boundaries of the Bronx's neighborhoods (many of them sitting on the sites of 19th-century villages) have become unclear with time and successive waves of newcomers. In 2006, Manny Fernandez of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;According to a [[New York City Department of City Planning|Department of City Planning]] map of the city's neighborhoods, the Bronx has 49. The map publisher Hagstrom identifies 69. The borough president, [[Adolfo Carrión Jr.]], says 61.

East of the [[Bronx River]], the borough is relatively flat, and includes four large low peninsulas or ''necks'' of low-lying land which jut into the waters of the East River and were once saltmarsh: Hunts Point, Clason's Point, Screvin's Neck (Castle Hill Point) and [[Throgs Neck]]. The East Bronx has older tenement buildings, low income public housing complexes, and multifamily homes, as well as smaller and larger single family homes. It includes New York City's largest park: [[Pelham Bay Park]] along the [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]-Bronx border.

[[City Island, Bronx|City Island]] is located east of [[Pelham Bay Park]] in [[Long Island Sound]], and is known for its seafood restaurants and waterfront private homes. City Island's single shopping street, City Island Avenue, is reminiscent of a small New England town. It is connected to [[Rodman's Neck]] on the mainland by the [[City Island Bridge]].

East of City Island is [[Hart Island, New York|Hart Island]] which is uninhabited and not open to the public. It once served as a prison and now houses New York City's [[Potter's Field]] or pauper's graveyard for unclaimed bodies.

The western parts of the Bronx are hillier and are dominated by a series of parallel ridges, running south to north. The West Bronx has older apartment buildings, low income public housing complexes, multifamily homes in its lower income areas as well as larger single family homes in more affluent areas such as [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] and [[Fieldston, Bronx|Fieldston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fpoa.info/images/FPOA_APPROVED_BY-LAWS.doc FIELDSTON PROPERTY OWNERS’ ASSOCIATION, INC.

Like other [[neighborhoods in New York City]], the South Bronx has no official boundaries. The name has been used to represent poverty in the Bronx and applied to progressively more northern places so that by the 2000s [[Fordham Road]] was often used as a northern limit.   The [[Bronx River]] more consistently forms an eastern boundary.  The South Bronx has many high-density apartment buildings, low income public housing complexes, and multi-unit homes. The South Bronx is home to the [[Bronx County Courthouse]], Borough Hall, and other government buildings, as well as [[Yankee Stadium]]. The [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] bisects it, east to west. The South Bronx has some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country, as well as very high crime areas.

Neighborhoods include: [[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]] (a retail district at [[Third Avenue (Manhattan-Bronx)|Third Avenue]] and East 149th Street), [[Port Morris, Bronx|Port Morris]], [[Mott Haven]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 1|Board 1]])'', [[Melrose, Bronx|Melrose]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 1|Board 1]] &amp; [[Bronx Community Board 3|Board 3]])'', [[Morrisania]], [[East Morrisania, Bronx|East Morrisania]] [also known as Crotona Park East] ''([[Bronx Community Board 3|Board 3]])'', [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]], [[Longwood, Bronx|Longwood]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 2|Board 2]])'', [[Highbridge, Bronx|Highbridge]], [[Concourse, Bronx|Concourse]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 4|Board 4]])'', [[West Farms, Bronx|West Farms]], [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]], [[East Tremont, Bronx|East Tremont]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 6|Board 6]])'', [[Tremont, Bronx|Tremont]], [[Morris Heights, Bronx|Morris Heights]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 5|Board 5]])'', [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]], and [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 5|Board 5]] &amp; [[Bronx Community Board 7|Board 7]])''.

==Shopping districts==

Prominent shopping areas in the Bronx include [[Fordham Road]], [[Bay Plaza Shopping Center|Bay Plaza]] (in [[Co-op City]]), [[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]], [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]]/[[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] Shopping center and [[Bruckner Boulevard]]. Shops are also concentrated on streets aligned underneath elevated railroad lines, including Westchester Avenue, White Plains Road, [[Jerome Avenue]], Southern Boulevard and [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]].

=== The Bronx Hub ===


The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District (B.I.D.) is the retail heart of the [[South Bronx]], located where four roads converge: East 149th Street, Willis, Melrose and Third Avenues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/hub/hub.html The Hub]&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily located inside the neighborhood of [[Melrose, Bronx|Melrose]] but also lines the northern border of Mott Haven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehman.edu/vpadvance/artgallery/publicart/neighborhood.htm Bronx Neighborhood Histories]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]] has been called &quot;the Broadway of the Bronx.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therealdeal.net/issues/JULY_2006/1151609191.php Bronx Hub revival gathers steam]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density.

[[Image:Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bronx-Whitestone Bridge]]]]

===Roads and streets===
The Bronx [[street grid]] is irregular. Like the northernmost part of [[upper Manhattan]], the [[West Bronx]]'s hilly terrain leaves a relatively free-style street grid.  Much of the West Bronx's street numbering carries over from upper Manhattan, but does not match it exactly; East 132nd Street is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx.  This dates from the mid-19th century when the southwestern area of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] west of the Bronx River, was incorporated into New York City and known as the Northside.

The [[East Bronx]] is considerably flatter, and the street layout tends to be more regular. Only the [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] neighborhood picks up the street numbering, albeit at a disalignment due to Tremont Avenue's layout. At the same diagonal latitude, West 262nd Street in Riverdale matches East 237th Street in Wakefield.

Three major north-south thoroughfares run between Manhattan and the Bronx: [[Third Avenue (Manhattan-Bronx)|Third Avenue]], [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]], and [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]]. Other major north-south roads include the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], [[Jerome Avenue]], [[Sedgwick Avenue]], [[Webster Avenue]], and [[White Plains Road]]. Major east-west thoroughfares include [[Mosholu Parkway]], [[Gun Hill Road]], [[Fordham Road]], [[Pelham Parkway]], and [[Tremont Avenue]].

Most east-west streets are prefixed with either ''East'' or ''West'', to indicate on which side of Jerome Avenue they lie (continuing the similar system in Manhattan, which uses [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] as the dividing line).

The historic [[Boston Post Road]], part of the long pre-revolutionary road connecting [[Boston]] with other northeastern cities, runs east-west in some places, and sometimes northeast-southwest.

[[Mosholu Parkway|Mosholu]] and [[Pelham Parkway]]s, with [[Bronx Park]] between them, [[Van Cortlandt Park]] to the west and [[Pelham Bay Park]] to the east, are also linked by [[bridle path]]s.

Approximately 61.6% of all Bronx households do not have access to a car. Citywide, the percentage of autoless households is 55%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tstc.org/reports/cpsheets/Bronx_factsheet.pdf Bronx factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Highways===

{{Main|Government and politics of the Bronx}}

===Local government===


{{Main|Government of New York City}}

Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, the Bronx has been governed by the New York City Charter that provides for a [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council system]]. The centralized New York City government is responsible for all municipal functions.

The office of [[Borough President]] was created in the consolidation of 1898 with powers mostly derived from having a vote on the [[New York City Board of Estimate]].  The 1989 [[Board of Estimate of City of New York v. Morris]] case declared the Board unconstitutional, and since 1990 the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the [[New York City Council|City Council]], the New York state government, and corporations.

On February 18, 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] appointed the former Bronx [[Borough President]], [[Adolfo Carrión, Jr.]], to the position of Director of the [[White House Office of Urban Affairs Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kappstatter, Bob, (2/18/09), ''Bronx Beep Bound for D.C.'', New York Daily News&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2009, a special election was held to choose Carrión's successor. Democratic [[New York State Assembly]] member [[Ruben Diaz Jr.|Rubén Díaz, Jr.]], running on the &quot;Bronx Unity&quot; ticket, won this election with 29,420 votes (86%) against 4,646 votes (14%) for the Republican Anthony Ribustello (&quot;People First&quot;) and 11 votes for [[write-in candidate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Trymaine Lee, [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/nyregion/22bronx.html''Borough Voters Elect Díaz as New Borough President]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', New York edition, April 22, 2009, page A24, retrieved on May 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kappstatter, Bob, (4/22/09), ''Ruben Diaz Cruises to Victory in Bronx Borough President Special Election'', New York Daily News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Board of Elections in the City of New York, [http://www.vote.nyc.ny.us/pdf/results/2009/BronxBoroPresident_4_21_09/BronxBoroPresident-Recap.pdf Bronx Borough President special election results, April 21, 2009] ([[PDF]] with details by Assembly District, April 29, 2009), retrieved on May 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 2009, Assemblyman Diaz was sworn in as the 13th Borough President of the Bronx (For his predecessors, see the [[Borough President#Bronx Borough Presidents|List of Bronx Borough Presidents]].)

Every currently-elected public official in the Bronx has first won the [[Democratic Party (U.S.)|Democratic]] nomination (whether or not also nominated by other parties). Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education and economic development. Controversial political issues in the Bronx include environmental issues, the cost of housing, and the alienation of parkland for new [[Yankee Stadium]].

Since its separation from [[New York County]] on January 1, 1914, the Bronx, has had, like each of the other 61 counties of New York State, its own directly-elected [[District attorney|District Attorney]], the county's chief public prosecutor.&lt;ref name=&quot;courtstart&quot;/&gt; Robert T. Johnson, a Democrat, has been the District Attorney of Bronx County since 1989. He was the first African-American District Attorney in New York State.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[Membership of the New York City Council|Eight members]] of the [[New York City Council]] represent districts wholly within the Bronx, while a ninth represents a [[Manhattan]] district (8) that also includes a small area of the Bronx. (All of them were Democrats in 2008.) One of those members, [[Joel Rivera]] (District 15), has been the Council's [[Majority Leader]] since 2002.

The Bronx also has 12 [[Government of New York City#Community Boards|Community Boards]], appointed bodies that field complaints and advise on land use and municipal facilities and services for local residents, businesses and institutions. (They are listed at [[Bronx Community Board]]s).

===Legislative and Congressional representatives===

In 2008, three Democrats represented almost all of the Bronx in the [[United States House of Representatives]].

*[[José M. Serrano]] (first elected in March 1990) represents [[New York's 16th congressional district]], which covers much of the South Bronx. It was, in 2000, the poorest of the nation's 435 districts (42.8% below the poverty line); it was also the most Hispanic of New York state's 29 congressional districts (62.8%) and the youngest (34.5% under 18 years old; 6.7% over 65).

===Votes for other offices===

In the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], Senator [[John F. Kerry]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]/[[Working Families Party|Working Families]]) received 81.8% of the vote in the Bronx while President [[George W. Bush]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]/[[Conservative Party of New York|Conservative]]) received 16.3%.

A year later, the Democratic former Bronx [[Borough President]] [[Fernando Ferrer]] won 59.8% of the borough's vote against 38.8% for Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] (Republican/[[Independence Party of New York|Independence]]) who carried every other borough in his [[New York City mayoral elections#2005|winning campaign for re-election]]. In 2009, the Bronx voted slightly more strongly against the [[New York City mayoral elections#2009|successful re-election]] of Mayor Bloomberg, who received 37% of the Bronx vote (as an independent supported by the Republican and Independence Parties) against 61.2% for [[New York City Comptroller]] [[Bill Thompson (New York)|Bill Thompson]] (Democratic and Working Families).

In 2006, [[United States Senate election in New York, 2006|successfully-reelected]] Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] (Democratic, Working Families &amp; Independence) won 89.5% of the Bronx's vote against 9.6% for [[Yonkers]] ex-Mayor [[John Spencer (politician)|John Spencer]] (Republican and [[Conservative Party of New York|Conservative]]), while [[Eliot Spitzer]] (Democratic, Working Families &amp; Independence) received 88.8% of the Borough's vote in [[New York gubernatorial election, 2006|winning the Governorship]] against [[John Faso]] (Republican &amp; Conservative), who received 9.7% of the Bronx's vote.

In the Presidential primary elections of February 5, 2008, Sen. Clinton won 61.2% of the Bronx's 148,636 Democratic votes against 37.8% for [[Barack Obama]] and 1.0% for the other four candidates combined. At the same time, [[John McCain]] won 54.4% of the borough's 5,643 Republican votes, [[Mitt Romney]] 20.8%, [[Mike Huckabee]] 8.2%, [[Ron Paul]] 7.4%, [[Rudy Giuliani]] 5.6%, and the other three candidates 3.6% between them.&lt;!-- [Names, including nicknames, on ballot as reported by Board of Elections.] --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vote.nyc.ny.us/results.html Board of Elections in the City of New York] Summary of Election Results (1999–2008), retrieved on July 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Presidential general election of November 4, 2008, Sen. Obama won 87.8% of the Bronx's vote (338,261) on the Democratic and Working Families Party lines of the ballot, Sen. McCain won 10.8% (41,683) on the Republican, Independence and Conservative Party lines, and other candidates won 1.3% (1,342) between them. The Democratic candidate's percentage of the Presidential vote increased by 6% from 2004, while the Republican presidential candidate's percentage declined by 5.5%.

After becoming a separate county in 1914, the Bronx has supported only two Republican Presidential candidates. It voted heavily for the winning Republican [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1920, but much more narrowly on a split vote for his victorious Republican successor [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1924 (Coolidge 79,562; [[John W. Davis]], Dem., 72,834; [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]], 62,202 equally divided between the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive]] and [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] lines).

Since then, the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party's nominee for President, starting with a vote of 2–1 for the unsuccessful [[Al Smith]] in 1928, followed by four 2-1 votes for the successful [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. (Both had been Governors of New York, but the Bronx voted against two former Republican Governors who ran for President: [[Charles Evans Hughes]] in 1916 and [[Thomas E. Dewey]] in 1944 and 1948.)&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World Almanac and Book of Facts]]'' for 1929 &amp; 1957; [http://ourcampaigns.com/ContainerHistory.html?ContainerID=9099 Our Campaigns (New York Counties Bronx President History)];''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'' (see [[#Further reading|Further reading]] below), article on &quot;government and politics&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bronx has often shown striking differences from other boroughs in [[New York City mayoral elections|elections for Mayor]]. The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was [[Fiorello La Guardia]] in 1933, 1937 and 1941 (and in the latter two elections, only because his 30–32% vote on the [[American Labor Party]] line was added to 22–23% as a Republican).&lt;ref&gt;(The Republican line exceeded the ALP's in every other borough)&lt;/ref&gt; The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors [[Rudolph Giuliani]] in 1997 and [[Michael Bloomberg]] in 2005. The anti-war [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] campaign of [[Morris Hillquit]] in the [[New York City mayoral election, 1917|1917 mayoral election]] won over 31% of the Bronx's vote, putting him second and well ahead of the 20% won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor [[John P. Mitchel]], who outpolled Hillquit city-wide by 23.2% to 21.7%.&lt;ref&gt;To see a comparison of borough votes for Mayor, see [[New York City mayoral elections#How the Boroughs voted]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{See also|Education in New York City|List of public elementary schools in New York City|Category:Charter schools in New York}}

Education in the Bronx is provided by a large number of public and private institutions, many of which draw students who live beyond the Bronx. The [[New York City Department of Education]] manages public noncharter schools in the borough. In 2000, public schools enrolled nearly 280,000 of the Bronx's residents over 3 years old (out of 333,100 enrolled in all pre-college schools).&lt;ref name=&quot;quicktable&quot;&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=qt&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP19&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&amp;-CONTEXT=qt&amp;-tree_id=403&amp;-all_geo_types=N&amp;-geo_id=05000US36005&amp;-search_results=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en QT-P19.

Private schools range from élite [[independent school]]s to religiously-affiliated [[parochial schools#United States|schools]] run by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]] and Jewish organizations.

'''''Educational attainment:''''' In 2000, according to the [[U.S. Census]], out of the nearly 800,000 people in the Bronx who were then at least 25 years old, 62.3% had graduated from high school and 14.6% held a bachelor's or higher college degree. These percentages were lower than those for New York's other boroughs, which ranged from 68.8% (Brooklyn) to 82.6% (Staten Island) for high school graduates over 24, and from 21.8% (Brooklyn) to 49.4% (Manhattan) for college graduates. (The respective state and national percentages were ''[NY]'' 79.1% &amp; 27.4% and ''[US]'' 80.4% &amp; 24.4%.)&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Census Bureau]], [http://www.census.gov/statab/ccdb/ccdbstcounty.html ''County and City Data Book:2007''], Table B-4.

===High schools===
{{See also|List of high schools in New York City}}
[[Image:BronxScience.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bronx High School of Science]]]]

In the 2000 Census, 79,240 of the nearly 95,000 Bronx residents enrolled in high school attended public schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;quicktable&quot;/&gt;

Many public [[High School#United States|high schools]] are located in the borough including the élite [[Bronx High School of Science]], [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], [[High School for Violin and Dance]], [[Bronx Leadership Academy 2]], [[Bronx International High School]], the [[School for Excellence]], the [[Morris Academy for Collaborative Study]], Wings Academy for young adults, Validus Preparatory Academy, Bronx Expeditionary Learning High School, [[Herbert H. Lehman High School]] and [[High School of American Studies at Lehman College|High School of American Studies]]. The Bronx is also home to three of New York City's most prestigious private, secular schools: [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Fieldston]], [[Horace Mann School|Horace Mann]], and [[Riverdale Country School]].

High schools linked to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] include: [[Saint Raymond's Academy for Girls]], [[All Hallows High School]], [[Fordham Preparatory School]], [[Monsignor Scanlan High School]], [[St. Raymond High School for Boys]], [[Cardinal Hayes High School]], [[Cardinal Spellman High School (New York City)|Cardinal Spellman High School]], [[Academy of Mount St. Ursula High School|The Academy of Mount Saint Ursula]], [[Aquinas High School (New York City)|Aquinas High School]], [[Preston High School (New York City)|Preston High School]], [[St. Catharine Academy]], [[Mount Saint Michael Academy]], and [[St. Barnabas High School]].

The [[SAR Academy]] and [[SAR High School]] are [[Modern Orthodox]] Jewish [[Yeshiva]] coeducational day schools in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], with roots in Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]].

In the 1990s, New York City began closing the large, public high schools in the Bronx and replacing them with small high schools. Among the reasons cited for the changes were poor graduation rates and concerns about safety. Schools that have been closed or reduced in size include [[John F. Kennedy High School (Bronx, New York)|John F. Kennedy]], [[James Monroe High School (New York)|James Monroe]], [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|Taft]], [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (New York City)|Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Adlai E. Stevenson High School (New York City)|Adlai Stevenson]], [[Evander Childs High School|Evander Childs]], [[Christopher Columbus High School (Bronx, New York)|Christopher Columbus]], [[Morris High School (Bronx, New York)|Morris]], [[Walton High School (New York City)|Walton]], and South Bronx High Schools. More recently the City has started phasing out large middle schools, also replacing them with smaller schools.

===Institutions of higher education===

{{See also|List of colleges and universities in New York City}}

In 2000, 49,442 (57.5%) of the 86,014 Bronx residents seeking college, graduate or professional degrees attended public institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;quicktable&quot;/&gt;

Several colleges and universities are located in the Bronx.

[[Fordham University]], was founded as St. John's College in 1841 by the [[Archdiocese of New York|Diocese of New York]] as the first Catholic institution of higher education in the [[Northeast United States|northeast]]. It is now officially an independent institution, but strongly embraces its [[Jesuit]] heritage. The {{convert|85|acre|m2|adj=on}} Bronx campus, known as Rose Hill, is the main campus of the university, and is among the largest within the city (other Fordham campuses are located in Manhattan and Westchester County).&lt;ref name=&quot;fordzoo&quot;&gt;In September 2008, [[Fordham University]] and its neighbor, the Wildlife Conservation Society, a global research organization which operates the [[Bronx Zoo]], will begin a joint program leading to a [[Master of Science]] degree in adolescent science education (biology grades 7–12).&lt;/ref&gt;

Three campuses of the [[City University of New York]] are in the Bronx: [[Hostos Community College]], [[Bronx Community College]] (occupying the former [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]] Campus of [[New York University]]) and Herbert H. [[Lehman College]] (formerly the uptown campus of [[Hunter College]]), which offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees.

The [[College of Mount Saint Vincent]] is a Catholic liberal arts college in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] under the direction of the [[Sisters of Charity of New York]]. Founded in 1847 as a school for girls, the academy became a degree-granting college in 1911 and began admitting men in 1974. The school serves 1,600 students. Its campus is also home to the [[Academy for Jewish Religion (New York)|Academy for Jewish Religion]], a transdenominational rabbinical and cantorial school.

[[Manhattan College]] is a Catholic college in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] which offers undergraduate programs in the arts, business, education, engineering, and science. It also offers graduate programs in education and engineering.

[[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]], part of [[Yeshiva University]], is in [[Morris Park, Bronx|Morris Park]].

Two colleges based in [[Westchester County]] have Bronx campuses. The Catholic and nearly-all-female [[The College of New Rochelle|College of New Rochelle]] maintains satellite campuses at [[Co-op City]] and in [[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]]. The coeducational and non-sectarian [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]] in [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], founded by the Catholic [[Sisters of Mercy]] in 1950, has a campus near [[Westchester Square, Bronx|Westchester Square]].

By contrast, the private, proprietary [[Monroe College]], focused on preparation for business and the professions, started in the Bronx in 1933 but now has a campus in [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] (Westchester County) as well the Bronx's [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monroecollege.edu/aboutmonroe/monroeshistory Monroe College history] (from the College's web site) retrieved on July 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[State University of New York Maritime College]] in [[Fort Schuyler]] ([[Throggs Neck]])—at the far southeastern tip of the Bronx—is the national leader in maritime education and houses the [[Maritime Industry Museum]]. (Directly across [[Long Island Sound]] is [[Kings Point, New York|Kings Point]], Long Island, home of the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]] and the American Merchant Marine Museum.)

The Bronx's evolution from a hot bed of [[Latin jazz]] to an incubator of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] was the subject of an award-winning documentary, produced by [[City Lore]] and broadcast on [[PBS]] in 2006, [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1169817/ &quot;From Mambo to Hip Hop: A South Bronx Tale&quot;]. Hip Hop first emerged in the South Bronx in the early 1970s. ''[[The New York Times]]'' has identified 1520 [[Sedgwick Avenue]] &quot;an otherwise unremarkable high-rise just north of the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] and hard along the [[Major Deegan Expressway]]&quot; as a starting point, where [[DJ Kool Herc]] presided over parties in the community room.&lt;ref&gt;David Gonzalez, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/nyregion/21citywide.html &quot;Will Gentrification Spoil the Birthplace of Hip-Hop?&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 21, 2007, retrieved on July 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Lee, [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/tenants-might-buy-the-birthplace-of-hip-hop &quot;Tenants Might Buy the Birthplace of Hip-Hop&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 15, 2008, retrieved on July 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the advent of beat match DJ'ing, in which Bronx DJs ([[Disc jockey|Disc Jockey]]s) including [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[DJ Kool Herc]] extended the breaks of [[funk]] records, a major new musical genre emerged that sought to isolate the percussion breaks of hit funk, [[disco]] and [[soul music|soul]] songs.  As hip hop's popularity grew, performers began speaking (&quot;[[rapping]]&quot;) in sync with the beats, and became known as MCs or emcees. The [[Herculoids]], made up of Herc, [[Coke La Rock]], and [[DJ Clark Kent]], were the earliest to gain major fame. The Bronx is referred to in hip-hop slang as &quot;The Boogie Down Bronx&quot;, or just &quot;The Boogie Down&quot;.  This was hip-hop pioneer [[KRS-One]]'s inspiration for his thought provoking group BDP, or [[Boogie Down Productions]], which included DJ [[Scott La Rock]]. Newer hip hop artists from the Bronx include [[Peter Gunz|Lord Toriq and Peter Gunz]], [[Swizz Beatz]], [[Drag-On]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Terror Squad (group)|Terror Squad]] and [[Corey Gunz]].&lt;ref&gt;Johan Kugelberg, [http://www.rizzoliusa.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780789315403 ''Born in the Bronx'']; New York: [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]] (Universe), 2007; ISBN 978-0-7893-1540-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bronx is the home of the [[New York Yankees]], one of the leading baseball franchises in sports history. The original [[Yankee Stadium]] opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue, a year which saw the Yankeees bring home their first of 27 World Series Championships. With the famous facade, the short right field porch and Monument Park, Yankee Stadium has played host to many of the greatest players ever to take the field including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Whitey Ford, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Reggie Jackson, Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera and Alex Rodriguez. The Stadium, as referred to by locals, has witnessed of the most memorable moments in sports history such as Lou Gehrig's Farewell Speech in 1939, Joe DiMaggio's 56 game hitting streak in 1941, Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, Roger Maris' record breaking 61st home run in 1961, Reggie Jackson's 3 home runs to clinch Game 6 of the 1977 World Series and more recently the dynasty of the 1996-2000 Yankee club that captured 4 out of 5 World Series victories during that span. The original Yankee Stadium closed in 2008 to make way for a brand new stadium in which the Yankees started play in 2009 and capped off a memorable first year in their new home with a 27th World Series title, by beating the Philadelphia Phillies 4 games to 2 in the Fall Classic. 

The Bronx is home to several [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theaters, many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa. The [http://www.pregones.org/ Pregones Theater], which produces Latin American work, opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002. However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area.

The [[Bronx Museum of the Arts]], founded in 1971, exhibits 20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and {{convert|11000|sqft|m2|-2}} of galleries. Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx. Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art, primarily by artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, including paintings, photographs, prints, drawings, and mixed media. The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm [[Arquitectonica]].

The Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute, in the form of the [[Heinrich Heine]] Memorial, better known as the [[Lorelei]] Fountain from [http://www.business.uiuc.edu/vock/poetry/lorelei.html one of Heine's best-known works (1838)]. After Heine's German birthplace of [[Düsseldorf]] had rejected, allegedly for [[anti-Semitic]] motives, a centennial monument to the radical [[German-Jewish]] poet (1797–1856), his incensed [[German-American]] admirers, including [[Carl Schurz]], started a movement to place one instead in [[Midtown Manhattan]], at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 59th Street. However, this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism, aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional control of public art. In 1899, the memorial, by the [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] sculptor [[Ernst Gustav Herter]] (1846–1917), finally came to rest, although subject to repeated vandalism, in the Bronx, at 164th Street and the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], or [[Joyce Kilmer]] Park near today's [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. (In 1999, it was moved to 161st Street and the Concourse.) In 2007, Christopher Gray of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as &quot;a writhing composition in white Tyrolean marble depicting Lorelei, the mythical German figure, surrounded by mermaids, dolphins and seashells.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Gray,

'''Newspapers'''
The Bronx has several local newspapers, including ''The [[Bronx News]]'' [http://www.bxnews.net], ''[[Parkchester]] News'', ''City News'', ''The [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] Press'', ''[[Riverdale Review]]'', ''The Bronx Times Reporter'', ''[[Inner City Press]]'' [http://www.innercitypress.org/aboutus.html] (which now has more of a focus on national issues) and ''[[Co-Op City]] Times''. Four non-profit news outlets, ''[[Norwood, Bronx|Norwood]] News'', ''Mount Hope Monitor'', ''[[Mott Haven Herald]]'' and ''The [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]] Express'' serve the borough's poorer communities. The editor and co-publisher of ''The Riverdale Press'', Bernard Stein, won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for editorial writing for his editorials about Bronx and New York City issues in 1998. (Stein graduated from the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in 1959.)

The Bronx once had its own daily newspaper, ''The Bronx Home News'', which started publishing on January 20, 1907 and merged into the ''[[New York Post]]'' in 1948. It became a special section of the Post, sold only in the Bronx, and eventually disappeared from view.

'''Radio and television'''
One of New York City's major non-commercial radio broadcasters is [[WFUV]], an [[National Public Radio]]–affiliated 50,000-watt station broadcasting from [[Fordham University]]'s Rose Hill campus in the Bronx. The radio station's antenna is atop an apartment building owned by [[Montefiore Medical Center]].

The City of New York has an official television station run by the [[NYC Media Group]] and broadcasting from [[Bronx Community College]], and [[Cablevision]] operates [[News 12 Networks|News 12 The Bronx]], both of which feature programming based in the Bronx. [[Co-op City]] was the first area in the Bronx, and the first in New York beyond [[Manhattan]], to have its own [[cable television]] provider. The local [[Public-access television]] station [[BronxNet]] provides [[Government-access television]] (GATV) public affairs programming in addition to programming produced by Bronx residents.&lt;ref&gt;Its website showcases very short selections (less than 20 seconds and over 2 MB each in uncompressed [[AIFF]] format) from ''[http://www.bronxnet.org/info/music/bxmusic.htm Bronx Music Vol.1]'', an out-of-press [[compact disc]] of the old and new sounds and artists of the Bronx.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Screen, literature and song==
===On screen (film and television)===

Middle 20th century movies set in the Bronx portrayed densely-settled, working-class, urban culture. [[Paddy Chayefsky]]'s [[Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Marty]]'' is the epitome of this, with its tag line, &quot;What are you doing, Marty? Nothing.&quot; This thematic line has continued in the 1993 [[Robert De Niro]]/[[Chazz Palminteri]] film, ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'', [[Spike Lee]]'s 1999 movie ''[[Summer of Sam]]'', centered in an [[Italian-American]] Bronx community, 1994's ''[[I Like It Like That (film)|I Like It Like That]]'' that takes place in the predominately [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] neighborhood of the South Bronx, and ''Doughboys'', the story of two Italian-American brothers in danger of losing their bakery thanks to one brother's gambling debts.

The Bronx's gritty urban life had worked its way into the movies even earlier, with depictions of the &quot;[[Bronx cheer (gesture)|Bronx cheer]]&quot;, a loud flatulent-like sound of disapproval, allegedly first made by [[New York Yankees]] fans. The sound can be heard, for example, when [[Spike Jones]] sings &quot;Der Fuehrer's Face&quot; (from the 1942 [[Disney]] [[animated film]] of the same name), repeatedly lambasting [[Adolf Hitler]] with: &quot;We'll Heil! (Bronx cheer) Heil! (Bronx cheer) Right in Der Fuehrer's Face!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Hinkley, &quot;Scorn and disdain: Spike Jones giffs Hitler der old birdaphone, 1942.&quot; ''[[New York Daily News]]'',&quot;March 3, 2004.http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/03/03/2004-03-03_scorn_and_disdain_spike_jone.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other movies have also used the term ''Bronx'' for comic effect, such as &quot;Bronx&quot;, the character on the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''.

Starting in the 1970s, the Bronx often symbolized violence, decay, and urban ruin. The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that  &quot;The Bronx is burning&quot;: in 1974 it was the title of both a [[New York Times]] [[editorial]] and a [[BBC]] [[documentary film]]. The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the [[1977 World Series]], when a fire broke out near [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] as the team was playing the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer [[Howard Cosell]] stated, &quot;There it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning&quot;. Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough's decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mahler |first= Jonathan |title= Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |isbn= 0312424302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A new feature-length documentary film by Edwin Pagan called [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906735/ ''Bronx Burning''] is in production&lt;ref&gt;

 |title= Opportunities for Arts Organizations and Community Based Organizations
 |publisher= Bronx Council on the Arts
 |work= E-News Update
 |month=January | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006, chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough.

[[Bronx gangs (1950s-1960s)|Bronx gang life]] was depicted in the 1974 novel ''[[The Wanderers (Richard Price novel)|The Wanderers]]'' by Bronx native [[Richard Price]] and the [[The Wanderers (1979 film)|1979 movie of the same name]]. They are set in the heart of the Bronx, showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor. In the 1979 film ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', the eponymous gang go to a meeting in [[Van Cortlandt Park]] in the Bronx, and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham, Tremont, and &quot;Gunhill&quot; (a play off the name [[Gun Hill Road]]).

This theme lends itself to the title of ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]'', an eight-part [[ESPN]] TV mini-series (2007) about the [[New York Yankees]]' drive to winning baseball's [[1977 World Series]]. The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team, led by manager [[Billy Martin]], catcher [[Thurman Munson]] and outfielder [[Reggie Jackson]], as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time, such as the blackout, the city's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy, the arson for insurance payments, and the election of [[Ed Koch]] as mayor.

The 1981 film ''[[Fort Apache, The Bronx]]'' is another film that used the Bronx's gritty image for its storyline. The movie's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed &quot;Fort Apache&quot;. Also from 1981 is the horror film ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'' making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures. ''[[Knights of the South Bronx]]'', a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children, is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005.

The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film ''[[Fuga dal Bronx]]'', also known as ''Bronx Warriors 2'' and ''Escape 2000'', an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series [[Mystery Science Theatre 3000]].  The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation's plans to depopulate, destroy and redevelop the Bronx, and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation's murderous ways and save their homes.  The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase, &quot;Leave the Bronx!&quot; Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in [[Queens]], substituting as the Bronx.

Bronx born and reared [[Nancy Savoca]]'s 1989 comedy ''[[True Love (1989 film)|True Love]]'', explores two [[Italian-American]] Bronx sweethearts in the days before their wedding. The film, which debuted [[Annabella Sciorra]] and [[Ron Eldard]] as the betrothed couple, won the Grand Jury Prize at that year's [[Sundance Film Festival]].

The [[CBS]] [[television sitcom]] ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', 1998–2004, was more ambiguous. The show starred [[Ted Danson]] as Dr. John Becker, a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients, co-workers, friends, and practically everything and everybody else in his world. It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx.

[[Penny Marshall]]'s 1990 film ''[[Awakenings]]'', which was nominated for several [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], is based on neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]]' [[Awakenings (book)|1973 account]] of his psychiatric patients at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx who were paralyzed by a form of [[encephalitis]] but briefly responded to the drug [[L-dopa]]. [[Robin Williams]] played the physician; [[Robert De Niro]] was one of the patients who emerged from a [[Catatonia|catatonic]] (frozen) state. The home of Williams' character was shot not far from Sacks' actual [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]] residence. A 1973 [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E3D8103DF932A15752C0A9679C8B63 Yorkshire Television documentary] and &quot;A Kind of Alaska&quot;, a 1985 play by [[Harold Pinter]],&lt;ref&gt;(ISBN 0-573-12129-X)&lt;/ref&gt; were also based on Sacks' book.

[[Gus Van Sant]]'s 2000 ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' was quickly billed &quot;[[Good Will Hunting]] in the Hood.&quot; [[Sean Connery]] is in the title role of a reclusive old man who 50 years earlier wrote a single novel that garnered the [[Pulitzer Prize]].  He meets 16 year old Jamal – actor Rob Brown – a gifted, Bronx reared basketball player and aspiring writer, and becomes his mentor. The movie includes stock footage of Bronx housing projects from 1990, as well as some other scenes shot in Manhattan and Brooklyn.

===In literature ===
The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature. All of the characters in [[Herman Wouk]]'s [[City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder]] (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there.  Kate Simon's ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood'' is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near [[Arthur Avenue]] and [[Tremont Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;Kate Simon, ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood.'' New York: Harper Colophon, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jacob M. Appel's short story, &quot;The Grand Concourse&quot; (2007),&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Threepenny Review]]'', [http://www.threepennyreview.com/tocs/109_sp07.html Volume 109, Spring 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who grew up the in the iconic [[Lewis Morris]] Building returns to the [[Morrisania]] neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in [[Avery Corman]]'s book ''The Old Neighborhood'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;[[Avery Corman]], ''The Old Neighborhood'', [[Simon and Schuster]], 1980; ISBN 0-671-41475-5&lt;/ref&gt; an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ([[Fordham Road]] and the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]]), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people.

By contrast, [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities|Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Tom Wolfe, ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'', [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] 1987 (hardback) ISBN 978-0-374-11535-7, Picador Books 2008 (paperback) ISBN 978-0-312-42757-3&lt;/ref&gt; portrays a wealthy, white protagonist, Sherman McCoy, getting lost off the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] in the [[South Bronx]] and having an altercation with locals. A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Court House. However, times change, and in 2007, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that &quot;the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments.&quot; In the same article, the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] (whose fictional analogue in the novel is &quot;Reverend Bacon&quot;) asserts that &quot;twenty years later, the cynicism of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' is as out of style as [[Tom Wolfe]]'s wardrobe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Barnard, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/10/nyregion/10bonfire.html Twenty Years After 'Bonfire,' A City No Longer in Flames], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 10, 2007, retrieved on July 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don DeLillo]]'s ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]'' (1997) is also set in the Bronx and offers a perspective on the decline of the area from the 1950s onwards.  [[John Patrick Shanley]]'s &quot;Savage in Limbo&quot; is set in a 1980s Bronx bar called 'Scales' where the frustrated characters feel they are unable to move.

In poetry, the Bronx has been immortalized by one of the world's shortest [[couplet]]s:
: The Bronx
: No Thonx
:: [[Ogden Nash]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 1931

Nash repented 33 years after his [[calumny]], penning in 1964 the following [[prose poem]] to the Dean of [[Bronx Community College]]:
:I can't seem to escape
:the sins of my smart-alec youth;
:Here are my amends.
:I wrote those lines, &quot;The Bronx?
:No thonx&quot;;
:I shudder to confess them.
:Now I'm an older, wiser man
:I cry, &quot;The Bronx? God
:bless them!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thonx&quot;/&gt;

===In song===
'''''Passing through:''''' The theme song to the 1960s U.S. television comedy series ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]]'' begins &quot;There's a holdup in the Bronx.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[[Car 54, Where Are You?#Theme song]]&lt;/ref&gt; And the song &quot;[[New York, New York (On The Town)|New York, New York]]&quot; (by [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]] from the 1940s [[On the Town (musical)|musical comedy]] and [[On the Town (film)|film]], &quot;On the Town&quot;) explains that &quot;The Bronx is up and [[Battery Park|the Battery]]'s down.&quot; Another song, &quot;[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]&quot; (by [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]] for the 1925 musical &quot;Garrick Gaieties&quot;), declares &quot;We'll have Manhattan,/The Bronx and Staten/Island too./It's lovely going through/the zoo.&quot;

'''''Bronx Local:''''' While hundreds of songs about New York City, Manhattan and Brooklyn can be found in Wikipedia's [[List of songs about New York City]] and also in Marc Ferris's 5-page, 15-column list of &quot;Songs and Compositions Inspired by New York City&quot; in ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'' (1995),&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'', edited by [[Kenneth T. Jackson]] ([[Yale University Press]] and The [[New-York Historical Society]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]], 1995 ISBN 0-300-05536-6), pages 1091–1095&lt;/ref&gt; only a handful refer to the Bronx.

'''BearShare''' is a [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] application originally created by Free Peers, Inc. for [[Microsoft Windows]], and now sold by MusicLab, LLC ([[iMesh]]).

== History ==
Bearshare was a [[Gnutella]]-based peer-to-peer file sharing application, with a support forum.  The original operators of Free Peers, Inc. were Vincent Falco and Louis Tatta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=1176 BearShare History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the June 27, 2005 [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision on the ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.]]'' case the BearShare support forums were closed.

On May 4, 2006, Free Peers agreed to pay $30 million in a settlement with the [[RIAA]] and transfer all their BearShare-related assets to MusicLab, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.slyck.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=22181 | title = BearShare Settles | publisher = Slyck.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; (an [[iMesh]] subsidiary).

On August 17, 2006, MusicLab released BearShare v6, a new application unrelated to the original, which does not use the [[Gnutella]] protocol at all, but instead operates on the same network as the [[iMesh]] client.

In August 2006, MusicLab released another version optimized for video download called BearFlix. The first release was version 1.2.1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soft82.com/download/Windows/BearFlix Soft82 release history]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 2008, Bearshare v7 with [[iPod]] support was released.

== Versions ==
Three variations of the original BearShare [[gnutella]] [[servent]] were distributed by Free Peers: Free, Lite and Pro. The Free version had higher performance limits than the Lite version but also contained some [[adware]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/windows/BearShare-Review-14307.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zeropaid.com/bearsharelite/&lt;/ref&gt; The Lite version was adware-free but had lower performance limits than the Free version. The Pro version had higher limits than both the Free and Lite versions but cost [[United States dollar|US$]]24. Version numbers in this series ranged from 1.0 to 5.2.5.9.

A variant of the original BearShare [[gnutella]] servent, called BearFlix,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bearflix.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is altered to limit sharing, searches and downloads to images and videos&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bearflix.com/help/faq.php?section=BearShare_users#Q3&lt;/ref&gt; which are limited in length and duration.  Though its version numbers appear to start from 1.1.2.1 in the user interface it presents itself on the gnutella network as versions 6.1.2.1 and up.  It is offered in Basic and Pro ([[United States dollar|US$]]19) versions with similar variations in performance limits&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bearflix.com/downloads_basic.php&lt;/ref&gt; as the corresponding BearShare versions, Lite and Pro.  There is no Free (adware-supported) version in the BearFlix series.

MusicLab's BearShare v6 and later offer paid music downloads in the [[Digital rights management|DRM]]ed [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]] format as well as free content in various formats, mostly MP3.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bearshare.com/helpfiles/html/TypesofMediaContentinBearshare.html&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes social networking features, somewhat similar to [[MySpace]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bearshare.com/helpIM.html&lt;/ref&gt; The free content is shared by users and is automatically verified by BearShare not to infringe. This verification is done using [[acoustic fingerprinting]]. Also, video files more than 50mb in size and 15 minutes in length cannot be shared, guaranteeing feature-length releases cannot be transferred across the network. No other content than music and video files can be shared, which excludes executable files and zip archives amongst others.

'''Belgium''' ({{IPAc-en|en-us-Belgium.ogg|ˈ|b|ɛ|l|dʒ|əm}} {{respell|BEL|jəm}}), officially the '''Kingdom of Belgium''', is a [[Federation|federal]] [[sovereign state|state]] in Western [[Europe]]. It is a founding member of the [[European Union]] and hosts the EU's headquarters, as well as those of several other major international organisations such as [[NATO]].&lt;ref
 name=&quot;Note-1&quot;&gt;Belgium is also a member of, or affiliated to, many international organisations, including [[Agence de Coopération Culturelle et Technique|ACCT]], [[AfDB]], [[AsDB]], [[Australia Group]], [[Benelux]], [[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]], [[Convention on Cybercrime|CCC]], [[Council of Europe|CE]], [[CERN]], [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council|EAPC]], [[EBRD]], [[European Investment Bank|EIB]], [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]], [[ESA]], EU, [[FAO]], [[Group of Ten (economic)|G-10]], [[IAEA]], [[IBRD]], [[ICAO]], [[International Criminal Court|ICC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[Inter-American Development Bank|IDB]], [[International Energy Agency|IEA]], [[IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[IFRCS]], [[IHO]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[IMF]], [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]], [[IMSO]], [[Intelsat]], [[Interpol]], [[IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[ITU]], [[MONUC]] (observers), [[NATO]], [[Nuclear Energy Agency|NEA]], [[Nuclear Suppliers Group|NSG]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]] (observer), [[OECD]], [[OPCW]], [[OSCE]], [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]], UN, [[UNCTAD]], [[UNECE]], [[UNESCO]], [[UNHCR]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[UNMIK]], [[UNMOGIP]], [[UNRWA]], [[UNTSO]], [[UPU]], [[West African Development Bank|WADB]] (non-regional), [[WEU]], [[WHO]], [[WIPO]], [[WMO]], [[WTrO]], [[Zangger Committee|ZC]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Belgium covers an area of {{convert|30528|km2|sqmi}}, and it has a population of about 11&amp;nbsp;million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Latin Europe]], Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups, the [[Dutch language|Dutch-speakers]], mostly [[Flemish people|Flemish]], and the [[Francophone|French-speakers]], mostly [[Walloons]], plus a small group of [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speakers]]. Belgium's two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of [[Flemish Region|Flanders]] in the north and the French-speaking southern region of [[Wallonia]]. The [[Brussels-Capital Region]], officially bilingual, is a mostly French-speaking [[List of enclaves and exclaves#Subnational enclaves which are not exclaves|enclave]] within the Flemish Region.&lt;ref

Historically, Belgium, the [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]] were known as the [[Low Countries]], which used to cover a somewhat larger area than the current [[Benelux]] group of states.  The region was called Belgica in Latin because of the [[Roman province]] [[Gallia Belgica]] which covered more or less the same area. From the end of the [[Middle Ages]] until the 17th century, it was a prosperous centre of commerce and culture. From the 16th century until the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830, when Belgium seceded from the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], many battles between European powers were fought in the area of Belgium, causing it to be dubbed the battleground&lt;!-- Please don't replace with [[cockfight|cockpit]] without discussing on the talk page --&gt; of Europe,&lt;ref

The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern [[Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands|United Provinces]] (''Belgica Foederata'' in [[Latin]], the &quot;Federated Netherlands&quot;) and the [[Southern Netherlands]] (''Belgica Regia'', the &quot;Royal Netherlands&quot;). The latter were ruled successively by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and the [[History of Austria#Charles VI and Maria Theresa (1711–1780)|Austrian]] [[Habsburg]]s and comprised most of modern Belgium.

The reunification of the Low Countries as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] occurred at the dissolution of the [[First French Empire]] in 1815.

The 1830 [[Belgian Revolution]] led to the establishment of a Catholic and bourgeois, officially French-speaking and neutral, independent Belgium under a [[Provisional Government of Belgium|provisional government]] and a [[national Congress of Belgium|national congress]].&lt;ref

Since the installation of [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold&amp;nbsp;I]] as king in 1831, Belgium has been a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]], with a [[Laïcité|laicist]] constitution based on the [[Napoleonic code]]. Although the franchise was initially restricted, [[universal suffrage]] for men was introduced after the [[Belgian general strike of 1893|general strike of 1893]] (with [[plural voting]] until 1919) and for women in 1949.

The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 ceded control of the [[Congo Free State]] to [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold&amp;nbsp;II]] as his private possession. From around 1900 there was growing international concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the Congolese population under Leopold&amp;nbsp;II, for whom the Congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production. In 1908 this outcry led the Belgian state to assume responsibility for the government of the colony, henceforth called the [[Belgian Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;

Germany invaded Belgium in 1914 as part of the [[Schlieffen Plan]] and much of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] fighting of World War&amp;nbsp;I occurred in western parts of the country. The opening months of the war were known as the [[Rape of Belgium]] due to German atrocities. Belgium took over the [[German colonies]] of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (modern day [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]) during the war, and they were mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the [[League of Nations]]. In the aftermath of the First World War, the [[districts of Prussia|Prussian districts]] of [[Eupen-Malmedy|Eupen and Malmedy]] were annexed by Belgium in 1925, thereby causing the presence of a German-speaking minority.

[[Battle of Belgium|The country was again invaded by Germany in 1940]] and was occupied until its [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|liberation by the Allies]] in 1944. After World War&amp;nbsp;II, [[General strike against Leopold III of Belgium|a general strike]] forced king [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold&amp;nbsp;III]], who many saw as collaborating with the Germans during the war, to abdicate in 1951.

Ruanda-Urundi followed with its independence two years later. Belgium joined [[NATO]] as a founding member and formed the Benelux group of nations with the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Belgium became one of the six founding members of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] in 1951 and of the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] and [[European Economic Community]], established in 1957. The latter is now the European Union, for which Belgium hosts major administrations and institutions, including the [[European Commission]], the [[Council of the European Union]] and the extraordinary and committee sessions of the [[European Parliament]].

Spain's representatives usually mastered French but not Dutch; a notable part of the nobles at the court came from Wallonia, which had taken party for the Spanish side to a higher extent than Flanders and Brabant.

# The [[Belgian federal government|federal government]], based in Brussels.
# The three language communities:
#* the [[Flemish Community]] (Dutch-speaking);
#* the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] (French-speaking);
#* the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]].
# The three regions:
#* the [[Flemish Region]], subdivided into five [[provinces of Belgium|provinces]];
#* the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]], subdivided into five provinces;
#* the [[Brussels-Capital Region]].

The [[Language legislation in Belgium|constitutional language areas]] determine the official languages in their municipalities, as well as the geographical limits of the empowered institutions for specific matters.&lt;ref name=Fitzmaurice1996-p121&gt;Fitzmaurice (1996), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments, when the Communities and Regions were created in 1980, Flemish politicians decided to merge both.&lt;ref name=Fitzmaurice1996-p122&gt;Fitzmaurice (1996), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Flemings just have one single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;OneFlemishBody&quot;&gt;Footnote: The Constitution set out seven institutions each of which can have a parliament, government and administration. In fact there are only six such bodies because the Flemish Region merged into the Flemish Community. This single Flemish body thus exercises powers about Community matters in the bilingual area of Brussels-Capital and in the Dutch language area, while about Regional matters only in the latter.&lt;/ref&gt;

The overlapping boundaries of the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: the territory of the Brussels-Capital Region (which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions) is included in both the Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the German-speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region. Conflicts jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the [[Constitutional Court of Belgium]]. The structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzmaurice&quot;/&gt;

The Federal State's authority includes justice, defence, federal police, social security, nuclear energy, monetary policy and public debt, and other aspects of public finances. State-owned companies include the [[Belgian Post Group]] and [[National Railway Company of Belgium|Belgian Railways]]. The Federal Government is responsible for the obligations of Belgium and its federalized institutions towards the European Union and NATO. It controls substantial parts of public health, home affairs and foreign affairs.&lt;ref name=fedgov1&gt;{{cite web

Communities exercise their authority only within linguistically determined geographical boundaries, originally oriented towards the individuals of a Community's language: culture (including audiovisual media), education and the use of the relevant language.

Regions have authority in fields that can be broadly associated with their territory. These include economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit and foreign trade. They supervise the provinces, municipalities and intercommunal utility companies.&lt;ref name=fedgov2/&gt;

In several fields, the different levels each have their own say on specifics. With education, for instance, the autonomy of the Communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor allows for setting minimum requirements for awarding qualifications, which remain federal matters.&lt;ref name=fedgov1/&gt; Each level of government can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers.&lt;ref

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Belgium}}
[[File:Diksmuide - Polders - IJzer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Polder]]s along the [[Yser]] river]]

Belgium shares borders with France ({{nowrap|620&amp;nbsp;km}}), Germany ({{nowrap|167&amp;nbsp;km}}), [[Luxembourg]] ({{nowrap|148&amp;nbsp;km}}) and the [[Netherlands]] ({{nowrap|450&amp;nbsp;km}}). Its total area, including surface water area, is 33,990 square kilometres; land area alone is 30,528&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It lies between latitudes 49° and 53° N, and longitudes 2° and 7° E.

Belgium has three main geographical regions: the coastal plain in the north-west and the central plateau both belong to the Anglo-Belgian Basin; the [[Ardennes]] uplands in the south-east are part of the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian orogenic belt]]. The [[Paris Basin (geology)|Paris Basin]] reaches a small fourth area at Belgium's southernmost tip, [[Belgian Lorraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and [[polder]]s. Further inland lies a smooth, slowly rising landscape irrigated by numerous waterways, with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the [[Campine]] (''Kempen''). The thickly forested hills and plateaus of the Ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small [[canyon|gorges]]. Extending westward into France, this area is eastwardly connected to the [[Eifel]] in Germany by the [[High Fens]] plateau, on which the [[Signal de Botrange]] forms the country's highest point at {{convert|694|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mirroring the dual structure of the 19th-century Belgian political landscape, characterized by the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal]] and the [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic parties]], the educational system is segregated within a secular and a religious segment. The secular branch of schooling is controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, while religious, mainly [[Catholic school|Catholic branch]] education, is organised by religious authorities, although subsidized and supervised by the communities.&lt;ref

Since the country's independence, Roman Catholicism, counterbalanced by strong [[freethought]] movements, has had an important role in Belgium's politics.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[s:en:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Belgium|Belgium]] entry of the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; However Belgium is largely a [[secular]] country as the ''[[laicite|laicist]]'' [[Constitution of Belgium|constitution]] provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. During the reigns of [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert&amp;nbsp;I]] and [[Baudouin I of Belgium|Baudouin]], the monarchy had a reputation of deeply rooted Catholicism.&lt;ref name=MarshallCavendish2009/&gt; Roman Catholicism has traditionally been Belgium's majority religion; being especially strong in Flanders. However, by 2009 Sunday church attendance was 5.4% in Flanders compared to 12.7% in 1998 (sunday church attandance was 11.2% for the total of Belgium in 1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=3932PEIJ Kerken lopen zeer geleidelijk helemaal leeg]  newsarticle in Dutch describing church attendance in Flanders&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite an 8% drop in Sunday church attendance over this nine-year period, Catholicism nevertheless remains an important force in society.&lt;ref name=MarshallCavendish2009&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2009|author=P.

===Health===
The Belgians are known to enjoy good health. Their life expectancy numbered 79.5 years in 2004. Since 1960, life expectancy has, in line with the European average, grown by two months per year.  Death is in Belgium mainly due to heart and vascular disorders, [[neoplasm]]s, disorders of the respiratory system and unnatural causes of death (accidents, suicide).  Non-natural causes of death and cancer are the most common causes of death for females up to age 24 and males up age 44.&lt;ref name=Corens2007&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Health Systems in Transition |volume=9 |number=2 |year=2007 |title=Belgium, health system review |author=Dirk Corens |publisher=European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/96442/E90059.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Health_care_systems#Belgium|Health care]] is of  high quality and is financed through both social security contributions and taxation.  Health insurance is compulsory.  However health care is delivered by a mostly private system of independent medical practitioners and hospitals.  Most of the time each provided service is directly paid by the patient and reimbursed later on by health insurance companies.&lt;ref name=Corens2007/&gt; Belgian health care system is supervised and financed by the federal government, the three Communities and the three Regions, i.e. six distinct Ministries (the Flemish Community and Region have merged).&lt;ref name=Corens2007/&gt;

Folklore plays a major role in Belgium's cultural life: the country has a comparatively high number of processions, cavalcades, parades, 'ommegangs' and 'ducasses',&lt;ref&gt;The Dutch word 'ommegang' is here used in the sense of an entirely or mainly non-religious procession, or the non-religious part thereof—see also [[:nl:Ommegang|its article on the Dutch-language Wikipedia]]; the Processional Giants [http://www.visitbelgium.com/mediaroom/Ommegang.htm of Brussels]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}, Dendermonde and Mechelen mentioned in this paragraph are part of each city's 'ommegang'. The French word 'ducasse' refers also to a procession; the mentioned Processional Giants of Ath and Mons are part of each city's 'ducasse'.&lt;/ref&gt; '[[kermesse (festival)|kermesse]]' and other local festivals, nearly always with an originally religious or [[mythology of the Low Countries|mythological background]]. The [[Carnival of Binche]] with its famous [[Gilles]] and the 'Processional Giants and Dragons' of [[Ath]], [[Brussels]], [[Dendermonde]], [[Mechelen]] and [[Mons]] are recognised by [[UNESCO]] as [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Blues''' is the name given to both a [[musical form]] and a [[music genre]]&lt;ref&gt;Kunzler's dictionary of Jazz provides two separate entries: blues, an originally African-American genre (p.128), and the blues form, a widespread musical form (p.131).&lt;/ref&gt; that originated in [[African-American]] communities of primarily the [[Deep South]] of the United States at the end of the 19th century from [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[work song]]s, [[field holler]]s, [[Ring shout|shouts]] and [[chant]]s, and rhymed simple narrative [[ballad (music)|ballads]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Evolution of Differing Blues Styles&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Evolution of Differing Blues Styles  |publisher=How To Play Blues Guitar |accessdate=2008-08-11 |url=http://how-to-play-blues-guitar.com/the-blues/the-evolution-of-different-blues-styles/| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5msLYV7tu | archivedate = 2010-01-18| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blues form, ubiquitous in [[jazz]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[rock and roll]], is characterized by specific chord progressions, of which the [[twelve-bar blues]] chord progression is the most common. The [[blue note]]s that, for expressive purposes are sung or played flattened or gradually bent (minor 3rd to major 3rd) in relation to the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of the [[major scale]], are also an important part of the sound.

The blues genre is based on the blues form but possesses other characteristics such as specific lyrics, bass lines and instruments. Blues can be subdivided into several [[List of blues genres|subgenres]] ranging from [[country blues|country]] to urban blues that were more or less popular during different periods of the 20th century. Best known are the [[Delta blues|Delta]], [[Piedmont blues|Piedmont]], [[Jump blues|Jump]] and [[Chicago blues]] styles. [[World War II]] marked the transition from acoustic to [[electric blues]] and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience. In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called [[blues-rock]] evolved.

The term &quot;the blues&quot; refers to the &quot;blue devils&quot;, meaning melancholy and sadness; an early use of the term in this sense is found in [[George Colman the Younger|George Colman]]'s one-act farce ''Blue Devils'' (1798).&lt;ref&gt;The &quot;Trésor de la Langue Française informatisé&quot; provides this etymology to the word blues and George Colman's farce as the first appearance of this term in the English language, see {{cite web |url=http://atilf.atilf.fr/dendien/scripts/fast.exe?mot=blues |title=Blues |publisher=Centre Nationale de Ressources Textuelles et Lixicales |accessdate=15 October 2010| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5msLYsJNm | archivedate = 2010-01-18| deadurl=no}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the use of the phrase in [[African-American music]] may be older, it has been attested to since 1912, when [[Hart Wand]]'s &quot;[[Dallas Blues]]&quot; became the first copyrighted blues composition.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Francis. ''The History of the Blues''. New York: Hyperion, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Partridge, ''A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'', 2002, Routledge (UK), ISBN 978-0-415-29189-7&lt;/ref&gt;  In lyrics the phrase is often used to describe a [[Depression (mood)|depressed mood]].&lt;ref&gt;Tony Bolden, ''Afro-Blue: Improvisations in African American Poetry and Culture'', 2004, [[University of Illinois Press]], ISBN 978-0-252-02874-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
The blues form is a [[cyclic form|cyclic musical form]] which repeating [[chord progression|progression of chords]] mirrors the [[call and response (music)|call and response]] scheme ubiquitous in African and African-American music.  During the first decades of the 20th century, blues music was not clearly defined in terms of a particular chord progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are also [[16-bar blues]], as in [[Ray Charles]]'s instrumental &quot;Sweet 16 Bars&quot; and in [[Herbie Hancock]]'s &quot;[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]&quot;. Idiosyncratic numbers of bars are also encountered occasionally, as with the 9-bar progression in &quot;[[Sitting on Top of the World]]&quot; by Howlin Wolf.

The basic 12-bar lyric framework of a blues composition is reflected by a standard harmonic progression of 12 bars in a [[Time signature|4/4 time signature]]. The blues [[Chord (music)|chords]] associated to a [[twelve-bar blues]] are typically a set of three different chords played over a 12-bar scheme. They are labeled by [[Roman number]]s referring to the [[degree (music)|degrees]] of the progression. For instance, for a blues in the key of C, C is the [[tonic chord]] (I) and F is the [[subdominant chord|subdominant]] (IV). The last chord is the [[dominant chord|dominant]] (V) [[turnaround (music)|turnaround]], marking the transition to the beginning of the next progression. The lyrics generally end on the last beat of the tenth bar or the first beat of the 11th bar, and the final two bars are given to the instrumentalist as a break; the harmony of this two-bar break, the turnaround, can be extremely complex, sometimes consisting of single notes that defy analysis in terms of chords.

Much of the time, some or all of these chords are played in the [[harmonic seventh]] (7th) form. The use of the harmonic seventh interval is characteristic of blues and is popularly called the &quot;blues seven&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ellen Fullman, &quot;The Long String Instrument&quot;, ''MusicWorks'', Issue #37 Fall 1987 | url=http://www.deepmedia.org/ellenfullman/mw85/fullman_article.pdf}} {{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blues seven chords add to the harmonic chord a note with a frequency in a 7:4 ratio to the fundamental note. At a 7:4 ratio, it is not close to any interval on the conventional Western [[diatonic scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Jazz Improvisation Almanac, Outside Shore Music Online School | url=http://www.outsideshore.com/school/music/almanac/html/Music_Theory/Jazz_Scales/Blues_And_Bebop_Scales/Blues_Scale.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; For convenience or by necessity it is often approximated by a [[minor seventh]] interval or a [[dominant seventh]] chord.

[[File:A minor pentatonic scale.svg|thumb|350px|A minor [[pentatonic scale]]; {{Audio|PentMinor.mid|play}}]]

In [[melody]], blues is distinguished by the use of the [[Flat (music)|flattened]] [[minor third|third]], [[tritone|fifth]] and [[minor seventh|seventh]] of the associated [[major scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, pg. 143&lt;/ref&gt; These specialized notes are called the [[blue note|''blue'' or ''bent notes'']]. These scale tones may replace the natural scale tones, or they may be added to the scale, as in the case of the minor blues scale, in which the flattened third replaces the natural third, the flattened seventh replaces the natural seventh and the flattened fifth is added between the natural fourth and natural fifth. While the 12-bar harmonic progression had been intermittently used for centuries, the revolutionary aspect of blues was the frequent use of the flattened third, flattened seventh, and even flattened fifth in the melody, together with ''crushing''—playing directly adjacent notes at the same time (i.e., diminished second)—and ''sliding'', similar to using [[grace note]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Grace notes were common in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical music era|Classical]] periods, but they acted as ornamentation rather than as part of the harmonic structure. For example, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Piano Concerto No. 21 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 21]]'' has a flatted fifth in the dominant. In these periods, this was a technique for building tension for resolution into the perfect fifth; in contrast, a blues melody uses the flatted fifth as part of the scale.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blue notes allow for key moments of expression during the cadences, melodies, and embellishments of the blues.

Blues [[shuffle note|shuffles]] or [[walking bass]] reinforce the trance-like rhythm and call-and-response, and they form a repetitive effect called a [[groove (popular music)|groove]]. Characteristic of the blues since its Afro-American origins, the shuffles played a central role in [[swing music]].&lt;ref&gt;Kunzler, pg. 1065&lt;/ref&gt;  The simplest shuffles, which were the clearest signature of the R&amp;B wave that started in the mid 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;Barry Pearson, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 316&lt;/ref&gt; were a three-note [[riff]] on the bass strings of the guitar. When this riff was played over the bass and the drums, the groove &quot;feel&quot; was created. Shuffle rhythm is often vocalized as &quot;''dow'', da ''dow'', da ''dow'', da&quot; or &quot;''dump'', da ''dump'', da ''dump'', da&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;David Hamburger, ''Acoustic Guitar Slide Basics'', 2001, ISBN 978-1-890490-38-6.&lt;/ref&gt; it consists of uneven, or &quot;swung,&quot; eighth notes. On a guitar this may be played as a simple steady bass or it may add to that stepwise quarter note motion from the fifth to the sixth of the chord and back. An example is provided by the following guitar [[tablature]] for the first four bars of a blues                                             progression in E:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lesson 72: Basic Blues Shuffle by Jim Burger | url=http://www.wholenote.com/default.asp?src=l&amp;l=72&amp;p=1  |accessdate=November 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur M.

[[File:RobertJohson.png|thumb|right|175px|[[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], an influential [[Delta blues]] musician]]

The lyrics of early [[traditional blues verse]]s probably often consisted of a single line repeated four times; it was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the so-called AAB pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, pg. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the first published blues songs, &quot;[[Dallas Blues]]&quot; (1912) and &quot;[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]&quot; (1914), were 12-bar blues featuring the AAB structure. [[W. C. Handy]] wrote that he adopted this convention to avoid the monotony of lines repeated three times.&lt;ref&gt;Father of the Blues: An Autobiography. by W.C. Handy, edited by Arna Bontemps: foreword by Abbe Niles. Macmillan Company, New York; (1941) page 143. no ISBN in this first printing&lt;/ref&gt; The lines are often sung following a pattern closer to a [[talking blues|rhythmic talk]] than to a melody. Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative. The singer voiced his or her &quot;personal woes in a world of harsh reality: a lost love, the cruelty of police officers, oppression at the hands of white folk, [and] hard times.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, pgs. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt; This melancholy has led to the suggestion of an [[Igbo music|Igbo]] origin for blues because of the reputation the [[Igbo American|Igbo]] had throughout plantations in the Americas for their melancholic music and outlook to life when they were enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=They all played ragtime, the true story of an American music |first1=Rudi |last1=Blesh |first2=Harriet Grossman |last2=Janis |publisher=Sidgwick &amp; Jackson |page=186 |year=1958 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=awHY-w8_iTsC&amp;pg=PA186|isbn=9781443731522}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture: Ethnicity |first1=James G. |last1=Thomas (Jr.) |page=166 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=2007|isbn=978-0-8078-5823-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lyrics often relate troubles experienced within African American society. For instance [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]]'s &quot;Rising High Water Blues&quot; (1927) tells about the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]]:

: &quot;Backwater rising, Southern peoples can't make no time
: I said, backwater rising, Southern peoples can't make no time
: And I can't get no hearing from that Memphis girl of mine.&quot;

However, although the blues gained an association with misery and oppression, the lyrics could also be humorous and raunchy as well:&lt;ref&gt;
Komara, pg. 476
&lt;/ref&gt;

: &quot;Rebecca, Rebecca, get your big legs off of me,
: Rebecca, Rebecca, get your big legs off of me,
: It may be sending you baby, but it's worrying the hell out of me.&quot;

Explicit contents led to blues sometimes being called [[dirty blues]]. Lyrical content of music became slightly simpler in post war-blues which focused almost exclusively on relationship woes or sexual worries. Many lyrical themes that frequently appeared in pre-war blues such as economic depression, farming, devils, gambling, magic, floods and dry periods were less common in post-war blues.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, pg. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
{{Main|Origins of the blues}}
The first publication of blues sheet music was [[Hart Wand]]'s &quot;[[Dallas Blues]]&quot; in 1912; [[W. C. Handy]]'s &quot;[[The Memphis Blues]]&quot; followed in the same year. The first recording by an African American singer was [[Mamie Smith]]'s 1920 rendition of [[Perry Bradford]]'s &quot;Crazy Blues&quot;. But the origins of the blues date back to some decades earlier, probably around 1890.&lt;ref&gt;David Evans, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  They are very poorly documented, due in part to racial discrimination within American society, including academic circles,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kunzler, pg. 130&quot;&gt;Kunzler, pg. 130&lt;/ref&gt; and to the low literacy rate of the rural African American community at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Bastin, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Chroniclers began to report about blues music in [[Southern Texas]] and [[Deep South]] at the dawn of the 20th century. In particular, Charles Peabody mentioned the appearance of blues music at [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]] and Gate Thomas reported very similar songs in southern Texas around 1901–1902. These observations coincide more or less with the remembrance of [[Jelly Roll Morton]], who declared having heard blues for the first time in [[New Orleans]] in 1902; [[Ma Rainey]], who remembered her first blues experience the same year in [[Missouri]]; and [[W.C. Handy]], who first heard the blues in [[Tutwiler, Mississippi]] in 1903. The first extensive research in the field was performed by [[Howard W. Odum]], who published a large anthology of folk songs in the counties of [[Lafayette County, Mississippi|Lafayette, Mississippi]] and [[Newton County, Georgia|Newton, Georgia]] between 1905 and 1908.&lt;ref&gt;David Evans, in Nothing but the blues, pgs. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt; The first non-commercial recordings of blues music, termed &quot;proto-blues&quot; by [[Paul Oliver]], were made by Odum at the very beginning of the 20th century for research purposes. They are now utterly lost.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Cowley, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 265&lt;/ref&gt;  Other recordings that are still available were made in 1924 by [[Lawrence Gellert]]. Later, several recordings were made by [[Robert Winslow Gordon|Robert W. Gordon]], who became head of the [[Archive of Folk Culture|Archive of American Folk Songs]] of the [[Library of Congress]]. Gordon's successor at the Library was [[John Lomax]]. In the 1930s, together with his son [[Alan Lomax|Alan]], Lomax made a large number of non-commercial blues recordings that testify to the huge variety of proto-blues styles, such as [[field holler]]s and [[ring shout]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Cowley, in Nothing but the blues, pgs. 268-269&lt;/ref&gt;  A record of blues music as it existed before the 1920s is also given by the recordings of artists such as [[Lead Belly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The social and economic reasons for the appearance of the blues are not fully known.&lt;ref&gt;Philip V.

David Nicholls, 1999, [[Cambridge University Press]], ISBN 978-0-521-45429-2, pg. 285&lt;/ref&gt;  The first appearance of the blues is often dated after the [[Emancipation Proclamation|Emancipation Act of 1863]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kunzler, pg. 130&quot;/&gt; between 1870 and 1900, a period that coincides with [[Abolitionism|Emancipation]] and, later, the development of [[juke joint]]s as places where Blacks went to listen to music, dance, or gamble after a hard day's work.&lt;ref name=bluescommentary&gt;{{cite book| last = Oliver| first = Paul

Several scholars characterize the early 1900s development of blues music as a move from group performances to a more individualized style. They argue that the development of the blues is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the enslaved people. According to [[Lawrence Levine]], &quot;there was a direct relationship between the national ideological emphasis upon the individual, the popularity of [[Booker T. Washington]]'s teachings, and the rise of the blues.&quot; Levine states that &quot;psychologically, socially, and economically, African-Americans were being acculturated in a way that would have been impossible during slavery, and it is hardly surprising that their secular music reflected this as much as their religious music did.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence W. Levine, ''Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Folk Thought from Slavery to Freedom'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1977, ISBN 978-0-19-502374-9, pg. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few characteristics common to all blues music, because the genre took its shape from the idiosyncrasies of individual performances.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, pg. 333&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some characteristics that were present long before the creation of the modern blues. Call-and-response shouts were an early form of blues-like music; they were a &quot;functional expression ... style without accompaniment or harmony and unbounded by the formality of any particular musical structure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, pg. 44&lt;/ref&gt; A form of this pre-blues was heard in slave [[ring shout]]s and [[field holler]]s, expanded into &quot;simple solo songs laden with emotional content&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, pg. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Blues has evolved from the unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves imported from West Africa and rural blacks into a wide variety of styles and subgenres, with regional variations across the United States. Though blues, as it is now known, can be seen as a musical style based on both European [[harmony|harmonic structure]] and the African call-and-response tradition, transformed into an interplay of voice and guitar,&lt;ref&gt;Morales, pg. 276 Morales attributes this claim to [[John Storm Roberts]] in ''Black Music of Two Worlds'', beginning his discussion with a quote from Roberts: &quot;There does not seem to be the same African quality in blues forms as there clearly is in much Caribbean music.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Call and Response in Blues&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Call and Response in Blues  |publisher=How To Play Blues Guitar |accessdate=2008-08-11 |url=http://how-to-play-blues-guitar.com/blues-concepts/call-and-response/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the blues form itself bears no resemblance to the melodic styles of the West African [[griot]]s, and the influences are faint and tenuous.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Charters]], in Nothing But the Blues, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, no specific African musical form can be identified as the single direct ancestor of the blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

That blue notes pre-date their use in blues and have an African origin is attested by English composer [[Samuel Coleridge-Taylor]]'s &quot;A Negro Love Song&quot;, from his ''The African Suite for Piano'' composed in 1898, which contains [[minor third|blue third]] and [[seventh chord|seventh notes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Blues music also adopted elements from the &quot;Ethiopian airs&quot;, [[minstrel show]]s and [[Negro spiritual]]s, including instrumental and harmonic accompaniment.&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, pg. 44 ''Gradually, instrumental and harmonic accompaniment were added, reflecting increasing cross-cultural contact.''  Garofalo cites other authors that also mention the &quot;Ethiopian airs&quot; and &quot;Negro spirituals&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The style also was closely related to [[ragtime]], which developed at about the same time, though the blues better preserved &quot;the original melodic patterns of African music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schuller, cited in Garofalo, pg. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical forms and styles that are now considered the &quot;blues&quot; as well as modern &quot;[[country music]]&quot; arose in the same regions during the 19th century in the southern United States. Recorded blues and country can be found from as far back as the 1920s, when the popular record industry developed and created marketing categories called &quot;[[race music]]&quot; and &quot;[[hillbilly music]]&quot; to sell music by blacks for blacks and by whites for whites, respectively. At the time, there was no clear musical division between &quot;blues&quot; and &quot;country,&quot; except for the ethnicity of the performer, and even that was sometimes documented incorrectly by record companies.&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, pgs. 44–47 &quot;As marketing categories, designations like race and hillbilly intentionally separated artists along racial lines and conveyed the impression that their music came from mutually exclusive sources.  Nothing could have been further from the truth... In cultural terms, blues and country were more equal than they were separate.&quot; Garofalo claims that &quot;artists were sometimes listed in the wrong racial category in record company catalogues.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wolfe in Nothing but the Blues, pgs. 233-263&lt;/ref&gt;  Though musicologists can now attempt to define “the blues” narrowly in terms of certain chord structures and lyric strategies thought to have originated in West Africa, audiences originally heard the music in a far more general way: it was simply the music of the rural south, notably the Mississippi Delta. Black and white musicians shared the same repertoire and thought of themselves as “[[songsters]]” rather than “blues musicians.” The notion of blues as a separate genre arose during the black migration from the countryside to urban areas in the 1920s and the simultaneous development of the recording industry. “Blues” became a code word for a record designed to sell to black listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the blues are closely related to the religious music of the Afro-American community, the [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]]. The origins of spirituals go back much further than the blues, usually dating back to the middle of the 18th century, when the slaves were Christianized and began to sing and play Christian [[hymn]]s, in particular those of [[Isaac Watts]], which were very popular.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Humphrey in Nothing but the blues, pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the blues gained its formal definition in terms of chord progressions, it was defined as the secular counterpart of the spirituals. It was the low-down music played by the rural Blacks. Depending on the religious community a musician belonged to, it was more or less considered as a sin to play this low-down music: blues was the devil's music. Musicians were therefore segregated into two categories: gospel and blues singers, guitar preachers and songsters. However, at the time rural Black music began to get recorded in the 1920s, both categories of musicians used very similar techniques: call-and-response patterns, blue notes, and slide guitars. Gospel music was nevertheless using musical forms that were compatible with Christian hymns and therefore less marked by the blues form than its secular counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Humphrey in Nothing but the blues, pgs. 107-149&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-war blues===
The American [[sheet music]] publishing industry produced a great deal of [[ragtime]] music. By 1912, the sheet music industry had published three popular blues-like compositions, precipitating the [[Tin Pan Alley]] adoption of blues elements: &quot;Baby Seals' Blues&quot; by &quot;Baby&quot; F. Seals (arranged by [[Artie Matthews]]), &quot;Dallas Blues&quot; by [[Hart Wand]] and &quot;[[The Memphis Blues]]&quot; by [[W. C. Handy]].&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, pg. 27; Garofalo cites Barlow in &quot;Handy's sudden success demonstrated [the] commercial potential of [the blues], which in turn made the genre attractive to the Tin Pan Alley hacks, who wasted little time in turning out a deluge of imitations.&quot; (parentheticals in Garofalo)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Partitura.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sheet music from &quot;[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]&quot; (1914)]]

Handy was a formally trained musician, composer and arranger who helped to popularize the blues by transcribing and orchestrating blues in an almost symphonic style, with bands and singers. He became a popular and prolific composer, and billed himself as the &quot;Father of the Blues&quot;; however, his compositions can be described as a fusion of blues with ragtime and jazz, a merger facilitated using the Cuban [[habanera (music)|habanera]] rhythm that had long been a part of ragtime;&lt;ref name = &quot;cgkmik&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;trkeja&quot;&gt;Garofalo, pg. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Handy's signature work was the &quot;[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]&quot;.

In the 1920s, the blues became a major element of African American and American popular music, reaching white audiences via Handy's arrangements and the classic female blues performers. The blues evolved from informal performances in bars to entertainment in theaters. Blues performances were organized by the [[Theater Owners Bookers Association]] in [[nightclub]]s such as the [[Cotton Club]] and [[juke joint]]s such as the bars along [[Beale Street]] in Memphis. Several record companies, such as the [[American Record Corporation]], [[Okeh Records]], and [[Paramount Records]], began to record African American music.

As the recording industry grew, country blues performers like [[Bo Carter]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)]], [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]], [[Lonnie Johnson]], [[Tampa Red]] and [[Blind Blake]] became more popular in the African American community. Kentucky-born [[Sylvester Weaver]] was in 1923 the first to record the [[slide guitar]] style, in which a guitar is fretted with a knife blade or the sawed-off neck of a bottle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slide guitar became an important part of the [[Delta blues]].&lt;ref name = &quot;bkihns&quot;&gt;Clarke, pg. 138&lt;/ref&gt;  The first blues recordings from the 1920s are categorized as a traditional, rural [[country blues]] and a more polished 'city' or urban blues.

Country blues performers often improvised, either without accompaniment or with only a banjo or guitar. Regional styles of country blues varied widely in the early 20th century. The (Mississippi) Delta blues was a rootsy sparse style with passionate vocals accompanied by slide guitar. The little-recorded [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, pg. 141&lt;/ref&gt; combined elements of urban and rural blues. In addition to Robert Johnson, influential performers of this style included his predecessors [[Charley Patton]] and [[Son House]]. Singers such as [[Blind Willie McTell]] and [[Blind Boy Fuller]] performed in the southeastern &quot;delicate and lyrical&quot; [[Piedmont blues]] tradition, which used an elaborate ragtime-based [[fingerpicking]] guitar technique. Georgia also had an early slide tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, pg. 139&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Curley Weaver]], [[Tampa Red]], [[Barbecue Bob|&quot;Barbecue Bob&quot; Hicks]] and [[Kokomo Arnold|James &quot;Kokomo&quot; Arnold]] as representatives of this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite album-notes

The lively [[Memphis blues]] style, which developed in the 1920s and 1930s near [[Memphis, Tennessee]], was influenced by [[jug band]]s such as the [[Memphis Jug Band]] or the [[Gus Cannon|Gus Cannon's Jug Stompers]]. Performers such as [[Frank Stokes (musician)|Frank Stokes]], [[Sleepy John Estes]], [[Robert Wilkins]], [[Joe McCoy]], [[Casey Bill Weldon]] and [[Memphis Minnie]] used a variety of unusual instruments such as [[washboard]], [[Musical styles (violin)#Fiddle|fiddle]], [[kazoo]] or [[mandolin]]. Memphis Minnie was famous for her [[virtuoso]] guitar style. Pianist [[Memphis Slim]] began his career in Memphis, but his distinct style was smoother and had some swing elements. Many blues musicians based in Memphis moved to Chicago in the late 1930s or early 1940s and became part of the urban blues movement, which blended country music and electric blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A well-known big band blues tune is [[Glenn Miller]]'s &quot;[[In the Mood]]&quot;. In the 1940s, the [[jump blues]] style developed. Jump blues grew up from the boogie woogie wave and was strongly influenced by [[big band]] music. It uses [[saxophone]] or other [[brass instrument]]s and the guitar in the rhythm section to create a jazzy, up-tempo sound with declamatory vocals. Jump blues tunes by [[Louis Jordan]] and [[Big Joe Turner]], based in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], influenced the development of later styles such as [[rock and roll]] and [[rhythm and blues]].&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, pg. 76&lt;/ref&gt;  Dallas-born [[T-Bone Walker]], who is often associated with the [[West Coast blues|California blues]] style,&lt;ref&gt;Komara, pg. 120&lt;/ref&gt; performed a successful transition from the early urban blues à la [[Lonnie Johnson]] and [[Leroy Carr]] to the jump blues style and dominated the [[jazz blues|blues-jazz]] scene at [[Los Angeles]] during the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Humphrey, in Nothing but the blues, pgs. 175-177&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s===
The transition from country to urban blues, that began in the 1920s, had always been driven by the successive waves of economic crisis and booms and the associated move of the rural Blacks to urban areas, the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. The [[post-World War II boom|long boom]] in the aftermath of World War II induced a massive migration of the African American population, the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]], which was accompanied by a significant increase of the real income of the urban Blacks. The new migrants constituted a new market for the music industry. The name [[race record]] disappeared and was succeeded by [[Rhythm and Blues]]. This rapidly evolving market was mirrored by the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[List of number-one rhythm and blues hits (United States)|Rhythm and Blues Chart]]. This marketing strategy reinforced trends within urban blues music such as the progressive electrification of the instruments, their amplification and the generalization of the blues beat, the blues shuffle, that became ubiquitous in R&amp;B. This commercial stream had important consequences for blues music which, together with Jazz and Gospel music, became a component of the R&amp;B wave.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Pearson in Nothing but the blues, pgs. 313-314&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Little Walter]] and [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson (Rice Miller)]] are well known harmonica (called &quot;[[Harmonica techniques#Blues harp (2nd position)|harp]]&quot; by blues musicians) players of the early Chicago blues scene. Other harp players such as [[Big Walter Horton]] were also influential. Muddy Waters and Elmore James were known for their innovative use of slide electric guitar. Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters were known for their deep, &quot;gravelly&quot; voices.

Bassist and composer [[Willie Dixon]] played a major role on the Chicago blues scene. He composed and wrote many [[blues standard|standard blues]] songs of the period, such as &quot;[[Hoochie Coochie Man]]&quot;, &quot;[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]&quot; (both penned for Muddy Waters) and, &quot;[[Wang Dang Doodle]]&quot; and &quot;[[Back Door Man]]&quot; for Howlin' Wolf. Most artists of the Chicago blues style recorded for the Chicago-based [[Chess Records]] and [[Checker Records]] labels. Smaller blues labels of this era included [[Vee-Jay Records]] and [[J.O.B. Records]]. During the early 1950s, the dominating Chicago labels were challenged by [[Sam Phillips]]' [[Sun Records]] company in Memphis, which recorded [[B. B. King]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]] before he moved to Chicago in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Humphrey, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 187&lt;/ref&gt; After Phillips discovered [[Elvis Presley]] in 1954, the Sun label turned to the rapidly expanding white audience and started recording mostly rock 'n' roll.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Pearson, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, blues had a huge influence on mainstream American popular music. While popular musicians like [[Bo Diddley]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Herzhaft, pg. 53&quot;/&gt; and [[Chuck Berry]],&lt;ref&gt;Herzhaft, pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; both recording for Chess, were influenced by the Chicago blues, their enthusiastic playing styles departed from the melancholy aspects of blues. Chicago blues also influenced [[Louisiana]]'s [[zydeco]] music,&lt;ref&gt;Herzhaft, pg. 236&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Clifton Chenier]]&lt;ref&gt;Herzhaft, pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt; using blues accents. Zydeco musicians used electric solo guitar and [[cajun]] arrangements of blues standards.

Overseas, in England, electric blues took root there during a much acclaimed Muddy Waters tour. Waters, unsuspecting of his audience's tendency towards [[skiffle]], an acoustic, softer brand of blues, turned up his amp and started to play his Chicago brand of electric blues. Although the audience was largely jolted by the performance, the performance influenced local musicians such as [[Alexis Korner]] and [[Cyril Davies]] to emulate this louder style, inspiring the [[British invasion]] of the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer (1981), pgs. 257-259&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s, a new blues style emerged on Chicago's [[Neighborhoods of Chicago|West Side]] pioneered by [[Magic Sam]], [[Buddy Guy]] and [[Otis Rush]] on [[Cobra Records]].&lt;ref&gt;Koroma, pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The 'West Side Sound' had strong rhythmic support from a rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums and as pefected by Guy, [[Freddie King]], [[Magic Slim]] and [[Luther Allison]] was dominated by amplified electric lead guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other blues artists, such as [[John Lee Hooker]] had influences not directly related to the Chicago style. John Lee Hooker's blues is more &quot;personal&quot;, based on Hooker's deep rough voice accompanied by a single electric guitar. Though not directly influenced by boogie woogie, his &quot;groovy&quot; style is sometimes called &quot;guitar boogie&quot;. His first hit, &quot;[[Boogie Chillen]]&quot;, reached #1 on the R&amp;B charts in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Bjorn, ''Before Motown'', 2001, [[University of Michigan]] Press, ISBN 978-0-472-06765-7, pg. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1950s, the [[swamp blues]] genre developed near [[Baton Rouge]], with performers such as [[Lightnin' Slim]],&lt;ref&gt;Herzhaft, pg 116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slim Harpo]],&lt;ref&gt;Herzhaft, pg. 188&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Myers]] and [[Jerry McCain]] around the producer [[J. D. &quot;Jay&quot; Miller]] and the [[Excello Records|Excello]] label. Strongly influenced by [[Jimmy Reed]], Swamp blues has a slower pace and a simpler use of the harmonica than the Chicago blues style performers such as Little Walter or Muddy Waters. Songs from this genre include &quot;Scratch my Back&quot;, &quot;She's Tough&quot; and &quot;[[I'm a King Bee]]&quot;.

===1960s and 1970s===
By the beginning of the 1960s, genres influenced by [[African American music]] such as [[rock and roll]] and [[soul music|soul]] were part of mainstream popular music. White performers had brought African-American music to new audiences, both within the US and abroad. However, the blues wave that brought artists such as Muddy Waters to the foreground had stopped. Bluesmen such as [[Big Bill Broonzy]] and [[Willie Dixon]] started looking for new markets in Europe. [[Dick Waterman]] and the blues festivals he organized in Europe played a major role in propagating blues music abroad. In the UK, bands emulated US blues legends, and UK blues-rock-based bands had an influential role throughout the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Jim O'Neal in Nothing but the blues, pgs 347-387&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B. B. King.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Blues legend [[B.B. King]] with his guitar, &quot;Lucille&quot;.]]
Blues performers such as [[John Lee Hooker]] and [[Muddy Waters]] continued to perform to enthusiastic audiences, inspiring new artists steeped in traditional blues, such as New York–born [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]]. [[John Lee Hooker]] blended his blues style with rock elements and playing with younger white musicians, creating a musical style that can be heard on the 1971 album ''Endless Boogie''. [[B. B. King]]'s virtuoso guitar technique earned him the eponymous title &quot;king of the blues&quot;. In contrast to the Chicago style, King's band used strong brass support from a saxophone, trumpet, and trombone, instead of using slide guitar or harp. [[Tennessee]]-born [[Bobby Bland|Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland]], like B. B. King, also straddled the blues and R&amp;B genres. During this period, Freddie King and Albert King often played with rock and soul musicians (Eric Clapton, [[Booker T &amp; the MGs]]) and had a major influence on those styles of music.

The music of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Koroma, pg. 122&quot;&gt;Koroma, pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Free Speech Movement|Free Speech]] movements in the US prompted a [[American folk music revival|resurgence of interest in American roots music and early African American music]]. As well as Jimmi Bass Music festivals such as the [[Newport Folk Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;Koroma, pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; brought traditional blues to a new audience, which helped to revive interest in prewar acoustic blues and performers such as [[Son House]], [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[Skip James]], and [[Reverend Gary Davis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Koroma, pg. 122&quot;/&gt; Many compilations of classic prewar blues were republished by the [[Yazoo Records]]. [[J. B. Lenoir]] from the Chicago blues movement in the 1950s recorded several LPs using acoustic guitar, sometimes accompanied by [[Willie Dixon]] on the acoustic bass or drums. His songs, originally distributed in Europe only,&lt;ref&gt;Jim O'Neal, in Nothing but the blues, pg. 380&lt;/ref&gt; commented on political issues such as [[racism]] or [[Vietnam War]] issues, which was unusual for this period. His ''Alabama Blues'' recording had a song that stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I never will go back to Alabama, that is not the place for me (2x)&lt;br /&gt;
You know they killed my sister and my brother,&lt;br /&gt;
and the whole world let them peoples go down there free
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

White audiences' interest in the blues during the 1960s increased due to the Chicago-based [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band]] and the [[British blues]] movement. The style of British blues developed in the UK, when bands such as [[The Animals]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Yardbirds]], and [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and Irish musician [[Rory Gallagher]] performed classic blues songs from the [[Delta blues|Delta]] or [[Chicago blues]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=A Short Blues History
|work=History of Rock
|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s earlier hits were renditions of traditional blues songs.

The British and blues musicians of the early 1960s inspired a number of American [[blues rock]] fusion performers, including [[Canned Heat]], the early [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Johnny Winter]], [[The J. Geils Band]], [[Ry Cooder]], and The [[Allman Brothers Band]]. One [[blues rock]] performer, [[Jimi Hendrix]], was a rarity in his field at the time: a black man who played [[psychedelic rock]]. Hendrix was a skilled guitarist, and a pioneer in the innovative use of [[distortion]] and [[feedback]] in his music.&lt;ref&gt;Garofalo, pgs. 224–225&lt;/ref&gt; Through these artists and others, blues music influenced the development of [[rock music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Santana (band)|Santana]], which was originally called the ''Carlos Santana Blues Band'', also experimented with [[Latin music|Latin]]-influenced blues and blues-rock music around this time. At the end of the 1950s appeared the very bluesy [[The Tulsa Sound|Tulsa Sound]] merging rock'n'roll, jazz and country influences. This particular music style started to be broadly popularized within the 1970s by [[J.J. Cale]] and the cover versions performed by [[Eric Clapton]] of &quot;[[After Midnight]]&quot; and &quot;[[Cocaine (song)|Cocaine]]&quot;.

In the early 1970s, The [[Texas blues|Texas rock-blues style]] emerged, which used guitars in both solo and rhythm roles. In contrast with the West Side blues, the Texas style is strongly influenced by the British rock-blues movement. Major artists of the Texas style are [[Johnny Winter]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]], and [[ZZ Top]]. These artists all began their musical journey in the 1970s, but they did not achieve major international success until the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;Koroma, pg. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s to the 2000s===
Since the 1980s, there has been a resurgence of interest in the blues among a certain part of the African-American population, particularly around [[Jackson, Mississippi]] and other [[deep South]] regions. Often termed &quot;[[soul blues]]&quot; or &quot;[[Southern soul]]&quot;, the music at the heart of this movement was given new life by the unexpected success of two particular recordings on the Jackson-based [[Malaco Records|Malaco]] label:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Contemporary African-American performers who work this vein of the blues include [[Bobby Rush (musician)|Bobby Rush]], [[Denise LaSalle]], [[Sir Charles Jones]], [[Bettye LaVette]], [[Marvin Sease]] and [[Peggy Scott-Adams]].

[[File:Svaughan.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Texas blues guitarist [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]]]
During the 1980s, blues also continued in both traditional and new forms. In 1986, the album ''[[Strong Persuader]]'' revealed [[Robert Cray]] as a major blues artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] recording, ''[[Texas Flood]]'', was released in 1983, and the Texas-based guitarist exploded onto the international stage. 1989 saw a revival of [[John Lee Hooker]]'s popularity with the album ''[[The Healer (album)|The Healer]]''. [[Eric Clapton]], known for his performances with [[John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers|the Blues Breakers]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]], made a comeback in the 1990s with his album ''[[Unplugged (Eric Clapton album)|Unplugged]]'', in which he played some standard blues numbers on acoustic guitar. However, beginning in the 1990s, [[digital recording|digital multitrack recording]] and other technological advances and new marketing strategies that include [[video clip]] production have increased costs, and challenge the spontaneity and improvisation that are an important component of blues music.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Katherine Aldin, in ''Nothing but the blues'', pg. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, blues publications such as ''[[Living Blues]]'' and ''Blues Revue'' began to be distributed, major cities began forming blues societies, outdoor blues festivals became more common, and&lt;ref&gt;A directory of the most significant blues festivals can be found at {{cite web |url=http://blues.about.com/od/bluesfestivals/ |title=Blues - By Category |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate= 15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; more [[nightclub]]s and venues for blues emerged.&lt;ref&gt;A list of important blues venues in the U.S. can be found at {{cite web |url=http://blues.about.com/cs/venues/ |title=About.com |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, blues performers explored a range of musical genres, as can be seen, for example, from the broad array of nominees of the yearly [[Blues Music Awards]], previously named W. C. Handy Awards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Blues Music Awards information | url=http://www.blues.org/bluesmusicawards/  |accessdate=November 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or of the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album|Grammy Awards for Best Contemporary]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album|Traditional Blues Album]]. The [[List of number-one blues albums|Bilboard Blues Album chart]] monitors and therefore provides an overview over the current blues production. Contemporary blues music is nurtured by several blues labels such as: [[Alligator Records]], [[Ruf Records]], [[Severn Records]], [[Chess Records]] ([[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]), [[Delmark Records]], [[NorthernBlues Music]], and [[Vanguard Records]] ([[Artemis Records]]). Some labels are famous for their rediscovering and remastering of blues rarities such as [[Arhoolie Records]], [[Smithsonian Folkways Recordings]] (heir of [[Folkways Records]]) and [[Yazoo Records]] ([[Shanachie Records]]).&lt;ref&gt;A complete directory of contemporary blues labels can be found at {{cite web |url=http://blues.about.com/cs/recordlabels |title=About.com |accessdate=15 October 2010}}/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical impact==

Blues musical styles, forms (12-bar blues), melodies, and the blues scale have influenced many other genres of music, such as rock and roll, jazz, and popular music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-08-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent jazz, folk or rock performers, such as [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Miles Davis]], and [[Bob Dylan]] have performed significant blues recordings. The blues scale is often used in [[popular song]]s like [[Harold Arlen]]'s &quot;Blues in the Night&quot;, [[blues ballad]]s like &quot;Since I Fell for You&quot; and &quot;Please Send Me Someone to Love&quot;, and even in orchestral works such as [[George Gershwin]]'s &quot;[[Rhapsody in Blue]]&quot; and &quot;Concerto in F&quot;. Gershwin's second &quot;Prelude&quot; for solo piano is an interesting example of a classical blues, maintaining the form with academic strictness. The blues scale is ubiquitous in modern popular music and informs many [[modal frame (music)|modal frames]], especially the [[ladder of thirds]] used in rock music (for example,, in &quot;[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]&quot;). Blues forms are used in the theme to the televised ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', [[teen idol]] [[Fabian (entertainer)|Fabian's]] hit, &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot;, [[country music]] star [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]' music, and guitarist/vocalist [[Tracy Chapman]]'s hit &quot;Give Me One Reason&quot;.

[[R&amp;B]] music can be traced back to [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]] and blues. Musically, spirituals were a descendant of [[New England]] choral traditions, and in particular of [[Isaac Watts]]'s [[hymn]]s, mixed with African rhythms and call-and-response forms. Spirituals or religious chants in the African-American community are much better documented than the &quot;low-down&quot; blues. Spiritual singing developed because African-American communities could gather for mass or worship gatherings, which were called [[camp meeting]]s.

Early country bluesmen such as [[Skip James]], [[Charley Patton]], [[Georgia Tom Dorsey]] played country and urban blues and had influences from spiritual singing. Dorsey helped to popularize [[Gospel music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gospel music developed in the 1930s, with the [[Golden Gate Quartet]]. In the 1950s, [[soul music]] by [[Sam Cooke]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[James Brown]] used gospel and blues music elements. In the 1960s and 1970s, gospel and blues were these merged in [[soul blues]] music. [[Funk]] music of the 1970s was influenced by soul; funk can be seen as an antecedent of hip-hop and contemporary R&amp;B.

Before [[World War II]], the boundaries between blues and [[jazz]] were less clear. Usually jazz had harmonic structures stemming from [[brass band]]s, whereas blues had blues forms such as the 12-bar blues. However, the jump blues of the 1940s mixed both styles. After WWII, blues had a substantial influence on jazz. [[Bebop]] classics, such as [[Charlie Parker]]'s &quot;Now's the Time&quot;, used the blues form with the pentatonic scale and blue notes.
Bebop marked a major shift in the role of jazz, from a popular style of music for dancing, to a &quot;high-art,&quot; less-accessible, cerebral &quot;musician's music&quot;. The audience for both blues and jazz split, and the border between blues and jazz became more defined. Artists straddling the boundary between jazz and blues are categorized into the [[jazz blues]] sub-genre.&lt;ref name=monk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The blues' 12-bar structure and the blues scale was a major influence on [[rock and roll]] music. Rock and roll has been called &quot;blues with a [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]]&quot;; [[Carl Perkins]] called [[rockabilly]] &quot;blues with a [[country music|country]] beat&quot;. Rockabillies were also said to be 12-bar blues played with a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] beat. &quot;[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]&quot;, with its unmodified 12-bar structure (in both harmony and lyrics) and a melody centered on flatted third of the tonic (and flatted seventh of the subdominant), is a blues song transformed into a rock and roll song. [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]'s style of rock and roll was heavily influenced by the blues and its derivative boogie woogie. His style of music was not exactly rockabilly but it has been often called real rock and roll (this is a label he shares with several African American rock and roll performers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A lot of the 1970s-era &quot;outlaw&quot; country music by [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Waylon Jennings]] also borrowed from the blues. When [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] returned to country after the decline of 1950s style rock and roll, he sang his country with a blues feel and often included blues standards on his albums. Many early rock and roll songs are based on blues:  &quot;[[That's All Right Mama]]&quot;, &quot;[[Johnny B. Goode]]&quot;, &quot;[[Blue Suede Shoes]]&quot;, &quot;[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On]]&quot;, &quot;[[Shake, Rattle, and Roll]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Long Tall Sally]]&quot;. The early African American rock musicians retained the sexual themes and innuendos of blues music: &quot;Got a gal named Sue, knows just what to do&quot; (&quot;[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]&quot;, [[Little Richard]]) or &quot;See the girl with the red dress on, She can do the Birdland all night long&quot; (&quot;[[What'd I Say (song)|What'd I Say]]&quot;, [[Ray Charles]]). The 12-bar blues structure can be found even in novelty pop songs, such as [[Bob Dylan]]'s &quot;[[Obviously Five Believers]]&quot; and [[Esther and Abi Ofarim]]'s &quot;[[Cinderella Rockefella]]&quot;.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Tajmahalblues.jpg|thumb|right|175 px|The music of [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] for the 1972 movie ''[[Sounder]]'' marked a revival of interest in acoustic blues.]]
Like [[jazz]], [[rock and roll]], [[heavy metal music]], [[hip hop music]], [[reggae]], [[country music]], and [[pop music]], blues has been accused of being the &quot;[[Satan|devil]]'s music&quot; and of inciting violence and other poor behavior.&lt;ref&gt;SFGate&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the blues was considered disreputable, especially as white audiences began listening to the blues during the 1920s.&lt;ref name = &quot;trkeja&quot;/&gt; In the early twentieth century, [[W. C. Handy|W.C. Handy]] was the first to popularize blues-influenced music among non-black Americans.

During the blues revival of the 1960s and '70s, acoustic blues artist [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and legendary Texas bluesman [[Lightnin' Hopkins]] wrote and performed music that figured prominently in the popularly and critically acclaimed film ''[[Sounder (film)|Sounder]]'' (1972). The film earned Mahal a [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture and a [[BAFTA]] nomination.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sounder&quot;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069303/awards|The Internet Movie Database]. Retrieved 11-02-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 30&amp;nbsp;years later, Mahal wrote blues for, and performed a banjo composition, claw-hammer style, in the 2001 movie release &quot;[[Songcatcher]]&quot;, which focused on the story of the preservation of the [[Appalachian music|roots music of Appalachia]].

Perhaps the most visible example of the blues style of music in the late 20th century came in 1980, when [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Landis]] released the film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''. The film drew many of the biggest living influenciers of the [[Rhythm and blues]] genre together, such as [[Ray Charles]], [[James Brown]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Aretha Franklin]], and [[John Lee Hooker]]. The band formed also began a successful tour under the [[The Blues Brothers|Blues Brothers]] marquee. 1998 brought a sequel, ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' that, while not holding as great a critical and financial success, featured a much larger number of blues artists, such as [[B.B. King]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Charlie Musselwhite]], [[Blues Traveller]], [[Jimmy Vaughn]], [[Jeff Baxter]].

In 2003, [[Martin Scorsese]] made significant efforts to promote the blues to a larger audience. He asked several famous directors such as [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Wim Wenders]] to participate in a series of documentary films for [[PBS]] called ''[[The Blues (film)|The Blues]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title | title=&quot;The Blues&quot; (2003) (mini) | id = 0287198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated in the rendition of compilations of major blues artists in a series of high-quality CDs. Blues guitarist and vocalist [[Keb' Mo']] performed his blues rendition of &quot;[[America, the Beautiful]]&quot; in 2006 to close out the final season of the television series ''[[The West Wing]]''.

==History==
{{Main|History of Berlin}}

The name ''Berlin'' is of unknown origin, but may originate from the area's former [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants, and be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' &quot;swamp&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=3411062525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ZLB-Berliner Ansichten-Januar.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Berlin in 1688]]

The earliest evidence of settlements in today's Berlin central areas is a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192.&lt;ref name = &quot;zycwaq&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|work=Associated Press|title=Berlin dig finds city older than thought|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first written mention of towns in the area of present-day Berlin dates from the late 12th century. [[Spandau]] is first mentioned in 1197, and [[Köpenick]] in 1209, though these areas did not join Berlin until 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/tourismus/sehenswuerdigkeiten.en/00175.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080612020333/http://www.berlin.de/tourismus/sehenswuerdigkeiten.en/00175.html|archivedate=2008-06-12|title=Spandau Citadel|work=Berlin tourist board|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. [[Cölln]] on the [[Fischerinsel]] is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the [[Spree]] in what is now called the [[Nikolaiviertel]], is referenced in a document from 1244.&lt;ref name = &quot;zycwaq&quot;/&gt; The former is considered to be the &quot;founding date&quot;. From the beginning, the two cities formed an economic and social unit. In 1307, the two cities were united politically. Over time, the twin cities came to be known simply as Berlin.

In 1435, [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick I]] became the [[prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which he ruled until 1440.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html|title=The Hohenzollern Dynasty|work=Antipas|accessdate=18 August 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070807093738/http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html |archivedate = August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II Irontooth]], established Berlin as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the [[Hohenzollern]] family ruled until 1918 in Berlin, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and finally as [[German emperor]]s. In 1448 citizens rebelled in the &quot;Berlin Indignation&quot; against the construction of a new royal palace by Frederick II Irontooth. This protest was not successful, however, and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. In 1451 Berlin became the royal residence of the Brandenburg electors, and Berlin had to give up its status as a free [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became [[Lutheran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smp-protein.de/SMPConference/berlin.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060818100934/http://www.smp-protein.de/SMPConference/berlin.htm|archivedate=18 August 2006|title=Berlin Cathedral|work=SMPProtein|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th to 19th centuries===
[[File:Friedrich Zweite Alt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frederick the Great]] (1712–1786) was one of Europe's [[enlightened monarch]]s.]]

The [[Thirty Years' War]] between 1618 and 1648 had devastating consequences for Berlin. A third of the houses were damaged and the city lost half of its population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/germany/bra30.html|title=Brandenburg during the 30 Years War|work=WHKMLA|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], known as the &quot;Great Elector&quot;, who had succeeded his father [[George William, Elector of Brandenburg|George William]] as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance. With the [[Edict of Potsdam]] in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French [[Huguenot]]s. More than 15,000 Huguenots went to Brandenburg, of whom 6,000 settled in Berlin. By 1700, approximately 20 percent of Berlin's residents were French, and their cultural influence on the city was immense. Many other immigrants came from [[Bohemia]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], and [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]].

[[File:Berlin Unter den Linden Victoria Hotel um 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin became the capital of the German Empire in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years. (Unter den Linden in 1900)]]

With the coronation of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]] in 1701 as king (in [[Königsberg]]), Berlin became the new capital of the Kingdom of Prussia (instead of Königsberg); this was a successful attempt to centralize the capital in the very outspread Prussian Kingdom, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1740 Frederick II, known as [[Frederick the Great]] (1740–1786), came to power. Berlin became, under the rule of the philosophically oriented Frederick II, a center of [[the Enlightenment]]. Following [[First French Empire|France's]] victory in the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] marched into Berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city. In 1815 the city became part of the new [[Province of Brandenburg]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main rail hub and economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, outlying suburbs including [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], [[Moabit]], and several others were incorporated into Berlin. In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded German Empire. On 1 April 1881 it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.

===20th century===
[[File:Potsdamer Platz 1945.jpg|thumb|Berlin in ruins after [[World War II]] (Potsdamer Platz, 1945).]]

At the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, a [[Weimar Republic|republic]] was proclaimed in Berlin. In 1920, the [[Greater Berlin Act]] incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. This new area encompassed Spandau and [[Charlottenburg]] in the west, as well as several other areas that are now major municipalities. After this expansion, Berlin had a population of around four million. During the Weimar era, Berlin became internationally renowned as a center of cultural transformation, at the heart of the [[Roaring Twenties]].

On 30 January 1933 ([[Machtergreifung]]), [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] came to power. Nazi rule destroyed Berlin's Jewish community, which had numbered 170,000 before 1933. After the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom in 1938, thousands of the city's German Jews were imprisoned in the nearby [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] or, in early 1943, were shipped to [[death camp]]s, such as [[Auschwitz]]. During the Second World War, large parts of Berlin were destroyed in [[Battle of Berlin (air)|the 1943–45 air raids]] and during the [[Battle of Berlin]]. Among the hundreds of thousands who died during the Battle for Berlin, an estimated 125,000 were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Clodfelter|first=Michael|title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts- A Statistical Reference to Casualty and Other Figures, 1500-2000|edition=2nd|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2002|isbn=0786412046}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[end of World War II in Europe|end of the war in Europe]] in 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]] into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the Western Allies (the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]) formed [[West Berlin]], while the [[Soviet Union|Soviet sector]] formed [[East Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t297c01.html|title=Agreement to divide Berlin|work=FDR-Library|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlinermauer.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Berlin Wall]] in 1986, painted on the western side. People crossing the so-called &quot;death strip&quot; on the eastern side were at risk of being shot.]]

All four allies retained shared responsibility for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the [[Soviet Union]] imposed a [[Berlin Blockade|blockade]] on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet controlled territory. The allies successfully overcame the blockade by the [[Berlin airlift]], which flew in food and other supplies to the city from 24 June 1948 to 11 May 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|title=Berlin Airlift / Blockade|work=Western Allies Berlin|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in [[West Germany]], and eventually included all of the American, British, and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but for all practical purposes, it was assimilated to the Federal Republic of Germany without actually being a part of it. West Berlin issued its own postage stamps which were often the same as West German postage stamps but with the additional word 'Berlin' added. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British, and French airlines.

[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.]]

The founding of the two German states increased [[Cold War]] tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory. East Germany, however, proclaimed East Berlin (which it described only as &quot;Berlin&quot;) as its capital, a move that was not recognized by the Western powers. Although half the size and population of West Berlin, it included most of the historic center of the city. The West German government, meanwhile, established itself provisionally in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/1945.en.html|title=Berlin official website; History after 1945|work=City of Berlin|accessdate=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tensions between east and west culminated in the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] between East and West Berlin and other barriers around West Berlin by East Germany on 13 August 1961 and were exacerbated by a tank standoff at [[Checkpoint Charlie]] on 27 October 1961. West Berlin was now [[de facto]] a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany.

Berlin was completely divided. It was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other only through strictly controlled checkpoints. For most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was no longer possible. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power agreement]] guaranteed access across East Germany to West Berlin and ended the potential for harassment or closure of the routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga5-710903.htm|title=Ostpolitik: The Quadripartite Agreement of September 3, 1971|work=US Berlin Embassy|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, pressure from the East German population broke free across the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989, which was subsequently mostly demolished. Not much is left of it today; the [[East Side Gallery]] in [[Friedrichshain]] near the ''Oberbaumbrücke'' over the [[Spree]] preserves a portion of the Wall. Democracy and market economy changed East Germany and East Berlin.

On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin became the German capital according to the unification treaty. In June 1991, the German Parliament, the [[Bundestag]], voted to move the (West) German capital back from Bonn to Berlin. Thus, the German parliament and government began their work in Berlin in 1999.

==Geography==
[[File:Berlin.svg|thumb|Natural and built environment.]]

Berlin is located in eastern Germany, about {{convert|70|km|sp=us}} west of the border with [[Poland]] in an area with marshy terrain, and is surrounded by the [[States of Germany|federal state]] of [[Brandenburg]]. The Berlin–Warsaw ''Urstromtal'' (ice age melt water flow), between the low Barnim plateau to the north and the Teltow plateau to the south, was formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last ice age. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, Berlin's westernmost borough, the Spree meets the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and [[Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&amp;spn=0.060339,0.085316&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en|title=Satellite Image Berlin|work=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Über den Dächern von Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|View over central Berlin. [[Unter den Linden]] in foreground and skyscrapers of [[Potsdamer Platz]] up to the right.]]

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim plateau, while most of the boroughs [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow plateau.

The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin ''Urstromtal'' and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. The highest elevations in Berlin are the [[Teufelsberg]] and the [[Müggelberge]]. Both hills have an elevation of about {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The Teufelsberg is in fact an artificial pile of rubble from the ruins of World War II.

===Climate===
[[File:Potsdam view from above.jpg|thumb|The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes]]
Berlin has a [[humid continental climate]] according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system. The city features a [[temperate climate]].

Summers are warm with average high temperatures of {{convert|22|-|25|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|12|-|14|C|F}}. Winters are cold with average high temperatures of {{convert|4|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|-2|to|0|C|F}}. Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with heat stored by the city's buildings. Temperatures can be {{convert|4|C-change|sigfig=1}} higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;www.weather.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual precipitation is {{convert|570|mm|in|sp=us}} with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through March, but snow cover does not usually remain for long. The recent winter of 2009/2010 was an exception as there was a permanent snow cover from late December till early March.&lt;ref name=worldweather&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweather.org/016/c00059.htm|title=Climate figures|work=World Weather Information Service|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cityscape===
[[File:Berlin night.jpg|thumb|Berlin along the Spree river and the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] by night]]

Berlin's history has left the city with a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin​—​the 1871 German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany​—​initiated ambitious (re-)construction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture. Berlin was devastated by bombing raids during World War II, and many of the buildings that had remained after the war were demolished in the 1950s and 1960s in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads.

The eastern parts of Berlin have many ''[[Plattenbau]]ten'', reminders of [[Eastern Bloc]] ambitions to create complete residential areas that had fixed ratios of shops, kindergartens and schools to the number of inhabitants.

===Architecture===
[[File:Berlin - Haus des Lehrers &amp; BCC.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Haus des Lehrers&quot; and Congress Hall at Alexanderplatz.]]

The [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{m to ft|368|precision=0}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] Style of the [[Joseph Stalin]] era. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. The previously built-up part in front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological scene.

[[File:2005-10-26 Brandenburger-Tor.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Brandenburg Gate]].]]
The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division. It has recently undergone a restoration.

The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany. It also appears on German [[euro]] coins (10&amp;nbsp;cent, 20&amp;nbsp;cent, and 50&amp;nbsp;cent). The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament, renovated in the 1950s after severe World War II damage. The building was again remodeled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

[[File:PotsdamerplatzBerlin.JPG|thumb|right|[[Potsdamer Platz]] at dusk.]]
The [[Gendarmenmarkt]], a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin whose name dates back to the Napoleonic occupation of the city, is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the German Cathedral. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

The [[Berlin Cathedral]], a Protestant cathedral and the third church on this site, is located on the [[Museum Island|Spree Island]] across from the site of the [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschloss]] and adjacent to the [[Lustgarten]]. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. Like many other buildings, it suffered extensive damage during the Second World War. [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]] is Berlin's [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral.

[[Unter den Linden]] is a tree lined east-west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street and part of [[Humboldt University]] is located there. [[Friedrichstraße]] was Berlin's legendary street during the [[Roaring Twenties]]. It combines 20th century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

[[Potsdamer Platz]] is an entire quarter built from scratch after 1995 after the Wall came down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html|title=Construction and redevelopment since 1990|work=Senate Department of Urban Development|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]], and is flanked by the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Berliner Philharmonie]]. The [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], a [[Holocaust]] memorial, is situated to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/arts/design/09holo.html?ex=1162962000&amp;en=272335914d8b80d6&amp;ei=5070|title=A Forest of Pillars, Recalling the Unimaginable|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=18 August 2008|first=Nicolai|last=Ouroussoff|date=9 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area around Hackescher Markt is home to the fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the [[Hackesche Höfe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. [[Oranienburger Straße]] and the nearby [[New Synagogue (Berlin)|New Synagogue]] were the center of Jewish culture before 1933.  Although the New Synagogue is still an anchor for Jewish history and culture, Oranienburger straße and surrounding areas are increasingly known for the shopping and nightlife.

[[File:Schloss Charlottenburg 2005 282.JPG|thumb|[[Schloss Charlottenburg]] is the largest existing palace in Berlin.]]

The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as central East-West-Axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately half-way from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous &quot;[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!&quot; speech, is situated in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].

West of the center, [[Schloss Bellevue]] is the residence of the German President. [[Schloss Charlottenburg]], which was burnt out in the Second World War and largely destroyed, has been rebuilt and is the largest surviving historical palace in Berlin.

The [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower at the fair area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators, and has a restaurant {{m to ft|55|precision=0|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{m to ft|126|precision=0|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

==Politics==
[[File:Reichstag building Berlin view from west before sunset.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] is the site of the German parliament.]]

Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany and is the seat of the [[President of Germany]], whose official residence is [[Schloss Bellevue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundespraesident.de/en Bundespräsident Horst Köhler], www.bundespraesident.de. Retrieved 12 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Since German reunification on 3 October 1990, it has been one of the three city states, together with [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], among the present 16 states of Germany.

The [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] (&quot;federal council&quot;) is the representation of the Federal States (''Bundesländer'') of Germany and has its seat at the former [[Prussian House of Lords]]. Though most of the ministries are seated in Berlin, some of them, as well as some minor departments, are seated in [[Bonn]], the former capital of West Germany. The [[European Union]] invests in several projects within the city of Berlin. Infrastructure, education and social programs are co-financed with budgets taken from EU cohesion funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erasmuspc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=303&amp;Itemid=61 URBAN regeneration, a European Commission initiative], ErasmusPC.

===City state===
[[File:Wowereit2008.JPG|upright|thumb|Governing Mayor since 2001, [[Klaus Wowereit]]]]

The city and state parliament is the [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]] (''Abgeordnetenhaus''), which currently has 141 seats. Berlin's [[executive (government)|executive]] body is the [[Senate of Berlin]] (''Senat von Berlin''). The Senate of Berlin consists of the [[List of mayors of Berlin|Governing Mayor]] (''Regierender Bürgermeister'') and up to eight senators holding ministerial positions, one of them holding the official title &quot;Mayor&quot; (''Bürgermeister'') as deputy to the Governing Mayor. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the [[Berlin state election, 2001|2001 state election]] and won another term in the [[Berlin state election, 2006|2006 state election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-berlin.de/wahlen/|title=Berlin state election, 2006|work=Der Landeswahlleiter für Berlin|accessdate=17 August 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the city (''Oberbürgermeister der Stadt'') and Prime Minister of the Federal State (''Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes''). The office of Berlin's Governing Mayor is in the [[Rotes Rathaus|Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall)]]. Since 2001 this office has been held by [[Klaus Wowereit]] of the SPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/050516/wowereit.html|title=The Glamor Guy|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Europe]]|date=8 May 2005|accessdate=17 August 2008}} See also: {{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/23/world/europe/23wowereit.html?ex=1161489600&amp;en=2129daf9965bf613&amp;ei=5070|title=Berlin Mayor, Symbol of Openness, Has National Appeal|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=17 August 2008|first=Mark|last=Landler|date=23 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's government is based on a coalition between the Social Democratic Party and [[Die Linke]].

The total annual state budget of Berlin in 2007 exceeded €20.5 ($28.7) billion including a budget surplus of €80 ($112) million. The figures indicate the first surplus in the history of the city state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,527721,00.html Berlin schafft erstes Etatplus seit dem Krieg](German), SpiegelOnline. Retrieved February, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to increasing growth rates and tax revenues, the Senate of Berlin calculates an increasing budget surplus in 2008. The total budget includes an estimated amount of €5.5 ($7.7) bn, which is directly financed by either the German government or the German Bundesländer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/berlin/article199345/Sarrazin_Keine_neuen_Schulden_mehr_ab_2008.htm|title=Sarrazin: Keine neuen Schulden mehr ab 2008|first=Joachim|last=Fahrun|work=[[Berliner Morgenpost]]|date=10 June 2008|accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainly due to reunification-related expenditures, Berlin as a German state has accumulated more debt than any other city in Germany, with the most current estimate being €60 ($84)bn in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1983556,00.html|title=Debt-Laden Berlin Goes to Court For Federal Aid|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=29 April 2006|accessdate=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the very high level of [[public sector debt]] prompted the Stabilitätsrat von Bund und Ländern (Council for Fiscal Stability of the Federal and Local States) to declare a possible fiscal emergency for the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/0,1518,764436,00.html|title=Vier Bundesländern drohen griechische Verhältnisse|work=[[Spiegel]]|accessdate=23 May 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Boroughs and localities of Berlin}}
[[File:BerlinDistricts.svg|thumb|right|Map of Berlin's twelve boroughs and their localities.]]

Berlin is subdivided into [[Boroughs and localities of Berlin|twelve boroughs]] (''Bezirke''), down from 23 boroughs before [[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform]]. Each borough contains a number of localities (''Ortsteile''), which often have historic roots in older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920 and became [[urbanized]] and incorporated into the city. Many residents strongly identify with their localities or boroughs. At present Berlin consists of 95 localities, which are commonly made up of several city neighborhoods—called ''[[Kiez]]'' in the [[Berlin dialect]]—representing small residential areas.

Each borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') and a borough mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The borough council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). The boroughs of Berlin are not independent municipalities, however. &lt;!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --&gt; The power of borough governments is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough mayors form the council of mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), led by the city's governing mayor, which advises the senate.

The localities have no local government bodies, and the administrative duties of the former locality representative, the ''Ortsvorsteher'', were taken over by the borough mayors.

===Sister cities===
Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.&lt;ref name=Berlinsistercities&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/staedteverbindungen/staedtepartnerschaft_ueberblick.de.html|title=Berlin's international city relations|work=Berlin Mayor's Office|accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Town twinning between Berlin and other cities began with Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification and later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the West, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.

There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, Conference of the World's Capital Cities.

Berlin has two commercial airports. [[Tegel International Airport]] (TXL), which lies within the city limits, and [[Schönefeld International Airport]] (SXF), which is situated just outside Berlin's south-eastern border in the state of Brandenburg. Both airports together handled 22,3 million passengers in 2010. In 2011, 88 airlines serve 164 destinations in 54 countries from Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airportzentrale.de/?p=4940|title=Airport BBI: Einzigartige, historische Chance für Berlin und Brandenburg|work=airportzentrale.de|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tegel Airport is the European hub of [[Air Berlin]], whereas Schönefeld services mainly low-cost airline travel.

Berlin's airport authority plans to transfer all of Berlin's air traffic in June 2012 to a newly built airport at Schönefeld, to be renamed [[Berlin-Brandenburg International Airport|Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] (BER).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin-airport.de/EN/BBI/|title=Airport Berlin Brandenburg International|work=Airports Berlin|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; City authorities want to establish a European aviation hub with a gateway to Asia.

Berlin is well known for its highly developed bike (cycle) lane system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/07/bike_city_berli.php|title=Bike City Berlin|work=Treehugger|accessdate=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that Berlin has 710 bicycles per 1000 residents. Around 500,000 daily bike riders accounted for 13% of total traffic in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neues-deutschland.de/artikel/193840.platz-da-8211-fuer-die-radfahrer.html|title=Platz da! – für die Radfahrer|work=ND|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riders have access to {{convert|620|km|abbr=on}} of bike paths including approx. {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}} mandatory bicycle paths, {{convert|190|km|abbr=on}} off-road bicycle routes, {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} of bike lanes on the roads, {{convert|70|km|abbr=on}} of shared bus lanes which are also open to bicyclists, {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} of combined pedestrian/bike paths and {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} of marked bike lanes on the sidewalks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/verkehr/radverkehrsanlagen/en/radwege.shtml|title=Bicycle Routes and Facilities Bicycle Paths|work=Senate Department of urban development|accessdate=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy===
[[File:Berlin HKW Mitte.jpg|thumb|upright|Heizkraftwerk Mitte]]

Berlin's energy is mainly supplied by the Swedish firm [[Vattenfall]], which relies more heavily than other electricity producers on [[lignite]] as an energy source. Because burning lignite produces harmful emissions, Vattenfall has announced its commitment to transitioning to cleaner sources, such as [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2006/05/30/a0166|title=Abgase tiefer gelegt|first=Nick|last=Reimer|work=[[Die Tageszeitung|taz]]|date=30 May 2006|accessdate=18 August 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the former West Berlin, electricity was supplied chiefly by thermal power stations. To facilitate buffering during load peaks, [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulators]] were installed during the 1980s at some of these power stations. These were connected by static inverters to the power grid and were loaded during times of low energy consumption and unloaded during periods of high consumption.

In 1993 the power grid connections to the surrounding areas, which had been cut in 1951, were restored. In the western districts of Berlin, nearly all power lines are underground cables; only a 380&amp;nbsp;kV and a 110&amp;nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380-kV electric line]] was built when West Berlin's electrical grid was not connected to those of East or West Germany. This has now become the backbone of the city's energy grid.

Car maker [[Daimler AG]] and the electric utility, RWE AG, are going to begin a joint electric car and [[charging station]] test project in Berlin called &quot;E-Mobility Berlin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/apwire/3e8bc7ee811bd771be83c3bf1960bbbc.htm]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin has a rich history of discoveries in medicine and innovations in medical technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/magazin/wissen/Elitewettbewerb-Universitaeten;art304,2400973|title=Berlin leuchtet|first1=Anja|last1=Kühne|first2=Tilmann|last2=Warnecke|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=18 August 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern history of medicine has been significantly influenced by scientists from Berlin. [[Rudolf Virchow]] was the founder of cellular pathology, while [[Robert Koch]] developed vaccines for anthrax, cholera, and tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charite.de/ch/neuro/lokales/charite/geschichte.html|title=History of the Charité of Berlin|work=[[Charité]]|date=6 September 2005|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Charité]] hospital complex is the largest [[university hospital]] in Europe, tracing back its origins to the year 1710. The Charité is spread over four sites and comprises 3,300 beds, around 14,000 staff, 8,000 students, and more than 60 operating theatres, and has a turnover of over one billion euros annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anselleurope.com/medical/index.cfm?Include=testimonials&amp;lang=EN&amp;I=4166|title=Customer company profile|work=Ansell Healthcare|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a joint institution of the [[Free University of Berlin]] and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], including a wide range of institutes and specialized medical centers. Among them are the German Heart Center, one of the most renowned transplantation centers, the Max-Delbrück-Center for Molecular Medicine and the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics. The scientific research at these institutions is complemented by many research departments of companies such as Siemens, Schering and Debis.

As of March 2010, the city-state of Berlin had a population of 3,440,441 registered inhabitants&lt;ref name=&quot;Population&quot; /&gt; in an area of {{convert|891.82|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;statoffice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-berlin.de/|title=Berlin statistical figures|work=[[Amt für Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg]]|accessdate=19 August 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's population density was 3,848 inhabitants per km² (9,966/sq&amp;nbsp;mi). The [[urban area]] of Berlin stretches beyond the city limits and comprises about 3.7&amp;nbsp;million people, while the metropolitan area of the Berlin-Brandenburg region is home to about 4.3&amp;nbsp;million in an area of {{convert|5370|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, following the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France, the city responded with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin. The act increased the area of Berlin from {{convert|66|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|883|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and the population from 1.9&amp;nbsp;million to 4&amp;nbsp;million.
&lt;br /&gt;
Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, Berlin is home to about 250,000 [[Turks in Germany|Turks]] (especially in [[Kreuzberg]], [[Neukölln]] and [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], a locality in the borough of [[Mitte]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;250k Turks&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/berlin-shish-and-sauerkraut-to-go-448678.html|title=Berlin: Shish And Sauerkraut To Go|first=Andrew|last=Spooner|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2007-05-13|accessdate=2010-05-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.

In the 1990s the ''Aussiedlergesetze'' enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former [[Soviet Union]]. Today ethnic [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|Germans]] from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russiajournal.com/node/4653 Berlin is speaking Russians' language]. The Russia Journal. 2001-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The current decade experiences an increasing influx from various Western countries. Especially young EU-Europeans are settling in the city. Additionally, Berlin has seen a rise of [[African]] immigrants during the last two decades.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.welt.de/print-wams/article616463/Berlin_wird_farbiger_Die_Afrikaner_kommen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Russian, Arabic, Polish, Kurdish, Vietnamese, English, Serbian, Croatian, Greek and other Asian languages. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Serbian and Croatian can be heard more often in the western part, due to the large Middle-Eastern and ex-Yugoslavian immigrant communities, whereas Vietnamese, Russian and Polish have more native speakers residing in the eastern part of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/wirtschaft/article1309952/Zwei-Millionen-Berliner-sprechen-mindestens-zwei-Sprachen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin's nightlife is one of the most diverse and vibrant of its kind in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=6949|title=Losing your mind in Berlin|first=Walter|last=Wasacz|work=[[Metro Times]]|date=11 October 2004|accessdate=18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1990s, people in their twenties from many countries, particularly those in Eastern and Central Europe, made Berlin's club scene the premier nightlife destination of Europe. After the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city center of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and [[counterculture]] gatherings. Mitte and surrounding boroughs are also home to many nightclubs, including [[Kunst Haus Tacheles]], [[techno]] clubs [[Tresor]], WMF, [[Ufo (Club, Berlin)|Ufo]], [[E-Werk]], [[KitKatClub]] and [[Berghain]]. The techno-music club, Linientreu, near the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]], has been in business since the late 1980s. The LaBelle discothèque in [[Friedenau]] became widely known as the location of the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germany.info/relaunch/politics//new/pol_libya_labelle_2004.html Compensating Victims of the La Belle Attack], German Embassy, Washington D.C..

An important theme in many of his publications, he has been credited as one of the fathers of this approach, often referred to as the &quot;[[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]&quot;, named after him and his mentor [[Edward Sapir]]. Originally educated as a chemical engineer, he took up an interest in linguistics late in his life, studying with Sapir at [[Yale University]]. In the last ten years of his life he dedicated his spare time to linguistic studies, doing field work on Native American languages in the US and Mexico. He managed to become one of the most influential linguists of his time, even while still working as a fire inspector for the [[The Hartford|Hartford Fire Insurance Company]]. He published a grammar of the [[Hopi language]], studies of [[Nahuatl]] dialects, [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic writing]], and the first attempt at a reconstruction of [[Uto-Aztecan]]. He also published many articles in the most prestigious linguistic journals, many of them dealing with the ways in which he saw that different linguistic systems affected the thought systems and habitual behaviour of language users.

==Biography==
The son of Harry and Sarah (Lee) Whorf, Benjamin Lee Whorf graduated from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1918 with a degree in [[chemical engineering]]. Shortly thereafter, he began work as a fire prevention engineer (i.e., an inspector) for the [[The Hartford|Hartford Fire Insurance Company]], pursuing linguistic and anthropological studies as an [[avocation]].

In 1931, Whorf began studying linguistics at [[Yale University]] and soon deeply impressed [[Edward Sapir]], who warmly supported Whorf's academic pursuits. In 1936, Whorf was appointed Honorary Research Fellow in Anthropology at Yale. In 1937, Yale awarded him the Sterling Fellowship. He was a Lecturer in Anthropology from 1937 through 1938, when he began having serious health problems.

Benjamin's younger brother, [[Richard Whorf]], was an actor in films such as [[Yankee Doodle Dandy]] and later [[Emmy]] nominated television director of such shows as [[The Beverly Hillbillies]].

Whorf died of cancer at the age of 44. He is mainly remembered for a posthumous collection of his work, titled ''Language, Thought, and Reality'', first published in 1956.

==Work==
Whorf said that having an independent, non-academic source of income allowed him to pursue his specific academic interests more freely. He disseminated his ideas not only by publishing numerous technical articles, but also by writings accessible to lay readers, and by popular lectures.

Whorf's primary area of interest in linguistics was the study of [[Native American (Americas)|Native American]] languages, particularly those of [[Mesoamerica]]. He became well known for his work on the [[Hopi language]], and for his principle of [[linguistic relativity]]. Among Whorf's beliefs about the Hopi was that: “… the Hopi language is seen to contain no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions or that refer directly to what we call “time”, or to past, present, or future…”&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=W2d1Q4el00QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%27%27Language+Thought+and+Reality:+Selected+Writings+of+Benjamin+Lee+Whorf%27%27&amp;ei=YRKNSKHyOIHAigHumfH7Bw&amp;sig=ACfU3U0-0aOK_v3HYwbXt0FxR-AVFVaT0A ''Language Thought and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf''], edited by John B.  Carroll, [[MIT Press]], [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], 1956, [http://worldcat.org/isbn/0262730065 ISBN 0262730065]&lt;/ref&gt; His understanding of Hopi has been questioned by subsequent scholars. According to [[Guy Deutscher (linguist)|Guy Deutscher]], for example, Hopi does have a variety of different tenses, but Whorf did not visit the Hopi in their native habitat and his understanding of the language came from one Indian who was living in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sjpsm |title=Interview with Guy Deutscher on Thinking Allowed BBC radio programme}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Deutscher's 2010 book, ''Through the Language Glass'', Heinemann, ISBN 9780434016907.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to a close friend and associate of Whorf's, [[John B. Carroll]], Whorf did indeed spend time with the Hopi in their native habitat in 1938.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; 

The [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], also known as the Whorfian hypothesis, proposed that language affects thought, and the structure of the language itself affects [[cognition]].

Some of Whorf's early work on linguistics and particularly on linguistic relativity was inspired by reports he wrote on insurance losses, in which misunderstanding based on linguistic confusion had been a contributing factor. In an incident recounted in his essay ''The Relation of Habitual Thought and Behavior to Language''.,&lt;ref name=whorf&gt;[http://www.generalsemantics.org/store/etc-a-review-of-general-semantics/145-etc-a-review-of-general-semantics-1-4-summer-1944.html The Relation of Habitual Thought and Behavior to Language,]&quot;, Benjamin Whorf, 1956, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf explains how the idea of language affecting thought first came to him. Employed as an investigator for a fire insurance company, his job was to investigate the causes of industrial fires. In his own words:

{{quotation|
&quot;My analysis was directed toward purely physical conditions, such as defective wiring, presence or lack of air spaces between metal flues and woodwork, etc., and the results were presented in these terms. ... But in due course it became evident that not only a physical situation qua physics, but the meaning of that situation to people, was sometimes a factor, through the behavior of people, in the start of a fire. And this factor of meaning was clearest when it was a LINGUISTIC MEANING [Whorf's emphasis], residing in the name or the linguistic description commonly applied to this situation. Thus, around a storage of what are called 'gasoline drums,' behavior will tend to a certain type, that is, great care will be exercised; while around a storage of what are called 'empty gasoline drums,' it will tend to be different — careless, with little repression of smoking or of tossing cigarette stubs about. Yet the 'empty' drums are perhaps the more dangerous, since they contain explosive vapor. Physically, the situation is hazardous, but the linguistic analysis according to regular analogy must employ the word 'empty,' which inevitably suggests a lack of hazard. The word 'empty' is used in two linguistic patterns: (1) as a virtual synonym for 'null and void, negative, inert,' (2) applied in analysis of physical situations without regard to, e.g., vapor, liquid vestiges, or stray rubbish, in the container.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;whorf&quot;/&gt;
}}

In studying the cause of a fire which had started under the conditions just described, Whorf concluded that it was ''thinking'' of the &quot;empty&quot; gasoline drums as &quot;empty&quot; in the meaning described in the first definition (1) above, that is as &quot;inert,&quot; which led to a fire he investigated. His papers and lectures featured many other examples from his insurance work to support his belief that language shapes understanding.  

Less well known, but important, are his contributions to the study of the [[Nahuatl]] and [[Mayan languages|Maya]] languages. He claimed that Nahuatl was an [[oligosynthetic language]] (a claim that would be brought up again some twenty years later by [[Morris Swadesh]], another controversial American linguist). In a series of published and unpublished studies in the 1930s, he argued that Mayan writing was phonetic to some degree. Although many details of his work on Maya are now known to have been incorrect, his central claim was vindicated by [[Yuri Knorozov]]'s syllabic decipherment of Mayan writing in the 1950s.

Bill Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe, III, at Julia Chester Hospital in [[Hope, Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.eircom.net/%257Eseanjmurphy/dir/pres.htm |title=Directory of Irish Genealogy: American Presidents with Irish Ancestors |publisher=Homepage.eircom.net |date=March 23, 2004 |accessdate=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; His father, [[William Jefferson Blythe, Jr.]], was a traveling [[salesman]] who died in an [[automobile]] accident three months before Bill was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse.gov bio&quot; /&gt; Following Bill's birth, to study nursing, his mother [[Virginia Clinton Kelley|Virginia Dell Cassidy]] (1923–1994), traveled to [[New Orleans]], leaving Bill in Hope with grandparents, Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and operated a small [[grocery store]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; At a time when the [[Southern United States]] was [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]], Bill's grandparents sold goods on [[credit (finance)|credit]] to people of all races.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and shortly thereafter married [[Roger Clinton, Sr.|Roger Clinton]], who, together with his brother, owned an [[Car dealership|automobile dealership]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clinton |first=Bill |title=My Life |publisher=[[Random House, Inc]] |year=2004 |isbn=140003003X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.

Although he assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Billy (as he was known then) turned fourteen that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; Clinton says he remembers his stepfather as a [[gambler]] and an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who regularly abused his mother and half-brother [[Roger Clinton, Jr.]], to the point where he intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maraniss |first=David |title=First In His Class: A Biography Of Bill Clinton |publisher=Touchstone |year=1996 |isbn= 0684818906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and [[Hot Springs High School (Arkansas)|Hot Springs High School]]&amp;nbsp;– where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; Fellow students included the late watercolorist and sculptor, Tonya Bailey. He was in the chorus and played the [[tenor saxophone]], winning first chair in the state band's [[saxophone]] section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his [[autobiography]] ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'':
{{quote|&quot;Sometime in my sixteenth year, I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official. I loved music and thought I could be very good, but I knew I would never be [[John Coltrane]] or [[Stan Getz]].

But I knew I could be great in public service.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;}}

In 1963, two influential moments in Clinton's life contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a [[Boys Nation]] senator to the [[White House]] to meet President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; The other was listening to [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King's]] 1963 ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech.

==College and law school years==
With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C., receiving a [[List of tagged degrees|Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service]] (B.S.) degree in 1968. He spent the summer of 1967, the summer before his senior year, [[intern]]ing for Arkansas [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[J. William Fulbright]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; While in college, he became a brother of [[Alpha Phi Omega]] and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. Clinton was also a member of the Order of [[DeMolay International|DeMolay]], a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].&lt;ref&gt;Political Base.

Upon graduation, he won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[University College, Oxford]] where he studied [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]], though because he had switched programs and had left early for Yale University, he did not obtain a degree there.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/world/oxford-journal-whereas-he-is-an-old-boy-if-a-young-chief-honor-him.html |title=Oxford Journal; Whereas, He Is an Old Boy, If a Young Chief, Honor Him|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 17, 2009 | date=June 9, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an interest in [[rugby union]], playing at Oxford&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Nick &amp; Growden, Greg &quot;Chapter 21: Ten Peculiar Facts about Rugby&quot; in ''Rugby Union for Dummies'' (2nd Edition), p. 297 (pub: John Wiley and Sons, [[Chichester]], England) ISBN 978-0-470-03537-5&lt;/ref&gt; and later for the Little Rock Rugby club in Arkansas. While at Oxford he also participated in [[Vietnam War]] [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|protests]], including organizing an October 1969 [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] event.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; In later life, he admitted smoking [[cannabis]] at the university, but famously said that he &quot;never inhaled&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

Clinton's political opponents charge that to avoid being drafted into the [[Vietnam War]] during his college years, he used the political influence of a U.S. Senator, who employed him as an aide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/etc/draftletter.html |title=Bill Clinton's Draft Letter |work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] | publisher=PBS |date=November 23, 1991 |accessdate=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Col.

Clinton did not join the [[ROTC]] program, but the temporary ROTC status prevented him from being drafted. This was legal, but it became a source of criticism from conservatives and some Vietnam veterans during the 1992 national campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John D.

After Oxford, Clinton attended [[Yale Law School]] and obtained a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) degree in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; While at Yale, he began dating fellow law student [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Rodham]], who was a year ahead of him. They married on October 11, 1975, and their only child, [[Chelsea Clinton|Chelsea]], was born on February 27, 1980.

During his time at Yale, Clinton took a job with the 1972 [[George McGovern|McGovern]] campaign and was assigned to lead McGovern's effort in Texas. He spent considerable time in [[Dallas, Texas]], at the McGovern campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. There, Clinton worked with [[Ron Kirk]], who was later elected mayor of Dallas twice, future governor of Texas, [[Ann Richards]], and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker), [[Steven Spielberg]].

{{See|Electoral history of Bill Clinton}}

===Governor of Arkansas===
{{See|Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1978|Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1980|Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1982}}
After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the [[University of Arkansas]]. A year later, he ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1974. The incumbent, [[John Paul Hammerschmidt]], defeated Clinton by a 52% to 48% margin. Without opposition in the general election, Clinton was elected [[Arkansas Attorney General]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Bill Clinton 1978.jpg|thumb|left|Clinton, as the newly elected [[Governor of Arkansas]], meeting with President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1978]]
Clinton was elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate [[Lynn Lowe]], a farmer from [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]]. He became the youngest governor in the country at age 32. He worked on educational reform and Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of [[Cuba]]n refugees (from the [[Mariel boatlift]]) detained in [[Fort Chaffee]] in 1980. [[Monroe Schwarzlose]] of [[Kingsland, Arkansas|Kingsland]] in [[Cleveland County, Arkansas|Cleveland County]], polled 31% of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat in the general election that year by [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challenger [[Frank D. White]]. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

Clinton joined friend [[Bruce Lindsey]]'s Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings,{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} though he spent most of the next two years working on his re-election campaign.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Clinton was again elected governor and kept his job for ten years.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

He helped [[Arkansas]] transform its economy and significantly improve the state's educational system. He became a leading figure among the [[New Democrats]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot;/&gt; The New Democrats, organized as the [[Democratic Leadership Council|Democratic Leadership Council (DLC)]], were a branch of the Democratic Party that called for welfare reform and smaller government, a policy supported by both Democrats and Republicans. He gave the [[Democratic response to the State of the Union address|Democratic response]] to President Reagan's [[1985 State of the Union Address]] and served as Chair of the [[National Governors Association]] from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

Clinton made economic growth, job creation and educational improvement high priorities. For [[senior citizens]], he removed the [[sales tax]] from [[medication]]s and increased the home property-tax exemption.

In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee, chaired by Clinton's wife, attorney and [[Legal Services Corporation]] chair [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], succeeded in reforming the education system, transforming it from the worst in the nation into one of the best. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. Clinton and the committee were responsible for state educational improvement programs, notably more spending for schools, rising opportunities for gifted children, an increase in vocational education, raising of teachers' salaries, inclusion of a wider variety of courses, and mandatory teacher testing for aspiring educators.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

In 1980, during the first gubernatorial term of Clinton, then editorial page editor of the Pine Bluff Commercial, Paul Greenberg, gave Clinton the nickname &quot;Slick Willie.&quot;&lt;ref name=WaPoNickname&gt;{{Cite news| title = It's Come To This: A Nickname That's Proven Hard to Slip | last = Merida| first = Kevin| date = December 20, 1998|work=The Washington Post | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/slick122098.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clintons' personal and business affairs during the 1980s included transactions that became the basis of the [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]] investigation that dogged his later presidential administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clinton Wars&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blumenthal |first=Sidney |title=The Clinton Wars |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |edition=1st |year=2003 |isbn= 0374125023}}&lt;/ref&gt; After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Harris |first=John F. |title=The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House |publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks |year=2006 |edition=1st |isbn= 0375760849 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), and businessmen [[Woody Freeman]] of [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]], (1984) and [[Sheffield Nelson]] of Little Rock (1990).

===Democratic presidential primaries of 1988===
[[File:Reagans with the Clintons.jpg|thumb|Governor and Mrs. Clinton attend the Dinner Honoring the Nation's Governors in the [[White House]] with President [[Ronald Reagan]] and first lady [[Nancy Reagan]], 1987.]]
In 1987, there was media speculation Clinton would enter the race after then-[[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Mario Cuomo]] declined to run and Democratic front-runner [[Gary Hart]] withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored&amp;nbsp;– but ultimately vetoed&amp;nbsp;– by the First Lady).&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot;&gt;David Maraniss, ''First in His Class: A Biography of Bill Clinton'' (New York: Random House, 1996; ISBN 978-0-684-81890-0).&lt;/ref&gt; For the nomination, Clinton endorsed [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Michael Dukakis]]. However, he did give the opening night address at the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]], which was nationally televised, but it was criticized for length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Church|first=George J.|title=Cover: Is Bill Clinton For Real? |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,974739,00.html|work=Time|date=January 27, 1992|accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presenting himself as a moderate and a member of the [[New Democrat]] wing of the Democratic Party, he headed the moderate [[Democratic Leadership Council]] in 1990 and 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Woodward |first=Bob |title=The Choice: How Bill Clinton Won |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |edition= |year=2005 |isbn= 074328514X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1992 presidential campaign==
{{See|Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1992|United States presidential election, 1992|Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992}}

Due to his youthful appearance, he was often called the &quot;Boy Governor&quot;. In the first contest, the [[Iowa caucus]], he finished a very distant third to Iowa Senator [[Tom Harkin]]. During the campaign for the [[New Hampshire primary]], reports of an extramarital affair with [[Gennifer Flowers]] surfaced. As Clinton fell far behind former [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[Paul Tsongas]] in the New Hampshire polls,&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; following the [[Super Bowl]], Clinton and his wife Hillary went on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the [[New Hampshire Democratic primary, 1992|New Hampshire primary]], but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. On election night, Clinton labeled himself &quot;The Comeback Kid&quot;, earning a firm second-place finish.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the [[Southern United States|Southern primaries]] gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside of his native South.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot; /&gt;

With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted the New York primary, which contained a large number of delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot; /&gt; Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in [[Jerry Brown]]'s home state of California.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Debates.jpg|thumb|250|Bill Clinton with [[Ross Perot]], Independent, and President [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Republican party (United States)|Republican]], in a national debate]]
Clinton won the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] (43.0% of the vote) against Republican incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]] (37.4% of the vote) and billionaire [[populism|populist]] [[Ross Perot]], who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote) on a platform focusing on domestic issues; a significant part of Clinton's success was Bush's steep decline in public approval. Because Bush's [[United States Presidential approval rating|approval ratings]] were in the 80% range during the [[Gulf War]], he was described as unbeatable. However, when Bush compromised with Democrats in an attempt to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his [[Read my lips: no new taxes|promise not to raise taxes]], hurting his approval rating.

Clinton's election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the [[White House]] and twenty of the previous twenty-four years.

However, during the campaign, questions of [[conflict of interest]] regarding state business and the politically powerful [[Rose Law Firm]], at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose.

Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. In his inaugural address he declared:

Clinton in his first address to the nation on February 15, 1993, announced his intention to raise taxes to cap the budget deficit.&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Times]], 02/16/93, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 1993, in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on deficit reduction rather than a middle-class tax cut, which had been high on his campaign agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/cron/ |title=frontline: the clinton years: chronology |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Clinton's advisers, including Robert Rubin formerly of Goldman Sachs, pressured him to raise taxes on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Bob, ''Maestro'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000), p 116&lt;/ref&gt;) (In December 2010, Clinton defended President Barack Obama's compromise with the Republican congressional leadership, extending the George W.

A13.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Shortly after taking office, Clinton signed the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]], which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. While this action was popular, Clinton's attempt to fulfill another campaign promise to overturn the policy banning openly [[homosexuality|gay men and women]] from serving in the armed forces garnered criticism from the left (for being too tentative in promoting [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]]) and from the right (who opposed any effort to allow gays to serve). Congress inserted the ban into a defense spending bill which Clinton signed, but he subsequently modified the ban by instituting a Department of Defense directive known as &quot;[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]&quot;, which allowed gay people to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexuality a secret, and prohibited the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation. Some gay rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n11_v28/ai_18855826 Stranger Among Friends. - book reviews] - John Cloud, ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', November 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaymilitary.ucsb.edu/PressClips/03_0110_WashingtonBladeEd.htm Washington Blade Editorial: Bush Has Mandate to Let Gays Serve] - Kevin Naff, Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military, January 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President [[Harry Truman]] used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argue that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt; Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not &quot;out of whack.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/1999/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/11/clinton.gays.military/index.html|title=President seeks better implementation of 'don't ask, don't  tell' -|date=December 11, 1999|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1993, Clinton controversially supported ratification of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] by the U.S. Senate. Clinton, along with most of his Democratic Leadership Committee allies, strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong intra-party disagreement. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of [[Ross Perot]]. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the President on January 1, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, C. Don, Kenneth A. Wink; &quot;The Passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the U.S. House of Representatives: Presidential Leadership or Presidential Luck?&quot; Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 27, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the [[Brady Bill]], which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases. He also expanded the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]], a subsidy for low-income workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; According to Whitney Tilson and Glenn Tongue, &quot;During the 1990s, the Clinton administration pushed [[Fannie Mae|Fannie]] and [[Freddie Mac|Freddie]] to support more lending in low-income communities and used the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] to encourage (some would say coerce) banks to do same.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

One of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda was the result of a taskforce headed by [[Hillary Clinton]], which was [[Clinton health care plan|a health care reform plan]] aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. Though initially well received in political circles, it was ultimately doomed by well-organized opposition from conservatives, the [[American Medical Association]], and the health insurance industry. However, [[John F. Harris]], a biographer of Clinton's, states the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died. It was the first major legislative defeat of Clinton's administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt;
Two months later, after two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress in the [[U.S. House election, 1994|mid-term elections in 1994]], for the first time in forty years.

In August 1993, Clinton signed the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]], which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for fifteen million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90% of small businesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/legacy/080393-presidential-press-conference-in-nevada.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927022455/http://www.clintonfoundation.org/legacy/080393-presidential-press-conference-in-nevada.htm|archivedate=September 27, 2007|title=Presidential Press Conference - 08/03/1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2% of taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clintonpresidentialcenter.org/legacy/012594-speech-by-president-sotu-address.htm 1994 State of the Union Address]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, through the implementation of spending restraints, it mandated the budget be balanced over a number of years.

As part of a 1996 initiative to curb [[illegal immigration]], Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act ([[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996|IIRIRA]]). Appointed by Clinton,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://articles.sfgate.com/1995-06-02/news/17808549_1_legal-immigrants-immigration-agenda-commission-on-immigration-reform New Limits In Works on Immigration / Powerful commission focusing on families of legal entrants]&quot;.

Senators [[Ted Kennedy]]&amp;nbsp;– a Democrat&amp;nbsp;– and [[Orrin Hatch]], a Republican, teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the [[Children's Health Insurance Program]], the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] and two years later Rodham Clinton succeeded in helping pass the [[Foster Care Independence Act]]. President Bill Clinton supported both bills as well, and signed both of them into law.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

====Travelgate controversy====
{{Main|White House travel office controversy}}
Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office in May 1993, causing a controversy even though the Travel Office staff served at the pleasure of the President and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done because of financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. Critics contended the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.

====White House FBI files controversy====
The White House FBI-files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to [[FBI]] security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations. In March 2000, Independent Counsel [[Robert Ray (prosecutor)|Robert Ray]] determined that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity. Ray's report further stated, &quot;there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved&quot; in seeking the files.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/07/28/clinton.filegate/|title=Independent counsel: No evidence to warrant prosecution against first lady in 'filegate'| work = CNN | date = July 28, 2000 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Death penalty====
{{See|Capital punishment in Arkansas|Capital punishment by the United States federal government}}

The application of the federal death penalty was expanded to include crimes not resulting in death&amp;nbsp;– such as running a large-scale drug enterprise&amp;nbsp;– by Clinton's 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, &quot;My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Clinton|url=http://www.4to40.com/legends/print.asp?p=Bill_Clinton|work= 4to40.com |accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While campaigning for U.S. President, the then Governor Clinton returned to Arkansas to see that [[Ricky Ray Rector]] would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to Arkansas state and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in a ''[[The New York Times]]'' article as a possible political move to counter &quot;soft on crime&quot; accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Applebome|first=Peter|title=Arkansas Execution Raises Questions on Governor's Politics|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEED91F3EF936A15752C0A964958260 |work=The New York Times|date=January 25, 1992|accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;mbsrgd&quot;&gt;[[George Stephanopoulos]], ''All Too Human: A Political Education'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Clinton was the first President to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reintroduced in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/clemency|title=Clemency |publisher=[[Death Penalty Information Center]]|accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal executions were resumed under his successor [[George W. Bush]].

====Assassination attempt====
Law professor Ken Gromley's book ''The Death of American Virtue'' reveals that Clinton escaped a 1996 assassination attempt in [[the Philippines]] by terrorists working for [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307409449 |title=The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his visit to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in [[Manila]] in 1996, he was saved shortly before his car was due to drive over a bridge where a bomb had been planted. Gromley said he was told the details of the bomb plot by Louis Merletti, a former director of the Secret Service. Clinton was scheduled to visit a local politician in central Manila, when secret service officers intercepted a message suggesting that an attack was imminent. A transmission used the words &quot;bridge&quot; and &quot;wedding&quot;, supposedly a terrorist's code words for assassination. The motorcade was re-routed and the US agents later discovered a bomb planted under the bridge. The report said the subsequent US investigation into the plot &quot;revealed that it was masterminded by a Saudi terrorist living in Afghanistan named Osama bin Laden&quot;. Gromley said, &quot;It remained top secret except to select members of the US intelligence community. At the time, there were media reports about the discovery of two bombs, one at Manila airport and another at the venue for the leaders' meeting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Bin-laden-had-almost-killed-Clinton--says-a-new-book/558206/ |title=Bin laden had almost killed Clinton, says a new book |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=December 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]], Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2% of the popular vote over Republican [[Bob Dole]] (40.7% of the popular vote) and [[Reform Party USA|Reform]] candidate [[Ross Perot]] (8.4% of the popular vote), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin Roosevelt to be elected President more than once. The Republicans lost a few seats in the House and gained a few in the Senate, but retained control of both. Clinton received 379, or over 70% of the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.

While the [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings ended in a straight-party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]]. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony about his relationship to [[Monica Lewinsky]] during a sexual harassment lawsuit (later dismissed, appealed and settled for $850,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/pjones/pjones.htm|title=Case Closed | work=The Washington Post | date=August 26, 1999 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought by former Arkansas state employee [[Paula Jones]]. The obstruction charge was based on his actions during the subsequent investigation of that testimony. The Senate later voted to acquit Clinton on both charges.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;CNN-Clinton_aquiter&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate refused to convene to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm [[Williams &amp; Connolly]].

The Senate concluded a twenty-one day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote on both counts falling short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an office holder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty. Some Republicans voted not guilty for both charges. On the perjury charge, fifty-five senators voted to acquit, including ten Republicans, and forty-five voted to convict; on the obstruction charge the Senate voted 50–50.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=How the senators voted on impeachment |publisher=CNN |date=February 12, 1999 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/12/senate.vote/ |accessdate=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Law license suspension=====
In 2000, the Arkansas Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct called for Clinton's [[disbarment]], saying he lied about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.

In January 2001, Clinton was ordered to pay $25,000 in fines to Arkansas state's bar officials and his Arkansas law license was suspended for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Clinton to contest Supreme Court suspension |publisher=CNN |date=October 2, 2001 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/LAW/10/01/scotus.clinton/ |accessdate=December 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement came on the condition that Whitewater prosecutors would not pursue federal [[perjury]] charges against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bill Clinton Disbarment to End |publisher=AP/11alive.com |date=January 18, 2006 |url=http://www.11alive.com/rss/article.aspx?storyid=74815 |accessdate=December 21, 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton was suspended by the Supreme Court in October 2001, and, facing disbarment from that court, Clinton resigned from the Supreme Court bar in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Clinton asks to quit Supreme Court Bar |publisher=CNN |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/11/09/clinton.bar/ |date=November 9, 2001 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous military events occurred during Clinton's presidency.
The [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] also occurred in [[Somalia]] in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. [[MH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopters were shot down by [[rocket-propelled grenade]] attacks to their [[tail rotor]]s, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets&amp;nbsp;– a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground.

In 1995, U.S. and [[NATO]] aircraft [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|attacked Bosnian Serb targets]] to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and to pressure them into a peace accord. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent [[Dayton Agreement]].

In response to the 1998 [[al-Qaeda]] bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed a dozen Americans and hundreds of Africans, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan. He was subsequently criticized when it turned out that a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan (originally alleged to be a chemical warfare plant) had been destroyed.

In Clinton's 1998 [[State of the Union Address]], he warned Congress of Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]]'s possible pursuit of nuclear weapons:
{{quote|Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons, and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them. Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, &quot;You cannot defy the will of the world&quot;, and when I say to him, &quot;You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Senate Ratifies Historic Treaties Securing Copyright Online |date=January 27, 1998 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/states/docs/sou98.htm|work=The Washington Post |accessdate=July 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

[[File:Clinton and jiang.jpg|thumb|Bill Clinton and [[Jiang Zemin]] holding a joint press conference at the White House, October 29, 1997]]

To weaken Saddam Hussein's grip of power, Clinton signed H.R. 4655 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of &quot;regime change&quot; against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not speak to the use of American military forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.4655.ENR: Iraq Liberation Act of 1998], H.R.4655, One Hundred Fifth Congress of United States of America at Second Session; Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070218092435/http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/libera.htm The Iraq Liberation Act, Statement by the President], Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release, October 31, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named [[Operation Desert Fox]], lasting from December 16 to December 19, 1998. For the last two years of Clinton's presidency, U.S. aircraft routinely attacked hostile Iraqi anti-air installations inside the Iraqi no-fly zones.

After initial successes such as the [[Oslo accords]] of the early 1990s, Clinton attempted to address the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]]. Clinton brought Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]] and Palestinian Authority Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] together at [[Camp David]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; Following the peace talk failures, Clinton stated Arafat &quot;missed the opportunity&quot; to facilitate a &quot;just and lasting peace.&quot; In his [[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|autobiography]], Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shyovitz, David.

====Whitewater controversy====
{{Main|Whitewater controversy}}
The Whitewater controversy was an American political controversy that began with the [[real estate]] dealings of Bill and [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]] and their associates [[Jim McDougal|Jim]] and [[Susan McDougal]] in the [[Whitewater Development Corporation]], a failed business venture in the 1970s and 1980s.

In November 1993, [[David Hale (Whitewater)|David Hale]], the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater affair, alleged that Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater land deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon031798&quot;&gt;Jonathan Broder; [[Murray Waas]], [http://www.salon.com/news/1998/03/cov_17news.html &quot;The road to Hale&quot;], [[Salon.com|Salon]], March 17, 1998. Retrieved August 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] investigation did result in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains innocence in the affair.

===Attempted capture of Osama bin Laden===
Capturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the United States government from the presidency of Bill Clinton until bin Laden's assassination in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/24/clinton.binladen/index.html |title=Bill Clinton: I got closer to killing bin Laden |publisher=CNN |date= |accessdate=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been asserted that in 1996 while the Clinton Administration had begun pursuit of the policy, the Sudanese government allegedly offered to arrest and extradite Bin Laden as well as to provide the United States detailed intelligence information about growing militant organizations in the region, including [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]],&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/05/opinion/oe-ijaz05 |title=Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastisize |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 5, 2001 |accessdate=June 13, 2010 | first=Mansoor | last=Ijaz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer, despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in bombings on American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes.com&quot;/&gt;

However, the [[9/11 Commission]] found that although &quot;former Sudanese officials claim that Sudan offered to expel Bin Laden to the United States&quot;, &quot;we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_5.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Staff Statement No. 5.doc.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, two years after the warning, the Clinton administration ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden that failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lichtblau|first=Eric|title=State Dept.

===Troopergate===
{{Main|Troopergate (Bill Clinton)}}
Troopergate is the popular name of a [[scandal]] involving allegations by two [[Arkansas]] state troopers that they arranged sexual liaisons for then-Governor Bill Clinton. The allegations by state troopers [[Larry Patterson]] and Roger Perry were first reported by [[David Brock]] in [[the American Spectator]] in 1993, then confirmed the next day in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. The story mentioned a woman named ''Paula'', a reference to [[Paula Jones]]. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated &quot;bad journalism&quot; and that &quot;the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;apology&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/10/brocks.remorse/ | title=Reporter Apologizes For Clinton Sex Article | publisher=CNN |date= March 10, 1998 | first= | last= | accessdate =October 17, 2008| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080614124146/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/10/brocks.remorse/| archivedate = June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]], and 305 judges to the [[United States district courts]]. His 373 judicial appointments is second in American history, behind Ronald Reagan's. Clinton also experienced a number of [[Bill Clinton judicial appointment controversies|judicial appointment controversies]], as 24 nominees to 20 different [[United States federal judge|federal appellate judgeships]] were not processed by the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]-controlled [[Senate Judiciary Committee]].

Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.

The [[Gallup Organization]] published a poll in February 2007, asking respondents to name the greatest president in U.S. history; Clinton came in fourth place, capturing 13% of the vote. In a 2006 [[Quinnipiac University]] poll asking respondents to name the best president since World War II, Clinton ranked 3% behind [[Ronald Reagan]] to place second with 25% of the vote. However, in the same poll, when respondents were asked to name the worst president since World War II, Clinton placed 1% behind [[Richard Nixon]] and 18% behind [[George W.

Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward state Clinton's innovative use of [[sound bite]]-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning was a major factor in his high public approval ratings.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Walker, Clinton: the President they deserve, Fourth Estate 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Woodward, The choice: how Clinton won, Touchstone 1996, ISBN 0-684-81308-4&lt;/ref&gt; When Clinton played the saxophone on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', he was described by some religious conservatives as &quot;the [[MTV]] president.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bresler |first=Robert J. |title=The Muddled Meaning of the 2000 Election |publisher=USA Today (Society for the Advancement of Education)

Clinton drew strong support from the African American community and made improving race relations a major theme of his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&amp;b=122950 A Conversation With President Bill Clinton on Race in America Today] - interview with Clinton, [[Center for American Progress]], July 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Toni Morrison]] in [[The New Yorker]] called Clinton &quot;the first Black president&quot;, saying, &quot;Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, [[McDonald's]]-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas&quot;, and comparing Clinton's sex life, scrutinized despite his career accomplishments, to the stereotyping and [[double standards]] that blacks typically endure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison |first=Toni |authorlink=Toni Morrison|coauthors= |title=Clinton as the first black president |work=|publisher=The New Yorker|month=October |year=1998|url=http://ontology.buffalo.edu./smith/clinton/morrison.html|doi= |accessdate=December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Morrison's sentiments were raised anew as [[Barack Obama]], who would later become the country's first African-American President, ran for the presidency. After endorsing Obama, Morrison distanced herself from her 1998 remark about Clinton, saying that it was misunderstood. She noted that she has &quot;no idea what his real instincts are, in terms of race&quot; and said she was only describing the way he was being treated during the impeachment trial as an equivalent to a poor black person living in the ghetto.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Andrea.

===Sexual misconduct allegations===
Throughout his career, Clinton has been subject to various allegations of sexual misconduct, though he as only admitted extramarital relationships with [[Monica Lewinsky]] and [[Gennifer Flowers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E4D91739F937A25750C0A96E958260| title=Testing of a President: The Accuser; Jones Lawyers Issue Files Alleging Clinton Pattern of Harassment of Women|work=The New York Times | date=March 14, 1998| quote=The Presidential deposition released today confirmed several revelations reported earlier, including Mr. Clinton's confirmation... that he had had sex with Gennifer Flowers, a one-time Arkansas worker. | accessdate=March 20, 2008 | first=Francis X. | last=Clines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For alleged misconduct during his governorship, [[Paula Jones]] brought a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton while he was president. Clinton argued that as a sitting president, he should not be vulnerable to a civil suit of this nature. The case landed in the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that &quot;Deferral of this litigation until petitioner's Presidency ends is not constitutionally required.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=95-1853 &quot;Clinton v.

However, a U.S. judge in Arkansas, [[Susan Webber Wright]], ruled that since Jones had not suffered any damages, the case should be dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/pjones/docs/order040198.htm | title = Judge Wright's Opinion | work=The Washington Post | date=April 1, 1998 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 1998, Judge [[Susan Webber Wright]] dismissed Jones' lawsuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;JO#$&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/02/clinton.jones.reax/ |title=Clinton Welcomes Jones Decision; Appeal Likely - April 2, 1998 |publisher=CNN |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 1998, Jones appealed the dismissal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/jonesappeal073198.htm |title=Text of Jones's Appeal |date = July 31, 1998 | work = [[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 1998, Clinton agreed to an out-of-court settlement, and agreed to pay Jones and her attorneys a sum of $850,000.00.&lt;ref name=&quot;CO{}{&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/11/18/jones/ |title=Appeals court ponders Paula Jones settlement - November 18, 1998 |publisher=CNN |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton, however, still offered no apology to Jones and still denied ever engaging in a sexual affair with her.&lt;ref name=&quot;CO{}{&quot; /&gt;

In 1998, [[Kathleen Willey]] alleged Clinton sexually assaulted her four years previously. In 1998, [[Juanita Broaddrick]] alleged Clinton raped her some twenty years previously. The accusations by Willey and Broaddrick were never brought before a court. The independent counsel determined Willey gave &quot;false information&quot; to the FBI and inconsistent sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.&lt;ref name=wilo9r&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/23/time/willey.html | title=The Lives Of Kathleen Willey | publisher=CNN |date= March 30, 1998 | first= | last= | accessdate =2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Willey was also able to dodge perjury charges after Kenneth Starr granted her immunity for her testimony.&lt;ref name=wilo9r /&gt;  Broaddrick's only sworn testimony about Clinton was a previous denial of any harassment by Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/broaddrick022599.htm|title=Clinton Accuser's Story Aired | work=The Washington Post | date=March 14, 1999 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gennifer Flowers]], [[Elizabeth Ward Gracen]], [[Sally Perdue]], and Dolly Kyle Browning each have reported having [[Adultery|adulterous]] sexual relations with Clinton during or before his service as governor.

In the publication process, Browning asserted that Clinton did everything in his power to prohibit and undermine publication. Browning sued Clinton for damages, but the US Court of Appeals denied her appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/federal/judicial/dc/opinions/01opinions/01-5050a.html |title=Dolly Kyle Browning v.

Just as Clinton was leaving elective office, his wife was entering it, as a U.S. Senator from New York. Bill Clinton proceeded to give speeches around the world, often for over $100,000 a speech.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Gerstein, ''Clinton Eligible, Once Again, To Practice Law'', New York Sun, January 17, 2006, downloaded from [http://www.nysun.com/article/25965?page_no=2 N.Y. Sun article].&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, Clinton has spoken at the last six [[Democratic National Conventions]], dating back to 1988.

===Activities up until 2008 campaign===
In 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive [[Iraq War|military action against Iraq]] would have unwelcome consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0210/02/ip.00.html |title=Cnn Inside Politics |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/clinton-urges-caution-over-iraq-as-bush-is-granted-war-powers-607775.html The Independent. &quot;Clinton urges caution over Iraq as Bush is granted war powers&quot;]: &quot;As a preemptive action today, however well-justified, may come back with unwelcome consequences in the future. And because I don't care&amp;nbsp;– and I've done this. I've ordered these kinds of actions. I don't care how precise your bombs and your weapons are, when you set them off, innocent people will die.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Montreal]].

The [[William J.

The [[William J.

The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global [[public health]], poverty alleviation and religious and [[ethnic conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/|title=Clinton Global Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcast.net/news/index.jsp?cat=GENERAL&amp;fn=/2006/05/03/383279.html |title=William J.

===2008 presidential election===
During the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign]], Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, [[Hillary Clinton]].

[[Image:L Old London.svg|right|thumb|[[Blackletter]] ''L'']]
The '''black letter law''' refers to the basic standard elements for a particular field of [[law]], which are generally known and free from doubt or dispute. It may, for example, be the standard elements for a [[contract]] or the technical definition of [[Battery (tort)|battery]].

The term &quot;black-letter law&quot; is also used commonly in the American legal system to mean well-established [[case law]]. 

At least in English law, black letter law is a term used to describe those areas of law characterized by technical rules, rather than those areas of law characterized by having a more conceptual basis. Contract, [[tort]] and [[Real property|land law]] are typical black letter law subjects, whereas [[administrative law]], for example, would be considered considerably less black letter.

==History and etymology==
The phrase does not come from association with [[Black's Law Dictionary]], which was first published in 1891. The phrase &quot;black-letter law&quot; was used in the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] case ''Naglee v. Ingersoll,'' 7 Pa. 185 (1847), almost 50 years before the first publication of Black's. There is also a [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case that predates the dictionary, ''Jackson ex dem Bradford v. Huntington'', that uses the phrase &quot;[[black letter]]&quot; in the same sense as black letter law: &quot;It is seldom that a case in our time savors so much of the black letter, but the course of decisions in New York renders it unavailable . . .&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Jackson ex dem Bradford v. Huntington'', 30 U.S. 402, 432 (1831).&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, it presumably refers to the practice of setting law books and citing legal precedents in [[blackletter]] type, a tradition that survived long after the switch to roman and italic text for other printed works. 

The phrase definitely refers to a distillation of the [[common law]] into general and accepted legal principles. You can see this in the quote above from the Supreme Court where the Court is noting that while the black letter law is clear, [[New York]] precedent deviates from the general principles.

In [[common law]], black letter legal doctrine is an informal term indicating the basic principles of [[law]] generally accepted by the [[court]]s and/or embodied in the [[statutes]] of a particular [[jurisdiction]]. Letter of the law is its actual implementation, thereby demonstrating that black letter law are those [[statutes]], rules, [[acts]], [[laws]], provisions, etc. that are or have been written down, codified, or indicated somewhere in [[legal]] texts throughout history of specific [[State (polity)|state]] law. This is often the case for many [[precedent]]s that have been set in the [[common law]]. An example of such a state within the [[common law jurisdiction]], and using the black letter [[legal doctrine]] is [[Canada]]. Being a [[monarchical state]], with its roots invested in [[Colonial England]], black letter law is that which is a term used to describe basic [[principles of law]] that are accepted by the [[majority of judges]] in most [[provinces]] and [[Territories of Canada|territories]]. Sometimes this is referred to as &quot;[[hornbook law]]&quot; meaning [[treatise]] or textbook, often relied upon as [[authoritative]], competent, and generally accepted in the field of Canadian law. In [[Legal English|lawyer lingo]], hornbook law or black letter law is a fundamental and well-accepted legal principle that does not require any further explanation, since a hornbook is a primer of basics. Law is the rule which establish that a [[principle]], [[provision]], [[references]], [[inference]], [[observation]], etc. may not require further explanation or clarification when the very nature of them shows that they are basic and elementary.

==Similar phrases==
The phrase is nearly synonymous with the phrase &quot;[[horn book law]]&quot;. There are a number of  venerable legal sources that distill the common law on various subjects known as [[Restatement of the Law]]. The specific titles will be &quot;The Restatement (First) of Contracts&quot; or &quot;The Restatement of Agency&quot; etc. Each of these volumes is divided into sections that begin with a text in boldface that summarizes a basic rule on an aspect of the law of contracts, agency etc. This &quot;restatement&quot; is followed by commentary and examples that expand on the principle stated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|laws created to enforce strict moral standards|early Colony of Connecticut laws|Blue Laws (Connecticut)}}

A '''blue law''' is a type of law, typically found in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], designed to enforce religious standards, particularly the observance of Sunday as a day of worship or rest, and a restriction on [[Sunday shopping]]. Most have been repealed, have been declared unconstitutional, or are simply unenforced; though prohibitions on the sale of [[alcoholic beverage]]s or prohibitions of almost all commerce on Sundays are still enforced in many areas. Blue laws often prohibit an activity only during certain hours and there are usually exceptions to the prohibition of commerce, like grocery and drug stores. In some places blue laws may be enforced due to religious principles, but others are retained as a matter of tradition or out of convenience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/blue+law&amp;r=67 Answers.com: Encyclopedia Britannica, Columbia Encyclopedia and The Reader's Companion to American History]. Retrieved August 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws of this type are also found in religious cultures such as Israel, where the day concerned is Saturday rather than Sunday, and most countries with Muslim majority, where the month of [[Ramadan]] is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukinsaudiarabia.fco.gov.uk/en/help-for-british-nationals/living-in-saudi-arabia/ |title=Living in Saudi Arabia |publisher=Ukinsaudiarabia.fco.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first occurrence of the phrase ''blue law'' so far found is in the New-York Mercury of March 3, 1755, where the writer imagines a future newspaper praising the revival of &quot;our [[Connecticut]]'s old Blue Laws.&quot; In his 1781 book ''General History of Connecticut'', the Reverend [[Samuel Peters]] (1735–1826) used it to describe various laws first enacted by [[Puritan]] colonies in the 17th century that prohibited various activities, recreational as well as commercial, on [[Sunday Sabbath]] (Saturday evening through Sunday night). Sometimes the sale of certain types of merchandise was prohibited, and in some cases all retail and business activity.

Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the blue laws were originally printed on blue paper. Rather, the word ''blue'' was used in the 17th century as a disparaging reference to rigid moral codes and those who observed them, particularly in ''blue-stocking'', a reference to [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s supporters in the parliament of 1653.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, although Reverend Peters claimed that the term ''blue law'' was originally used by Puritan colonists, his work has since been found to be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/language/colors/bluelaws.htm Snopes.com: American &quot;blue laws&quot; were so named because they were originally printed on blue paper.]. Retrieved July 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, Peters never asserted that the blue laws were originally printed on blue paper, and this has come to be regarded as an example of [[false etymology]]. Another version is that the laws were first bound in books with blue covers. (See related article: [[Blue Laws (Connecticut)|Blue Laws]])

Southern and mid-western states also passed numerous laws to protect [[Sunday Sabbath]] during the mid to late 19th century. Laws targeted numerous groups including saloon owners, Jews, [[Seventh-day Adventists]], and non-religious peoples. These Sunday laws enacted at the state and local levels would sometimes carry penalties for doing non-religious activities on Sunday as part of an effort to enforce religious observance and church attendance. Numerous people were arrested for playing cards, baseball, and even fixing wagon wheels on Sunday.

Many European countries still place strong restrictions on store opening hours on Sundays, an example being [[Germany]]'s [[Ladenschlussgesetz]].

In Henry Taber's ''Faith or Fact'', he writes:
{{quote|The first observance of Sunday—that history records is in the fourth century', when [[Constantine I|Constantine]] issued an edict (not requiring its religious observance, but simply abstinence from work) reading, 'let all the judges and people of the town rest and all the various trades be suspended on the venerable day of the sun.' At the time of the issue of this edict, Constantine was a sun-worshiper; therefore it could have had no relation whatsoever to Christianity.}}

In [[Texas]], for example, blue laws prohibited selling housewares such as pots, pans, and washing machines on Sunday until 1985. In [[Colorado]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Louisiana]], [[Maine]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[Oklahoma]], [[New Jersey]], [[North Dakota]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Wisconsin]], car dealerships continue to operate under blue-law prohibitions in which an automobile may not be purchased or traded on a Sunday. [[Maryland]] permits Sunday automobile sales only in the counties of [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]], [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]], and [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]]; similarly, [[Michigan]] restricts Sunday sales to only those counties with a population of less than 130,000. [[Texas]] and [[Utah]] prohibit car dealerships from operating over consecutive weekend days. In some cases these laws were created or retained with the support of those whom they affected, to allow them a day off each week without fear of their competitors still being open.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcco.com/consumer/local_story_324235359.html Good Question: Why Can't We Buy Alcohol On Sunday?], [[WCCO-TV]], November 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states still prohibit selling [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] on Sunday, or at least before noon on Sunday, under the rationale that people should be in church on Sunday morning, or at least not drinking. At least one unusual feature of [[American culture]]—the ability to buy groceries, office supplies, and housewares from a [[drug store]]—can be traced to blue laws (under blue laws, drug stores are generally allowed to remain open on Sunday to accommodate emergency medical needs). {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Blue laws may also prohibit retail activity on days other than Sunday. In [[Massachusetts]] and [[Connecticut]], for example, blue laws dating to the [[Puritans]] of the 17th century still prohibit most retail stores, including grocery stores, from opening on Thanksgiving and Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2006/11/25/a_turkey_of_a_blue_law/ &quot;A turkey of a blue law&quot;], ''[[Boston Globe]]''.

===Georgia===
Sunday retail alcohol sales in stores were prohibited by the Georgia General Assembly up until 2011. On April 28, 2011 Georgia Governor Nathan Deal signed legislation allowing local communities to vote on whether to allow alcohol sales on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deal signs bill clearing path for Sunday sales of alcohol|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/deal-signs-bill-clearing-928440.html|accessdate=28 April 2011|newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constituion|date=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities and counties of sufficiently large populations such as most of [[Metro Atlanta]] already have Sunday alcohol sales at bars and restaurants, with local ordinances to abide by, such as having a certain amount of food sales in order to be opened and serve alcohol. Exceptions are also made by the drink at festivals and large events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.lexis-nexis.com/research/xlink?app=00075&amp;view=full&amp;searchtype=get&amp;search=O.C.G.A.+%A7+3-3-7 |title=O.C.G.A. § 3-3-7 |publisher=Web.lexis-nexis.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maine===
Maine was the last New England State to take off the books laws that prohibited department stores from opening on Sundays.  The laws against the department stores opening on Sundays were ended by referendum in 1990.  Recent efforts to overturn the laws restricting automobile dealerships from opening on Sunday have died in committee in the Maine legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Blue Laws: Blessing or Curse&quot; in ''Dealernews'', Mar. 18, 2010&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rep. Don Pilon of Saco has led the effort to get rid of the laws that prohibit automobile dealerships from opening for business on Sundays.

===Massachusetts===
Most off-premises alcohol sales were not permitted on Sundays until 2004. Exceptions were made in 1990 for municipalities that fell within 10 miles of the [[New Hampshire]] or [[Vermont]] border. Since 1992 cities and towns statewide were able to sell on Sundays from the Sunday prior to Thanksgiving to New Years Day. In both exceptions sales were not allowed before noon. Since the law changed in 2004, off-premises sales are now allowed anywhere in the state, with local approval, after noon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Jenna | last=Russell | coauthors= | title=Sunday liquor sale ban to end Romney to sign law lifting the prohibition | date=2003-11-23 | publisher=Boston Globe | url =http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2003/11/23/sunday_liquor_sale_ban_to_end/ | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-08-16 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Retail alcohol sales remain barred on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and Memorial Day.

===Michigan===
The sale of alcohol is banned from 2 a.m. to 7 a.m. Monday through Sunday. The only exception to this rule is New Year's Day, in which case alcohol sales are permitted until 4 a.m. Alcohol sale is likewise banned from on Dec. 25 from 12 a.m. until 12 p.m. Specific localities may petition for exceptions for either on-site or off-site consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(2bxbso55qufdrp45gha2mm55))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-436-2113&amp;queryid=21327957&amp;highlight=sunday%20AND%20spirits |title=MCL 436.2113 |publisher=Legislature.mi.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, vehicle sales are banned on Sunday in counties having a population of 130,000 or more.

Bergen County, part of the [[New York metropolitan area]], is home to the largest retail{{clarification needed|date=May 2011}} of any county in the nation, and home to four major malls. Due to strictly enforced laws, malls are closed on Sundays, as indeed is virtually everything except grocery stores, restaurants and movie theaters, all of which have special Sunday entrances.{{cn|date=May 2011}} The town of [[Paramus]] in Bergen County, where three of the four major malls are located in, has even more restricted blue laws than the county itself, banning all type of work on Sundays except in grocery stores and restaurants (outside malls).

===New York===
Alcohol sales for consumption off-premises are not permitted between 3 AM and 8 AM on Sundays, while on-premises sales are not permitted between 4 AM and 8 AM on any day.  Liquor stores are also required to close one day per week, on a day of the store's choosing.  Prior to 2006, off-premises alcohol sales were forbidden until noon on Sundays, and liquor/wine stores were required to be closed the entire day.  Because grocery stores are not permitted to carry wine or liquor, the older law essentially meant that only beer and alcoholic malt beverages could be purchased at all on Sundays.

Relatively few parts of New York actually permit alcohol sales at all times permissible under state law; most counties have more restrictive blue laws of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnews.com/Story_2004.cfm?ID=40448&amp;rnews_story_type=18&amp;category=10 |title=Law Permits Earlier Booze Buying |publisher=Rnews.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-21}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
The Lord's Day Act, which since 1906 had prohibited business transactions from taking place on Sundays, was struck down as unconstitutional in the 1985 case [[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.]] Calgary police officers witnessed several transactions at the Big M Drug Mart, all of which occurred on a Sunday. Big M was charged with a violation of the Lord's Day Act. A provincial court ruled that the Lord's Day Act was unconstitutional, but the Crown proceeded to appeal all the way to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. In a unanimous 6-0 decision, the Lord's Day Act was ruled an infringement of the freedom of conscience and religion defined in section 2(a) of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1985/1985canlii69/1985canlii69.html |title=CanLII - 1985 CanLII 69 (S.C.C.) |publisher=Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII.org) |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cook Islands==

In the [[Cook Islands]], blue laws were first written legislation, enacted by the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1827, with the consent of ''[[Ali'i|ariki]]'' (chiefs). In [[Tonga]], the [[Vava'u Code]] (1839) was inspired by [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[missionary]] teachings, and was a form of blue law. In [[Niue]], certain activities remain forbidden on Sunday, reflecting [[History of Niue|the country's history]] of observing Christian Sabbath tradition.

==Israel==
Running most public transportation from Friday evenings to Saturday evenings is banned in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/126959|title=Knesset Considers Law to Change Israeli Sabbath Observance&amp;nbsp;— Inside Israel&amp;nbsp;— Israel News|publisher=Israel National News|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic countries==
In most countries with an [[Islamic]] majority, people are not allowed to eat, drink, or smoke in public between dawn and dusk during the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Also, restaurants are ordered to close during the times when Muslims are fasting.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

All Muslims are also required to stop business and work when it is time for the Friday prayer events but may resume after the prayers, which normally last for 30 to 45 minutes. 

In [[Saudi Arabia]], all businesses except hospitals are made to close during [[Islamic prayers]], held five times daily.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Court cases==
The concept of a secular day of rest, not directly related to a religious day of rest, has been adduced as justification for retention of restrictions on commercial activity on Sunday.

In ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.]]'', [1985] (1 S.C.R. 295), the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Canada Supreme Court]] opined that the 1906 ''Lord's Day Act'' that required most places to be closed on Sunday did not have a legitimate [[secular]] purpose, and was an unconstitutional attempt to establish a [[religion|religious]]-based closing law in violation of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. However, the court later concluded, in [[R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd.]], [1986] (2 S.C.R. 713) that Ontario's Retail Business Holiday Act, which required some Sunday closings, did not violate the Charter because it did not have a religious purpose.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held in its landmark case, ''[[McGowan v. Maryland]]'' (1961), that [[Maryland]]'s blue laws violated neither the [[Free Exercise Clause]] nor the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. It approved the state's blue law restricting commercial activities on Sunday, noting that while such laws originated to encourage attendance at [[Christian]] churches, the contemporary Maryland laws were intended to serve &quot;to provide a uniform day of rest for all citizens&quot; on a secular basis and to promote the secular values of &quot;health, safety, recreation, and general well-being&quot; through a common day of rest. That this day coincides with [[Christian Sabbath]] is not a bar to the state's secular goals; it neither reduces its effectiveness for secular purposes nor prevents adherents of other religions from observing their own holy days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=366&amp;invol=420  McGOWAN v. MARYLAND, 366 U.S. 420 (1961)], [[Supreme Court of the United States]], Decided May 29, 1961. Accessed August 10, 2007. &quot;The present purpose and effect of most of our Sunday Closing Laws is to provide a uniform day of rest for all citizens; and the fact that this day is Sunday, a day of particular significance for the dominant Christian sects, does not bar the State from achieving its secular goals.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

There were four landmark Sunday-law cases altogether in 1961. The other three were ''[[Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc.]]'', 366 U.S. 617 (1961); ''[[Braunfeld v. Brown]]'', 366 U.S. 599 (1961); ''Two Guys from Harrison vs. McGinley'', 366 U.S. 582 (1961).&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldincrisis.org/NSLC/NSLC-9.htm The LANDMARK Cases], National Sunday Law Crisis. Accessed May 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006 Texas judges upheld the state Blue Law that requires car dealerships to close either Saturday or Sunday each weekend.&lt;ref name=&quot;kvia.com&quot;/&gt;

As almost any substance containing [[carbohydrate]]s, mainly sugars or starch, can naturally undergo fermentation, it is likely that beer-like beverages were independently invented among various cultures throughout the world.

==Brewing==
{{Main|Brewing}}
[[Image:16thCenturyBrewer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 16th-century brewery]]
The process of making beer is known as brewing. A dedicated building for the making of beer is called a [[brewery]], though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a [[brewing company]]. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as [[homebrewing]] regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in [[developed countries]], which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the USA in 1979, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homebrew4u.co.uk/news-articles/breaking-homebrewing-law-in-alabama.asp|title=Breaking the Home Brewing Law in Alabama|publisher=Homebrew4u.co.uk|date=|accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called [[wort]] and to convert the wort into the [[alcoholic beverage]] known as beer in a fermentation process effected by [[Brewer's yeast|yeast]].

{{Realale Brewing}}
The first step, where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, is known as &quot;[[mashing]]&quot;. Hot water (known as &quot;liquor&quot; in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as  &quot;[[grist]]&quot;) in a [[mash tun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abgbrew.com/brewerslog.htm] Steve Parkes, ''British Brewing'', American Brewers Guild.&lt;/ref&gt; during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in a process known as &quot;sparging&quot;. This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called ''wort separation''. The traditional process for wort separation is [[lautering]], in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhammer, Ted (2008), The Brewer's Handbook, 2nd ed., Apex, ISBN 978-0-9675212-3-7 pp. 181 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most modern breweries use a continuous sparge, collecting the original wort and the sparge water together. However, it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches. Each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer. This process is known as second (and third) runnings. Brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brewingtechniques.com/library/backissues/issue2.2/mosher.html] Randy Mosher, ''Parti-Gyle Brewing'', Brewing Techniques, March/April 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle, or &quot;copper&quot;, (so called because these vessels were traditionally made from [[copper]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2005/brewing.html |title=Copper Brewing Vessels |publisher=Msm.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and boiled, usually for about one hour. During boiling, water in the wort evaporates, but the sugars and other components of the wort remain; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer. Boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage. [[Hops]] are added during boiling as a source of bitterness, flavour and aroma. Hops may be added at more than one point during the boil. The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they contribute, but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cr9Pv0gefCQC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=hops+boiled+brewing&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U20D5Blv8GqmsNXncZ7twjbH50Zxg#PPA275,M1] Michael Lewis, Tom W. Young, ''Brewing'', page 275, Springer (2002), ISBN 0-306-47274-0&lt;/ref&gt;

After boiling, the hopped wort is now cooled, ready for the yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the [[brewers yeast|yeast]] is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing alcohol, fine [[Particulate|particulate matter]] suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beer-brewing.com/apex/beer_chapters/ch06_beer_adjuncts.htm beer-brewing.com] Ted Goldammer, ''The Brewers Handbook'', Chapter 13 – Beer Fermentation, Apex Pub (1 January 2000), ISBN 0-9675212-0-3.

Fermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of [[Brewing#Secondary fermentation|secondary fermentation]]. Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cr9Pv0gefCQC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=secondary+fermentation+brewing&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3T7G6RMyj_w9QtnLY9ZeANNuSshQ Google Books] Michael Lewis, Tom W.

Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the [[grain bill]].

;Water
Beer is composed mostly of water. Regions have water with different mineral components; as a result, different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer, thus giving them a regional character.&lt;ref name=&quot;geot&quot;/&gt; For example, [[Dublin]] has [[hard water]] well suited to making [[stout]], such as [[Guinness]]; while [[Pilzen]] has soft water well suited to making [[pale lager]], such as [[Pilsner Urquell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;geot&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/aug04/resources.html|title=Geology and Beer|work=Geotimes|date=2004-08|accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waters of [[Burton Bridge Brewery|Burton]] in England contain [[gypsum]], which benefits making [[pale ale]] to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as [[Burtonisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000098.html] Michael Jackson, BeerHunter, 19 October 1991, ''Brewing a good glass of water''. Retrieved 13 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Starch source
{{Main|Malt|Mash ingredients}}
The starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin [[germination]], and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:en:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Brewing/Chemistry|Wikisource]] 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Brewing/Chemistry. Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farm-direct.co.uk/farming/stockcrop/barley/malt.html Farm-direct] Oz, ''Barley Malt'', 6 February 2002. Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch. This is because of its fibrous husk, which is not only important in the sparging stage of brewing (in which water is washed over the [[Mashing|mashed]] barley grains to form the [[wort]]), but also as a rich source of [[amylase]], a [[digestion|digestive]] [[enzyme]] which facilitates conversion of starch into sugars. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and [[rye]], and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. In recent years, a few brewers have produced [[gluten-free beer]] made with sorghum with no barley malt for those who cannot consume [[gluten]]-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.&lt;ref&gt;

The flowers themselves are often called &quot;hops&quot;.

Hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer. Hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt; the bitterness of beers is measured on the [[International Bitterness Units scale]].

At these temperatures, yeast produces significant amounts of [[ester]]s and other secondary flavour and aroma products, and the result is often a beer with slightly &quot;fruity&quot; compounds resembling apple, pear, pineapple, banana, plum, or prune, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.co.uk/books?id=allg4XxlOM4C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=beer+fruity+esters&amp;sig=ACfU3U3y2dmIwcGJCI9sZPpXzWfNHax3Vg Google Books] Lalli Nykänen, Heikki Suomalainen, ''Aroma of Beer, Wine and Distilled Alcoholic Beverages'' pp 13, Springer (1983), ISBN 90-277-1553-X&lt;/ref&gt;

;Pale Ale
{{Main|Pale Ale}}
[[Image:Pale Ale.jpg|right|thumb|A glass of Pale Ale]]
Pale ale is a beer which uses a [[top-fermenting yeast]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beer-pages.com/protz/features/ipa.htm |title=Roger Protz on India Pale ale |publisher=www.beer-pages.com |accessdate=2010-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and predominantly pale malt. It is one of the world's major [[beer style]]s.

;Stout
[[Stout]] and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley, and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast. There are a number of variations including Baltic porter, dry stout, and Imperial stout. The name Porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=180680 |title=Porter and Stout – CAMRA |publisher=www.camra.org.uk |accessdate=24 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This same beer later also became known as stout, though the word stout had been used as early as 1677.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0937381446?p=S003#reader-page Amazon Online Reader : Stout (Classic Beer Style Series, 10)]&lt;/ref&gt; The history and development of stout and porter are intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000041.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter – Porter casts a long shadow on ale history |publisher=www.beerhunter.com |accessdate=24 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Mild
{{Main|Mild ale}}

Mild ale has a predominantly malty palate. It is usually dark coloured with an [[Alcohol by volume|abv]] of 3% to 3.6%, although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching 6% abv and higher.

;Wheat
[[Wheat beer]] is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of [[malted barley]]. Wheat beers are usually [[top-fermented]] (in Germany they have to be by law).&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;&gt;Eric Warner, ''German Wheat Beer.'' Boulder, CO: Brewers Publications, 1992. ISBN 978-0-937381-34-2&lt;/ref&gt; The flavour of wheat beers varies considerably, depending upon the specific style.

;Lager
{{Main|Lager}}
[[Lager]] is the English name for cool fermenting beers of Central European origin. [[Pale lager]]s are the most commonly consumed beers in the world. The name &quot;lager&quot; comes from the German &quot;lagern&quot; for &quot;to store&quot;, as brewers around Bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months. These brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment, and to also clear of sediment, when stored in cool conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000255.html] Michael Jackson, BeerHunter, ''The birth of lager'', 1 March 1996. Retrieved 16 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lager yeast is a cool bottom-fermenting yeast (''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'') and typically undergoes primary fermentation at {{convert|7|–|12|C|F}} (the fermentation phase), and then is given a long secondary fermentation at {{convert|0|–|4|C|F}} (the lagering phase). During the secondary stage, the lager clears and mellows. The cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of [[ester]]s and other byproducts, resulting in a &quot;cleaner&quot;-tasting beer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-09/cshl-bbb090308.php] Gavin Sherlock, Ph.D., EurekAlert, ''Brewing better beer: Scientists determine the genomic origins of lager yeasts'', 10 September 2008. Retrieved 16 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by Gabriel Sedlmayr the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the [[Spaten Brewery]] in [[Bavaria]], and [[Anton Dreher]], who began brewing a lager (now known as [[Vienna lager]]), probably of amber-red colour, in [[Vienna]] in 1840–1841. With improved modern yeast strains, most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage, typically 1–3 weeks.

;Lambic
[[Lambic]], a beer of [[Belgian beers|Belgium]], is naturally fermented using wild yeasts, rather than cultivated. Many of these are not strains of brewer's yeast (''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'') and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness. Yeast varieties such as ''[[Brettanomyces bruxellensis]]'' and ''[[Brettanomyces lambicus]]'' are common in lambics. In addition, other organisms such as ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Tim; Pollard, Chris; and Pattyn, Joris; ''Lambicland: Lambikland'', Rev Ed. (Cogan and Mater Ltd, 2004), ISBN 0-9547789-0-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{Main|Beer measurement}}
Beer is measured and assessed by bitterness, by strength and by colour. The perceived [[bitter (taste)|bitterness]] is measured by the International Bitterness Units scale (IBU), defined in co-operation between the [[American Society of Brewing Chemists]] and the [[European Brewery Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''Pale lager'' and ''pale ale'' are terms used for beers made from malt dried with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. Coke was first used for roasting malt in 1642, but it was not until around 1703 that the term ''pale ale'' was used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer-News/Article-579.htm British Bitter] ''A beer style or a way of life?'', RateBeer (January 2006).

In terms of sales volume, most of today's beer is based on the pale lager brewed in 1842 in the town of [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] in the present-day [[Czech beer|Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000262.html BeerHunter] Michael Jackson, ''A Czech-style classic from Belgium'', Beer Hunter Online (7 September 1999). Retrieved 20 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern pale lager is light in colour with a noticeable carbonation (fizzy bubbles) and a typical [[alcohol by volume]] content of around 5%. The [[Pilsner Urquell]], [[Bitburger]], and [[Heineken Pilsener|Heineken]] brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager, as are the American brands [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]], and [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]].

Dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers. Very dark beers, such as [[stout]], use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer.

The alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation. The quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer. Additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content, and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer (primarily &quot;light&quot; beers) to convert more complex carbohydrates (starches) to fermentable sugars. Alcohol is a by-product of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast; typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above 12% by volume. Low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content.

==Serving==
=== Draught ===
{{Main|Draught beer|Keg beer|Cask ale}}
[[Image:Keg Fonts.jpg|right|thumb|Draught beer keg fonts at the [[Délirium Café]] in [[Brussels]]]]
'''Draught beer''' from a pressurised [[keg]] is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing [[beer tap|tap]] or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. [[Nitrogen]] produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense [[Beer head|head]] and a creamy [[mouthfeel]]. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called [[beer ball]]s.

In the 1980s, Guinness introduced the [[Widget (beer)|beer widget]], a nitrogen-pressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense, tight head, similar to beer served from a nitrogen system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/question446.htm|title=How does the widget in a beer can work?|publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]]|accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''draft'' and ''draught'' can be used as marketing terms to describe canned or [[beer bottle|bottled]] beers containing a beer widget, or which are cold-filtered rather than pasteurised.

[[Image:Cask Ales.jpg|thumb|left|A selection of [[cask beer]]s]]
Cask-conditioned ales (or cask ales) are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers. These beers are termed &quot;[[real ale]]&quot; by the [[CAMRA]] organisation. Typically, when a cask arrives in a pub, it is placed horizontally on a frame called a &quot;[[stillage]]&quot; which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle, and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature (typically between {{convert|11|-|13|C|F|disp=s}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cask-marque.co.uk/Consumer/temperature-of-beer.html |title=Beer Temperature | Consumer |publisher=www.cask-marque.co.uk |accessdate=2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a (usually rubber) bung at the bottom of one end, and a hard [[spile]] or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask, which is now uppermost. The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to &quot;drop&quot; (clear) again, as well as to fully condition—this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days. At this point the beer is ready to sell, either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump, or simply being &quot;gravity-fed&quot; directly into the glass.

Draught beer's environmental impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Packaging===
{{Main|Beer bottle|Beverage can}}
Most beers are cleared of yeast by [[filtered beer|filtering]] when packaged in bottles and cans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-FviAgcmo90C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=beer+classification+ale+lager&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0GLvHLLvTVL_knmgkSWkPt3iz_eA#PPA58,M1 Google books]  Charles W. Bamforth, ''Beer: Tap Into the Art and Science of Brewing'' pp58-59, Oxford University Press US (2003), ISBN 0-19-515479-7. Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[bottle conditioning|bottle conditioned]] beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GG-60Vtl81EC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=beer+bottle+conditioned&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3zLu6ExkPefZvEj5NVqZxQFH3kcQ Google Books] T. Boekhout, Vincent Robert, ''Yeasts in Food: Beneficial and Detrimental Aspects''  pp370-371, Behr's Verlag DE (2003), ISBN 3-86022-961-3. Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with [[wheat beer]]s. Typically, when serving a [[hefeweizen]], 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.

Many beers are sold in cans, though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries. In Sweden in 2001, 63.9% of beer was sold in cans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = European Beer Statistics—beer sales by package type | publisher = European Beer Guide | url = http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/eustats.htm#package | accessdate =5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; People either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass. Cans protect the beer from light (thereby preventing [[Skunked beer|&quot;skunked&quot;]] beer) and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles. Cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer, then became commonly associated with less expensive, mass-produced beers, even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutbeer.com/features/packaging.html|title=Beer Packaging Secrets|publisher=All About Beer Magazine|accessdate=5 November 2007|quote=From a quality point of view, cans are much like bottles. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928060803/http://www.allaboutbeer.com/features/packaging.html |archivedate = September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic ([[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]]) bottles are used by some breweries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.packaging-gateway.com/projects/holsten/|title=Holsten-Brauerei Pet Line for Bottled Beer, Brunswick, Germany|publisher=Packaging-Gateway.com|accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature===
[[Image:Edouard Manet 006.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Édouard Manet]]'s ''The Waitress'' showing a woman serving beer]]
The [[temperature]] of a beer has an influence on a drinker's experience; warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing. Most drinkers prefer [[pale lager]] to be served chilled, a low- or medium-strength [[pale ale]] to be served cool, while a strong [[barley wine]] or [[imperial stout]] to be served at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realbeer.com/library/beerbreak/archives/beerbreak20000921.php RealBeer] ''Beyond the coldest beer in town'', 21 September 2000. Retrieved 11 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beer writer [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]] proposed a five-level scale for serving temperatures: well chilled ({{convert|7|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=s}}) for &quot;light&quot; beers (pale lagers); chilled ({{convert|8|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=s}}) for [[Berliner Weisse]] and other wheat beers; lightly chilled ({{convert|9|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=s}}) for all dark lagers, [[altbier]] and German wheat beers; cellar temperature ({{convert|13|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=s}}) for regular British [[ale]], [[stout]] and most [[Belgian beer|Belgian specialities]]; and room temperature ({{convert|15.5|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=s}}) for strong dark ales (especially [[trappist beer]]) and [[barley wine]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jackson, ''Michael Jackson's Beer Companion'', Courage Books; 2 edition (27 February 2000), ISBN 0-7624-0772-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Drinking chilled beer began with the development of artificial [[refrigeration]] and by the 1870s, was spread in those countries that concentrated on brewing pale lager.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BuzNzm-x0l8C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=history+of+lager+refrigeration&amp;source=web&amp;ots=zuaFlbk79s&amp;sig=aMrrvuq_XFnoXl8VjnOHBVIJtbY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result Google Books] Jack S.

===Vessels===
{{Main|Beer glassware}}
Beer is consumed out of a variety of vessels, such as a glass, a [[beer stein]], a mug, a [[pewter]] [[tankard]], a beer bottle or a can. The shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style.&lt;ref&gt;F. G. Priest, Graham G. Stewart, ''Handbook of brewing‎'' (2006), 48&lt;/ref&gt; Breweries offer [[brand]]ed glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepublican.com/story.asp?storycode=64595 |title=The Publican – Home – Beer Matters: How Miller Brands partners with licensees to drive sales |publisher=www.thepublican.com |accessdate=17 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pouring process has an influence on a beer's presentation. The rate of flow from the [[beer tap|tap]] or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and [[turbulence]] of the beer and its release of [[carbonation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xnLeJAPYzGkC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=pouring+beer&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2vCrDBPoQzAIFMN2gjtxKYYQZW3Q Google Books] Ray Foley, Heather Dismore, ''Running a Bar For Dummies'' pp 211–212, For Dummies (2007), ISBN 0-470-04919-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beer and society==
[[Image:Oktoberfest2.jpg|thumb|right|A tent at Munich's [[Oktoberfest]]—the world's largest beer festival]]
{{See also|Category:Beer culture}}

In most societies, beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage.

Various social traditions and activities are associated with beer drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending [[beer festival]]s; visiting a [[pub crawl|series of pubs]] in one evening; joining an organisation such as [[CAMRA]]; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or [[rating beer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Leslie Dunkling]] &amp; Michael Jackson, ''The Guinness Drinking Companion'', Lyons Press (2003), ISBN 158574617&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drinking game]]s, such as [[beer pong]], are also popular.&lt;ref&gt;''Best Drinking Game Book Ever'', Carlton Books (28 October 2002), ISBN 1-85868-560-5&lt;/ref&gt; A relatively new profession is that of the [[beer sommelier]], who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.

Beer is considered to be a social lubricant in many societies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQE/is_5_12/ai_76964204| title=Beer Boss | first=Michael | last=Sherer | work=Cheers | publisher=findarticles.com | date=2001–06 | accessdate=14 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is [[Beer consumption by country|consumed in countries]] all over the world. There are breweries in Middle Eastern countries such as [[Beer in Iran|Iran]] and [[Beer in Syria|Syria]], and in [[Beer in Africa|African countries]].

A 2005 Japanese study found that [[low alcohol beer]] may possess strong anti-cancer properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Non-alcoholic beer may help mice fight cancer | date=21 January 2005 | publisher=Reuters | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6853732/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found nonalcoholic beer to mirror the cardiovascular benefits associated with moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Double benefit from alcohol-free beer | date=17 May 2005 | publisher=Food Navigator | url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/news/ng.asp?id=52157-double-benefit-from }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, much research suggests that the primary health benefit from alcoholic beverages comes from the alcohol they contain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Edell|first=Dean|title=Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness|year=2004|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered that overeating and lack of muscle tone is the main cause of a [[beer belly]], rather than beer consumption. A recent study, however, found a link between [[binge drinking]] and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|the unit of information}}
{{Refimprove|date=August 2010}}
{{Fundamental info units}}
A '''bit''' (a contraction of '''binary digit''') is the basic unit of [[information]] in [[computing]] and [[telecommunication]]s; it is the amount of information stored by a digital device or other physical system that exists in one of two possible distinct [[state (computer science)|states]].  These may be the two stable states of a [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], two positions of an [[electrical switch]], two distinct [[voltage]] or [[electric current|current]] levels allowed by a [[electrical circuit|circuit]], two distinct levels of [[Irradiance|light intensity]], two directions of [[magnetism|magnetization]] or [[electrical polarity|polarization]], etc.

In [[computing]], a bit can also be defined as a [[variable (computer science)|variable]] or computed quantity that can have only two possible [[value (computer science)|values]].  These two values are often interpreted as [[binary notation|binary digits]] and are usually denoted by the Arabic [[numerical digit]]s 0 and&amp;nbsp;1.  Indeed, the term &quot;bit&quot; is a contraction of ''binary digit''.  The two values can also be interpreted as [[Truth value|logical values]] (''true''/''false'', ''yes''/''no''), algebraic [[signed number|signs]] (''+''/''&amp;minus;''), activation states (''on''/''off''), or any other two-valued attribute.   The correspondence between these values and the physical states of the underlying [[Data storage device|storage]] or [[computing device|device]] is a matter of convention, and different assignments may be used even within the same device or [[computer program|program]].   The length of a binary number may be referred to as its &quot;&quot;[[bit-length]].&quot;

In [[information theory]], one bit is typically defined as the uncertainty of a binary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability,&lt;ref&gt;John B. Anderson, Rolf Johnnesson (2006) ''Understanding Information Transmission''.&lt;/ref&gt; or the information that is gained when the value of such a variable becomes known.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Haykin (2006), ''Digital Communications''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum computing]], a ''quantum bit'' or ''[[qubit]]'' is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum system]] that can exist in [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of two bit values, &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;. 

The symbol for bit, as a unit of information, is either simply &quot;bit&quot; (recommended by the [[ISO/IEC 80000|ISO/IEC standard 80000-13 (2008)]]) or lowercase &quot;b&quot; (recommended by the [[IEEE 1541-2002|IEEE 1541 Standard (2002)]]).

==History==
The encoding of data by discrete bits was used in the [[punched card]]s invented by [[Basile Bouchon]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Falcon]] (1732), developed by [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] (1804), and later adopted by [[Semen Korsakov]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[Hermann Hollerith]], and early computer manufacturers like [[IBM]].  Another variant of that idea was the perforated [[paper tape]].  In all those systems, the medium (card or tape) conceptually carried an array of hole positions; each position could be either punched through or not, thus potentially carrying one bit of information.  The encoding of text by bits was also used in [[Morse code]] (1844) and early digital communications machines such as [[teletype]]s and [[stock ticker machine]]s (1870).

[[Ralph Hartley]] suggested the use of a logarithmic measure of information in 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;abramson&quot;&gt;Norman Abramson (1963), ''Information theory and coding''. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Claude E. Shannon]] first used the word '''''bit''''' in his seminal 1948 paper ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]''. He attributed its origin to [[John W. Tukey]], who had written a Bell Labs memo on 9 January 1947 in which he contracted &quot;binary digit&quot; to simply &quot;bit&quot;.  Interestingly, [[Vannevar Bush]] had written in 1936 of &quot;bits of information&quot; that could be stored on the [[punched card]]s used in the mechanical computers of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Vannevar Bush, ''[http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183499313 Instrumental Analysis]'', Bull. Amer. Math. Soc., vol. 42, no. 10, pp. 649-669, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first programmable computer built by [[Konrad Zuse]] used binary notation for numbers.

==Representation==&lt;!-- Warning: this heading is the target of a link in [[Flip-flop (electronics)]] --&gt;

===Transmission and processing===
Bits can be implemented in many forms. In most modern computing devices, a bit is usually represented by an [[electric]]al [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] pulse, or by the electrical state of a [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop circuit]]. For devices using [[positive logic]], a digit value of 1 (true value or high) is represented by a positive voltage relative to the [[electrical ground]] voltage (up to 5 [[volt]]s in the case of [[transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] designs), while a digit value of 0 (false value or low) is represented by 0 volts.

===Storage===
In the earliest non-electronic information processing devices, such as Jacquard's loom or Babbage's [[Analytical Engine]], a bit was often stored as the position of a mechanical lever or gear, or the presence or absence of a hole at a specific point of a paper card or tape.  The first electrical  devices for discrete logic (such as [[elevator]] and [[traffic light]] control circuits, [[telephone switches]], and Konrad Zuse's computer) represents bits as the states of [[electrical relay]]s which could be either &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot;.  When relays were replaced by [[vacuum tube]]s, starting in the 1940s, computer builders experimented with a variety of storage methods, such as pressure pulses traveling down a [[mercury delay line]], charges stored on the inside surface of a [[cathode-ray tube]], or opaque spots printed on [[optical disc|glass discs]] by [[photolithographic]] techniques .

In the 1950s and 1960s these methods were largely supplanted by [[magnetic storage]] devices such as [[magnetic core memory]], [[magnetic tape]]s, [[magnetic drum|drum]]s, and [[Disk storage|disk]]s, where a bit was represented by the polarity of [[magnetism|magnetization]] of a certain area of a [[ferromagnetic]] film.  The same principle was later used in the [[magnetic bubble memory]] developed in the 1980s, and is still found in various [[magnetic strip]] items such as [[Rapid transit|metro]] tickets and some [[credit card]]s. 

In modern [[semiconductor memory]], such as [[dynamic random access memory]] or [[flash memory]], the two values of a bit may be represented by two levels of [[electrical charge]] stored in a [[capacitor]].  In [[programmable logic array]]s and certain types of [[read-only memory]], a bit may be represented by the presence or absence of a conducting path at a certain point of a circuit.  In [[optical disc]]s, a bit is encoded as the presence or absence of a microscopic pit on a reflective surface.  In one-dimensional [[bar code]]s, bits are encoded as the thickness of alternating black and white lines.

==Information capacity and information content==
Information ''capacity'' of a storage system is only an upper bound to the actual ''quantity of information'' stored therein.  If the two possible values of one bit of storage are not equally likely, that bit of storage will contain less than one bit of information.  Indeed, if the value is completely predictable, then the reading of that value will provide no information at all (zero bits).  If a computer file that uses ''n'' bits of storage contains only ''m'' &lt; ''n'' bits of information, then that information can in principle be encoded in about ''m'' bits, at least on the average.  This principle is the basis of [[lossless data compression|data compression]] technology.  Sometimes the name ''bit'' is used when discussing data storage while ''shannon'' is used for the statistical bit.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Multiple bits==
{{Quantities of bits}}
There are several [[units of information]] which are defined as multiples of bits, such as [[byte]] (8 bits), [[kilobit]] (either 1000 or 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 1024 bits), [[megabyte]] (either {{gaps|8|000|000}} or 8×2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; = {{gaps|8|388|608|bits}}), etc. 

Computers usually manipulate bits in groups of a fixed size, conventionally named &quot;[[Word (data type)|word]]s&quot;. The number of bits in a word varies with the computer model; typically between 8 to 80 bits; or even more in some specialized machines.

The [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'s standard [[IEC 60027]] specifies that the symbol for binary digit should be &quot;bit&quot;, and this should be used in all multiples, such as &quot;kbit&quot; (for kilobit).&lt;ref name=&quot;nist&quot;&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology (2008), ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units''. [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf Online version.]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the letter &quot;b&quot; (in lower case) is widely used too.  The letter &quot;B&quot; (upper case) is both the standard and customary symbol for byte. 

In telecommunications (including [[computer network]]s), data transfer rates are usually measured in [[bit per second|bits per second]] (bit/s) or its multiples, such as kbit/s. (This unit is not to be confused with [[baud]].)

==Bit-based computing==
Certain [[bitwise operation|bitwise]] computer [[central processing unit|processor]] instructions (such as ''bit set'') operate at the level of manipulating bits rather than manipulating data interpreted as an aggregate of bits.  

In the 1980s, when [[bitmap]]ped computer displays became popular, some computers provided specialized [[bitblt|bit block transfer]] (&quot;bitblt&quot; or &quot;blit&quot;) instructions to set or copy the bits that corresponded to a given rectangular area on the screen.

In most computers and programming languages, when a bit within a group of bits such as a byte or word is to be referred to, it is usually specified by a number from 0 (not 1) upwards corresponding to its position within the byte or word.  However, 0 can refer to either the [[most significant bit]] or to the [[least significant bit]] depending on the context, so the convention of use must be known.

==Other information units==
{{Main|Units of information}}
Other units of information, sometimes used in information theory, include the ''natural digit'' also called a ''[[nat (information)|nat]]'' or ''nit'' and defined as [[logarithm|log]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''e'' (≈ 1.443) bits, where ''e'' is the [[e (mathematical constant)|base of the natural logarithms]]; and the ''dit'', ''[[ban (information)|ban]]'', or ''Hartley'', defined as log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;10 (≈ 3.322) bits.&lt;ref name=&quot;abramson&quot;/&gt; Conversely, one bit of information corresponds to about [[natural logarithm|ln]] 2 (≈ 0.693) nats, or log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; 2 (≈ 0.301) Hartleys.  Some authors also define a '''binit''' as an arbitrary information unit equivalent to some fixed but unspecified number of bits.&lt;ref&gt;Amitabha Bhattacharya, ''Digital Communication''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''byte''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|aɪ|t}}), is a [[units of information|unit of digital information]] in [[computing]] and [[telecommunications]], that most commonly consists of eight [[bit]]s. Historically, a byte was the number of bits used to encode a single [[character (computing)|character]] of text in a computer&lt;ref name = Bemer1962&gt;{{citation

The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards exist that mandate the size. The [[de facto standard|''de facto'' standard]] of eight bits is a convenient [[power of two]] permitting the values 0 through 255 for one byte.  Many types of applications use variables representable in eight or fewer bits, and processor designers optimize for this common usage. The popularity of major commercial computing architectures have aided in the ubiquitous acceptance of the 8-bit size.
The term [[Octet (computing)|octet]] was defined to explicitly denote a sequence of 8 bits because of the ambiguity associated with the term byte.

==History==
The term ''byte'' was coined by Dr. [[Werner Buchholz]] in July 1956, during the early design phase for the [[IBM 7030|IBM Stretch]] computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/IBM/Stretch/102636400.txt|title= Timeline of the IBM Stretch/Harvest era (1956–1961) | publisher = Computer History | date=July 1956|author=Werner Buchholz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/B/byte.html|title=byte definition}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a respelling of ''bite'' to avoid accidental mutation to ''bit''.&lt;ref name=Bemer1962/&gt;

Early computers were designed for 4-bit BCD code ([[binary coded decimal]]) or 6-bit code for printable &quot;graphic set&quot;, which included 26 alphabetic characters (only uppercase), 10 Numerical digits, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include the control characters and allow digital devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language, and lowercase characters, a 7-bit [[ASCII]] code was introduced (see [[ASCII]] history).  Since with just only one bit more an eight bits allows two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary coded decimal, the eight-bit [[EBCDIC]] (see [[EBCDIC]] history) character encoding was later adopted and promulgated as a standard by the IBM in the [[System/360]], the preset byte.

The size of a byte was at first selected to be a multiple of existing teletypewriter codes, particularly the [[Sixbit|6-bit codes]] used by the [[U.S. Army]] ([[Fieldata]]) and Navy.

In 1963, to end the use of incompatible teleprinter codes by different branches of the U.S. government, [[ASCII]], a 7-bit code, was adopted as a [[Federal Information Processing Standard]], making 6-bit bytes commercially obsolete. In the early 1960s, AT&amp;T introduced [[digital telephony]] first on long-distance [[trunk line]]s.  These used the 8-bit [[µ-law algorithm|µ-law encoding]].  This large investment promised to reduce transmission costs for 8-bit data.  The use of 8-bit codes for digital telephony also caused 8-bit data &quot;octets&quot; to be adopted as the basic data unit of the early [[Internet]].  

In the late 1970s, microprocessors such as the [[Intel 8008]] (the direct predecessor of  the [[Intel 8080|8080]], and then the [[Intel 8086|8086]] used in early PCs) could perform a small number of operations on [[4bit| four bits]], such as the DAA (decimal adjust) instruction, and the ''half carry'' flag, which were used to implement decimal arithmetic routines. These four-bit quantities were called [[nibble]]s, in homage to the then-common 8-bit bytes.

Reasons for the ubiquity of the eight-bit byte include the popularity of the IBM [[System/360]] architecture, introduced in the 1960s, and the [[8-bit]] [[microprocessor]]s, introduced in the 1970s.

The term [[Octet (computing)|octet]] is used to unambiguously specify a size of eight bits, and is used extensively in [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] definitions, for example.

==Unit symbol==
{{Bit and byte prefixes}}
The unit symbol for the byte is specified in [[IEEE 1541]] and the Metric Interchange Format&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/MIXF Metric-Interchange-Format]&lt;/ref&gt; as the upper-case character B, while other standards, such as the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) standard [[IEC 60027]], appear silent on the subject.

In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), B is the symbol of the [[Decibel|bel]], a unit of logarithmic power ratios named after [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. The usage of B for byte therefore conflicts with this definition. It is also not consistent with the SI convention that only units named after persons should be capitalized. However, there is little danger of confusion because the bel is a rarely used unit. It is used primarily in its decadic fraction, the [[decibel]] (dB), for [[signal strength]] and [[sound pressure level]] measurements, while a unit for one tenth of a byte, i.e. the decibyte, is never used.

The unit symbol kB is commonly used for [[kilobyte]], but may be confused with the common meaning of kb for [[kilobit]]. IEEE 1541 specifies the lower case character b as the symbol for [[bit]]; however, the IEC 60027 and Metric-Interchange-Format specify bit (e.g., Mbit for megabit) for the symbol, a sufficient disambiguation from byte.

The lowercase letter o for [[Octet (computing)|octet]] is a commonly used symbol in several non-English languages (e.g., [[French language|French]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iec.ch/zone/si/si_bytes.htm |title=When is a kilobyte a kibibyte? And an MB an MiB? | date= |work=The International System of Units and the IEC |publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] |accessdate=August 30, 2010}})&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]), and is also used with metric prefixes (for example, ''ko'' and ''Mo'')

Today the harmonized [[ISO]]/IEC [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-13:2008 – Quantities and units — Part 13: Information science and technology]] standard cancels and replaces subclauses 3.8 and 3.9 of IEC 60027-2:2005, namely those related to Information theory and Prefixes for binary multiples.

==Unit multiples==
[[Image:Binaryvdecimal.svg|thumb|right|175px|Percentage difference between decimal and binary interpretations of the unit prefixes grows with increasing storage size.]]
{{See also|Binary prefix}}
There has been considerable confusion about the meanings of [[SI prefix|SI (or metric) prefixes]] used with the unit byte, especially concerning prefixes such as kilo (k or K) and mega (M) as shown in the chart ''Prefixes for bit and byte''. Since computer memory is designed with binary logic, multiples are expressed in [[power of two|powers of 2]], rather than 10. The software and computer industries often use binary estimates of the SI-prefixed quantities, while producers of computer storage devices prefer the SI values.  This is the reason for specifying computer hard drive capacities of, say, 100 GB, when it contains 93 GiB of storage space.

While the numerical difference between the decimal and binary interpretations is small for the prefixes kilo and mega, it grows to over 20% for prefix yotta, illustrated in the linear-log graph (at right) of difference versus storage size.

==Common uses==
The byte is also defined as a [[data type]] in certain [[programming language]]s. The [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] programming languages, for example, define ''byte'' as an &quot;''addressable unit of data large enough to hold any member of the basic character set of the execution environment''&quot; (clause 3.6 of the C standard). The C standard requires that the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; integral data type is capable of holding at least 255 different values, and is represented by at least 8 bits (clause 5.2.4.2.1). Various implementations of C and C++ reserve 8, 9, 16, 32, or 36 bits for the storage of a byte.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/intrinsic-types.html#faq-26.4 [26&amp;#93; Built-in / intrinsic / primitive data types, C++ FAQ Lite&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.att.net/~jackklein/c/inttypes.html#char Integer Types In C and C++]&lt;/ref&gt; The actual number of bits in a particular implementation is documented as &lt;code&gt;CHAR_BIT&lt;/code&gt; as implemented in the &lt;code&gt;[[limits.h]]&lt;/code&gt; file. [[Java (programming language)|Java's]] primitive &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; data type is always defined as consisting of 8 bits and being a signed data type, holding values from −128 to 127.

In data transmission systems, a contiguous sequence of binary bits in a serial data stream, such as in modem or satellite communications, which is the smallest meaningful unit of data. These bytes might include start bits, stop bits, or parity bits, and thus could vary from 7 to 12 bits to contain a single 7-bit ASCII code.

'''Boron nitride''' is a [[chemical compound]] with [[chemical formula]] BN, consisting of equal numbers of [[boron]] and [[nitrogen]] atoms. BN is [[isoelectronic]] to a similarly structured [[carbon]] lattice and thus exists in various [[Polymorphism (materials science)|crystalline forms]]. The [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal form]] corresponding to [[graphite]] is the most stable and softest among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic ([[Zincblende (crystal structure)#Zincblende structure|sphalerite structure]]) variety analogous to [[diamond]] is called c-BN. Its hardness is inferior only to diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare [[Wurtzite crystal structure|wurtzite]] BN modification is similar to [[lonsdaleite]] and may even be harder than the cubic form. 

Boron nitride is not found in nature and is therefore produced synthetically from [[boric acid]] or [[boron trioxide]]. The initial product is amorphous BN powder, which is converted to crystalline h-BN by heating in nitrogen flow at temperatures above 1500&amp;nbsp;°C. c-BN is made by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] h-BN powder at higher temperatures, under pressures above 5 GPa. Contrary to diamond, larger c-BN pellets can be produced by fusing ([[sintering]]) relatively cheap c-BN powders. As a result, c-BN is widely used in mechanical applications. 

Because of excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride has a great potential in nanotechnology. Nanotubes of BN can be produced that have a structure similar to that of [[carbon nanotube]]s, i.e. graphene (or BN) sheets rolled on themselves, however the properties are very different: whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the rolling direction and radius, a BN nanotube is an electrical insulator with a wide bandgap of ~5.5 eV (same as in diamond), which is almost independent of tube chirality and morphology. Similar to other BN forms, BN nanotubes are more thermally and chemically stable than carbon nanotubes which favors them for some applications.

==Structure==
Boron nitride has been produced in an amorphous (a-BN) and crystalline forms. The most stable crystalline form is the hexagonal one, also called h-BN, α-BN, or g-BN (graphitic BN). It has a layered structure similar to graphite. Within each layer, boron and nitrogen atoms are bound by strong [[covalent bond]]s, whereas the layers are held together by weak [[van der Waals force]]s. The interlayer &quot;registry&quot; of these sheets differs, however, from the pattern seen for graphite, because the atoms are eclipsed, with boron atoms lying over and above nitrogen atoms. This registry reflects the polarity of the B-N bonds. Still, h-BN and graphite are very close neighbors and even the BC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N hybrids have been synthesized where carbon substitutes for some B and N atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =M. Kawaguchi| title = Electronic structure and intercalation chemistry of graphite-like layered material with a composition of BC6N|journal = Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids| volume = 69 |year= 2008 |page = 1171| doi = 10.1016/j.jpcs.2007.10.076|last2 =Kuroda|first2 =Shinya|last3 =Muramatsu|first3 =Yasuji|issue =5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As diamond is less stable than graphite, cubic BN is less stable than h-BN, but the conversion rate between those forms is negligible at room temperature. The cubic form has the sphalerite crystal structure, same as diamond structure, and is also called β-BN or c-BN. The [[Wurtzite crystal structure|wurtzite]] BN form (w-BN) has similar structure as lonsdaleite, rare hexagonal polymorph of carbon. In both c-BN and w-BN boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into [[tetrahedra]], but the angles between neighboring tetrahedra are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = M. S.

The partly [[ionic bond|ionic]] structure of BN layers in h-BN reduces covalency and electrical conductivity, whereas the interlayer interaction increases resulting in higher hardness of h-BN relative to graphite. The reduced electron-delocalization in hexagonal-BN is also indicated by its absence of color and a large [[band gap]]. Very different bonding – strong covalent within the [[basal plane]]s (planes where boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded) and weak between them – causes high [[anisotropy]] of most properties of h-BN.

For example, the hardness, electrical and thermal conductivity are much higher within the planes than perpendicular to them. On the contrary, the properties of c-BN and w-BN are more homogeneous. 

Those materials are extremely hard, with the hardness of c-BN being slightly smaller and w-BN even higher than that of diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Z.

===Thermal stability===
Hexagonal and cubic (and probably w-BN) BN show remarkable chemical and thermal stabilities. For example, h-BN is stable to decomposition in temperatures up to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C in air, 1400&amp;nbsp;°C in vacuum, and 2800&amp;nbsp;°C in an inert atmosphere. The reactivity of h-BN and c-BN is relatively similar, and the data for c-BN are summarized in the table below.

Thermal stability of c-BN can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;
*In air or oxygen: B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; protective layer prevents further oxidation to ~1300&amp;nbsp;°C; no conversion to hexagonal form at 1400&amp;nbsp;°C.
*In nitrogen: some conversion to h-BN at 1525&amp;nbsp;°C after 12 h.
*In vacuum (10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; Pa): conversion to h-BN at 1550 – 1600&amp;nbsp;°C.

===Chemical stability===
Boron nitride is insoluble in usual acids, but is soluble in alkaline molten salts and nitrides, such as LiOH, KOH, NaOH-Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N, Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Ba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which are therefore used to etch BN.&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

===Thermal conductivity===
The theoretical thermal conductivity of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) can approach 1700–2000 W/(m·K), which has the same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for [[graphene]], and can be comparable to the theoretical calculations for graphene nanoribbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = J.

The thermal conductivity of zigzag-edged BNNRs is about 20% larger than that of armchair-edged nanoribbons at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Tao Ouyang, Yuanping Chen, Yuee Xie, Kaike Yang, Zhigang Bao and Jianxin Zhong|title = Thermal transport in hexagonal boron nitride nanoribbons | doi = 10.1088/0957-4484/21/24/245701|journal = Nanotechnology |volume = 21 |issue = 24|year = 2010 |page = 245701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
Boron nitride has not been found in nature and therefore is produced synthetically. The most common raw materials for BN synthesis, boric acid and boron trioxide are produced on industrial scales by treating minerals [[borax]] and [[colemanite]] with [[sulfuric acid]] or [[hydrochloric acid]]:
:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;·10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (borax) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 4 H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (boric acid) + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Boron trioxide is obtained by heating boric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pradyot Patnaik|year = 2003|title =Handbook of Inorganic Chemical Compounds|publisher = McGraw-Hill|page = 119| isbn =0070494398|url= http://books.google.com/?id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation and reactivity of hexagonal BN===
Hexagonal boron nitride is obtained by the reacting boron trioxide (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or boric acid (B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[urea]] (CO(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in nitrogen atmosphere:&lt;ref name=prod&gt;{{cite journal| author= S. Rudolph| journal = American Ceramic Society Bulletin| volume = 79|year =2000| page = 50| url = http://www.a-m.de/deu/literatur/cb0600.html|title=Boron Nitride: Mineral Review 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 BN + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (T = 900&amp;nbsp;°C)
:B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → BN + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (T = 900&amp;nbsp;°C)
:B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CO(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 BN + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (T &gt; 1000&amp;nbsp;°C)
:B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 10 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 20 BN + 3 CaO (T &gt; 1500&amp;nbsp;°C)

The resulting disordered ([[amorphous]]) boron nitride contains 92–95% BN and 5–8% B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The remaining B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be evaporated in a second step at temperatures &gt;1500&amp;nbsp;°C in order to achieve BN concentration &gt;98%. Such annealing also crystallizes BN, the size of the crystallites increasing with the annealing temperature.&lt;ref name=dkg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://hubacek.jp/bn/bn.htm|accessdate=2009-06-06|title=Synthesis of Boron Nitride from Oxide Precursors|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071212115253/http://hubacek.jp/bn/bn.htm |archivedate = December 12, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

h-BN parts can be fabricated inexpensively by hot-pressing with subsequent machining. The parts are made from boron nitride powders adding boron oxide for better compressibility.

===Preparation of cubic BN===
Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods as that of diamond: Cubic boron nitride is produced by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as [[synthetic diamond]] is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18 GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230&amp;nbsp;°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion.&lt;ref name=wentorf&gt;{{cite journal| author = R. H. Wentorf| title = Cubic form of boron nitride| journal = J. Chem. Phys.|volume = 26|page = 956|year = 1957|doi = 10.1063/1.1731679| issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of a small amount of boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4–7 GPa and temperature to 1500&amp;nbsp;°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine.&lt;ref name=vel&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/0921-5107(91)90121-B |title = Cubic boron nitride: synthesis, physicochemical properties and applications| author = L.

The shock wave method is used to produce material called [[heterodiamond]], a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = T.

Low-pressure deposition of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, the major problem is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, [[boron trifluoride]] is used for c-BN. [[Ion beam deposition]], [[plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]], [[pulsed laser deposition]], [[Sputter deposition|reactive sputtering]], and other [[physical vapor deposition]] methods are used as well.&lt;ref name=cvd/&gt;

===Preparation of wurtzite BN===
Wurtzite BN can be obtained via static high-pressure or dynamic shock methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Characterization of wurtzite type boron nitride synthesized by shock compression|author = T. Soma|journal = Materials Research Bulletin| volume = 9|year = 1974 |page = 755| doi = 10.1016/0025-5408(74)90110-X| last2 = Sawaoka| first2 = A| last3 = Saito| first3 = S| issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limits of its stability are not well defined. Both c-BN and w-BN are formed by compressing h-BN, but formation of w-BN occurs at much lower temperatures close to 1700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=vel/&gt;

===Production statistics===
Whereas the production and consumption figures for the raw materials used for BN synthesis, namely boric acid and boron trioxide, are well known (see [[boron]]), the corresponding numbers for the boron nitride are not listed in statistical reports. An estimate for the 1999 world production is 300 to 350 metric tons. The major producers and consumers of BN are located in the United States, Japan, China and Germany. In 2000, prices varied from about $75/kg to $120/kg for standard industrial-quality h-BN and were about up to $200–$400/kg for high purity BN grades.&lt;ref name=prod/&gt;

==Applications==
===Hexagonal BN===
[[Image:BNcrucible.jpg|thumb|right|Ceramic BN crucible]]
Hexagonal BN is the most widely used polymorph. It is a good lubricant at both low and high temperatures (up to 900&amp;nbsp;°C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in [[cosmetics]], [[paint]]s, [[dental cement]]s, and [[pencil]] leads.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book| author = Jochen Greim, Karl A. Schwetz |title = Boron Carbide, Boron Nitride, and Metal Borides, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher = Wiley-VCH: Weinheim |year = 2005 |doi = 10.1002/14356007.a04_295.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hexagonal BN was first used in cosmetics around 1940 in [[Japan]]. However, because of its high price, h-BN was soon abandoned for this application. Its use was revitalized in the late 1990s with the optimization h-BN production processes, and currently h-BN is used by nearly all leading producers of cosmetic products for [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundations]], [[make-up]], [[eye shadow]]s, blushers, [[eye liner|kohl pencils]], [[lipstick]]s and other skincare products.&lt;ref name=dkg/&gt;

Because of its excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] and in steelmaking.&lt;ref name=dkg/&gt; Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows, and as a structural material for seals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= R.F. Davis| title = III-V nitrides for electronic and optoelectronic applications| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE| year = 1991| volume= 79| pages = 702–712| doi = 10.1109/5.90133| issue= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexagonal BN is used in [[Xerography|xerographic process]] and [[laser printer]]s as a charge leakage barrier layer of the photo drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = L.B. Schein|title = Electrophotography and Development Physics, Springer Series in Electrophysics|volume = 14|publisher = Springer-Verlag, Berlin |year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the automotive industry, h-BN mixed with a binder (boron oxide) is used for sealing oxygen sensors, which provide feedback for adjusting fuel flow. The binder utilizes the unique temperature stability and insulating properties of h-BN.&lt;ref name=dkg/&gt;

Parts can be made of h-BN by [[hot pressing]]. [[Union Carbide Corporation]] produces three grades of BN. HBN, with boron oxide [[binder (material)|binder]], usable to 550–850&amp;nbsp;°C in oxidizing atmosphere and up to 1600 °C in vacuum, but due to the boron oxide content is sensitive to water. HBR uses [[calcium borate]] binder and is usable at 1600&amp;nbsp;°C. HBC grade uses no binder and can be used to 3000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Charles A. Harper| title = Handbook of ceramics, glasses and diamonds|publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2001|isbn = 007026712X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cubic boron nitride===
Cubic boron nitride (CBN or c-BN) is widely used as an [[abrasive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mprg&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first1 = Robert H.|last1 = Todd|first2 = Dell K.|last2 = Allen|first3 = Leo|last3 = Alting|year = 1994|title = Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide|publisher = Industrial Press Inc.|pages = 43–48|url = http://books.google.com/?id=6x1smAf_PAcC|isbn = 0-8311-3049-0|postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its usefulness arises from its insolubility in [[iron]], [[nickel]], and related [[alloys]] at high temperatures, whereas diamond is soluble in these metals to give carbides. Polycrystalline c-BN (PCBN) abrasives are therefore used for machining steel, whereas diamond abrasives are preferred for aluminum alloys, ceramics, and stone. When in contact with oxygen at high temperatures, BN forms a passivation layer of boron oxide. Boron nitride binds well with metals, due to formation of interlayers of metal borides or nitrides. Materials with cubic boron nitride crystals are often used in the [[tool bit]]s of [[cutting tool]]s. For grinding applications, softer binders, e.g. resin, porous ceramics, and soft metals, are used. Ceramic binders can be used as well. Commercial products are known under names &quot;[[Borazon]]&quot; (by Diamond Innovations), and &quot;Elbor&quot; or &quot;Cubonite&quot; (by Russian vendors). Similar to diamond, the combination in c-BN of highest thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity is ideal for heat spreaders. Contrary to diamond, large c-BN pellets can be produced in a simple process (called sintering) of annealing c-BN powders in nitrogen flow at temperatures slightly below the BN decomposition temperature. This ability of c-BN and h-BN powders to fuse allows cheap production of large BN parts.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

As cubic boron nitride consists of light atoms and is very robust chemically and mechanically, it is one of the popular materials for X-ray membranes: low mass results in small X-ray absorption, and good mechanical properties allow usage of thin membranes, thus further reducing the absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = M.

===Amorphous boron nitride===
Layers of amorphous boron nitride (a-BN) are used in some [[semiconductor devices]], e.g. [[MISFET]]s. They can be prepared by chemical decomposition of [[trichloroborazine]] with [[caesium]], or by thermal chemical vapor deposition methods. Thermal CVD can be also used for deposition of h-BN layers, or at high temperatures, c-BN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= W. Schmolla|title = Positive drift effect of BN-InP enhancement n-channel MISFET| doi =10.1080/00207218508939000 |journal =International Journal of Electronics |volume =58 |year =1985 |page = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other BN forms==
===Boron nitride fibers===
Hexagonal BN can be prepared in the form of fibers, structurally similar to [[carbon (fiber)|carbon fiber]]s, by thermal decomposition of extruded [[borazine]] (B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) fibers with addition of boron oxide in a nitrogen atmosphere at 1800&amp;nbsp;°C. An alternative method is thermal decomposition of [[cellulose]] fibers impregnated with boric acid or [[ammonium tetraborate]] in an atmosphere of ammonia and nitrogen above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. Boron nitride fibers are used as reinforcement in [[composite material]]s, with the matrix materials ranging from organic resins to ceramics to metals (see [[Metal matrix composites]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = T.

Structurally, it is a close analog of the carbon nanotube, namely a long cylinder with diameter of several to hundred nanometers and length of many micrometers, except carbon atoms are alternately substituted by nitrogen and boron atoms. However, the properties of BN nanotubes are very different: whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the rolling direction and radius, a BN nanotube is an electrical insulator with a bandgap of ~5.5 eV, basically independent of tube chirality and morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1209/0295-5075/28/5/007|title=Stability and Band Gap Constancy of Boron Nitride Nanotubes|year=1994|last1=Blase|first1=X|last2=Rubio|first2=A|last3=Louie|first3=S.

Like BN fibers, boron nitride nanotubes show promise for aerospace applications where integration of boron and in particular the light isotope of boron (&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B) into structural materials improves their radiation-shielding properties; the improvement is due to strong neutron absorption by &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B. Such &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;BN materials are of particular theoretical value as composite structural materials in future manned interplanetary spacecraft, where absorption-shielding from cosmic ray [[spallation]] neutrons is expected to be a particular asset in light construction materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= J.

===Composites containing BN===
Addition of boron nitride to [[silicon nitride]] ceramics improves the [[thermal shock]] resistance of the resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-[[alumina]] and [[titanium nitride]]-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN are, e.g., alumina and [[zirconia]], [[borosilicate glass]]es, [[glass ceramic]]s, [[vitreous enamel|enamels]], and composite ceramics with [[titanium boride]]-boron nitride and titanium boride-[[aluminium nitride]]-boron nitride and [[silicon carbide]]-boron nitride composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Handbook of Composite Reinforcements|author = S. M. Lee| publisher = John Wiley and Sons |year = 1992 |isbn = 0471188611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health issues==
Boron nitride (along with Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, NbN, and BNC) is reported to show weak [[fibrigenic]] activity and cause [[pneumoconiosis]]. The maximum concentration recommended for nitrides of nonmetals is 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for BN and 4 for AlN or ZrN.&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

'''''Blood on the Tracks''''' is [[Bob Dylan]]'s 15th studio album, released by [[Columbia Records]] in January 1975. The album marked Dylan's return to Columbia after a two-album stint with [[Asylum Records]].

The album, which followed years of lukewarm reception for Dylan's work, was greeted enthusiastically by fans and critics. In the years following its release it has come to be regarded as one of his best albums; it is quite common for subsequent records to be labeled his &quot;best since ''Blood on the Tracks''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

It is also commonly seen as a standard for confessional singer-songwriter albums; though Dylan has denied that the songs are autobiographical, his son [[Jakob Dylan]] has stated: &quot;The songs are my parents talking.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sounes&quot;&gt;Sounes, Howard. ''Down the Highway The Life Of Bob Dylan'' Doubleday 2001. ISBN 0-552-99929-6 p333&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the lyrics on the album revolve around heartache, anger, and loneliness. In 2003, the album was ranked number 16 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].

The album reached #1 on the [[Billboard Music Charts|Billboard]] U.S. pop charts and #4 in the UK. The single &quot;[[Tangled Up in Blue]]&quot; peaked at #31 on the [[pop music|pop]] singles chart. The album remains one of Dylan's all-time best-selling studio releases, with a [[platinum record|double-platinum]] US certification to date.&lt;ref&gt;

== Recording ==
Initially, Dylan considered recording ''Blood on the Tracks'' with an electric backing group, and even contacted [[Mike Bloomfield]], a guitarist who had worked with him on ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]''. The two met, and Dylan showcased the songs he was planning to record, but he played them too quickly for Bloomfield to learn.&lt;ref name=williamson&gt;{{cite book
|last = Williamson

|title = ''The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan''
|isbn = 1-84535-139-9
|publisher = Rough Guides
| pages = 111–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomfield later recalled the experience: &quot;They all began to sound the same to me; they were all in the same [[key (music)|key]]; they were all long. It was one of the strangest experiences of my life. He was sort of pissed off that I didn't pick it up&quot;. In the end, Dylan rejected the idea of recording the album with a band, and instead substituted stripped-down acoustic arrangements for all of his songs.&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt; 

Dylan arrived at [[Columbia Records|Columbia's]] A&amp;R Studios on September 16, 1974, where it was soon realized that he was taking a &quot;spontaneous&quot; approach to recording.&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt; The session engineer at the time, [[Phil Ramone]], later said that he would &quot;go from one song to another like a medley. Sometimes he will have several bars, and in the next version, he will change his mind about how many bars there should be in between a verse. Or eliminate a verse. Or add a chorus when you don't expect&quot;. [[Eric Weissberg]] and his band, Deliverance, originally recruited as session men, were rejected after two days of recording because they could not keep up with Dylan's pace.&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt; However, Dylan did retain [[bass guitar|bassist]] Tony Brown from the band, and soon added [[organ (instrument)|organist]] [[Paul Griffin (musician)|Paul Griffin]] (who had also worked on ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'') and [[steel guitar]]ist [[Buddy Cage]].&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt; After ten days&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt; and four sessions&lt;ref&gt;Bjorner, [http://bjorner.com/74%201-6.htm#_Toc522515522 1974 On the Road Again: Calender] Bjorner's As the Years Passed the Door. Retrieved September 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with the current lineup, Dylan had finished recording and mixing, and, by November, had cut a [[acetate disc|test pressing]] on the album. Columbia soon began to prepare for the album's imminent release, but, three months later, just before the scheduled launch, Dylan re-recorded several songs at the last minute, in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis']] Sound 80 Studios, utilizing local musicians organized by his brother, [[David Zimmerman (producer)|David Zimmerman]].&lt;ref name=williamson/&gt; Even with this setback, Columbia managed to release ''Blood on the Tracks'' by January 17, 1975.

==Notes==
The songs that make up ''Blood on the Tracks'' are seen by most Dylan biographers as having been inspired by his personal turmoil at the time, particularly his separation from his then-wife [[Sara Dylan]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Andy; Odegard, Kevin, [http://books.google.com/books?id=k2d4FiAU2JcC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''A Simple Twist of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood on the Tracks''], Da Capo Press, 2005 . Cf. pp.187-188.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dylan has never said as much, and in his 2004 memoir, ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1]]'', he purported that the songs have nothing to do with his own personal life, and that they were inspired by the [[List of short stories by Anton Chekhov|short stories]] of [[Anton Chekhov]].&lt;ref&gt;http://rockandrollreport.com/cover-story-interview-bob-dylans-blood-on-the-tracks-with-photography-by-paul-till/&lt;/ref&gt;

Dylan's fans theorize endlessly about his reasons for revamping the album, with one unconfirmed view being that the musical feel of the album had been monotonous, with too many songs in the same key and the same languid rhythm. It has also been said that, just two weeks before the release of ''Blood on the Tracks'', Dylan played an [[acetate disc]] pressing of the record for his brother, his ensuing comments leading Dylan to re-cut five of the songs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/sept97/sharps/sharps2970919.html Salon | Sharps and Flats]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original test pressing is widely bootlegged, only one of the five original takes from it has seen official release (&quot;[[You're a Big Girl Now]]&quot; released on 1985's ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]''). Alternate takes of &quot;[[Tangled Up in Blue]]&quot;, &quot;[[Idiot Wind]]&quot;, and &quot;[[If You See Her, Say Hello]]&quot; from the same sessions were released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991|The Bootleg Series, Vol. 1-3]]'', which also includes &quot;Call Letter Blues&quot;, an outtake. &quot;Up To Me&quot;, another outtake from these sessions, was released on ''Biograph''. &quot;[[Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts]]&quot; is the only song from the New York sessions that has not been officially released.

Told of the album's lasting popularity, Dylan was later to say (in a radio interview by [[Mary Travers (singer)|Mary Travers]]): &quot;A lot of people tell me they enjoy that album. It's hard for me to relate to that. I mean, it, you know, people enjoying that type of pain, you know?&quot;  When speaking as to how the album seems to speak of the artist's own personal pain, Dylan replied that he didn't write &quot;confessional songs&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan&quot; Nigel Williamson, 2004 ISBN 1843531399&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jimmy McDonough]], prior to releasing ''Blood on the Tracks'', Dylan visited [[Neil Young]] in his home in [[Florida]] to showcase the songs on the album and seek out Young's opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/anchor/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780679750963 &quot;Shakey: Neil Young's Biography&quot; by Jimmy McDonough]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''&quot;Love and Theft&quot;''''' is the 31st [[studio album]] by [[Bob Dylan]], released by [[Sony BMG|Columbia Records]] on [[September 11]],  [[2001]]. It featured backing by his touring band of the time, with keyboardist [[Augie Meyers]] added for the [[recording session|sessions]]. It peaked at #5 on the [[Billboard 200]], and has been certified with a [[gold album]] by the [[RIAA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS RIAA website retrieved 03-12-10]. {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5aWxoHiRP|date =2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A limited edition release included two [[bonus tracks]] on a separate [[compact disc|disc]] recorded in the early 1960s, and two years later, on September 16, 2003, this album was one of fifteen Dylan titles reissued and [[remastered]] for [[Super Audio CD|SACD hybrid]] playback.

==Content==
The album continued Dylan's artistic comeback following 1997's ''[[Time Out of Mind]]'', and was given an even more enthusiastic reception. Though often referred to without quotations, the correct title is ''&quot;Love and Theft&quot;''. The title of the album was apparently inspired by historian [[Eric Lott|Eric Lott's]] book ''Love &amp; Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class,'' which was published in 1993. 
&quot;''Love and Theft'' becomes his ''[[Fables of the Reconstruction]]'', to borrow an [[R.E.M.]] album title&quot;, writes Greg Kot in ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' (published September 11, 2001), &quot;the myths, mysteries and folklore of the South as a backdrop for one of the finest roots-rock albums ever made.&quot;

The opening track, &quot;'Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum', includes many references to parades in Mardi Gras in New Orleans, where participants are masked, and &quot;determined to go all the way&quot; of the parade route, in spite of being intoxicated. &quot;It rolls in like a storm, drums galloping over the horizon into ear shot, guitar riffs slicing with terse dexterity while a tale about a pair of vagabonds unfolds,&quot; writes Kot. &quot;It ends in death, and sets the stage for an album populated by rogues, con men, outcasts, gamblers, gunfighters and desperados, many of them with nothing to lose, some of them out of their minds, all of them quintessentially American.

&quot;They're the kind of twisted, instantly memorable characters one meets in [[John Ford]]'s westerns, [[Jack Kerouac]]'s road novels, but, most of all, in the blues and country songs of the 1920s, '30s and '40s. This is a tour of American music—jump blues, slow blues, rockabilly, [[Tin Pan Alley]] ballads, country swing—that evokes the sprawl, fatalism and subversive humor of Dylan's sacred text, [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith]]'s ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]],'' the pre-rock voicings of [[Hank Williams, Sr.|Hank Williams]], [[Charley Patton]] and [[Johnnie Ray]], among others, and the ultradry humor of [[Groucho Marx]].&quot;

Offered the song by Dylan, [[Sheryl Crow]] later recorded an up-tempo cover of &quot;[[Mississippi (Bob Dylan song)|Mississippi]]&quot; for her ''[[The Globe Sessions]]'', released in 1998, before Dylan revisited it for ''Love and Theft''. Subsequently the [[Dixie Chicks]] made it a mainstay of their [[Top of the World Tour|Top of the World]], [[Vote for Change]], and [[Accidents &amp; Accusations Tour]]s.

As Tim Riley of [[National Public Radio|NPR]] notes, &quot;[Dylan's] singing [on ''Love and Theft''] shifts artfully between humble and ironic...'I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound,' he sings in 'Floater,' which is either hilarious or horrifying, and probably a little of both.&quot;

&quot;''Love and Theft'' is, as the title implies, a kind of homage,&quot; writes Kot, &quot;[and] never more so than on 'High Water (for [[Charley Patton]]),' in which Dylan draws a sweeping portrait of the South's racial history, with the unsung blues singer as a symbol of the region's cultural richness and ingrained social cruelties. Rumbling drums and moaning backing vocals suggest that things are going from bad to worse. 'It's tough out there,' Dylan rasps. 'High water everywhere.' Death and dementia shadow the album, tempered by tenderness and wicked gallows humor.&quot;

&quot;'Po Boy', scored for banjo with lounge chord jazz patterns, 'almost sounds as if it could have been recorded around 1920,&quot; says Riley. &quot;He leaves you dangling at the end of each bridge, lets the band punctuate the trail of words he's squeezed into his lines, which gives it a reluctant soft-shoe charm.&quot;

The album closes with &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;, a lengthy, dirge-like ballad, noted for its evocative, apocalyptic imagery and sparse production drenched in echo. Praising it as &quot;a finale to be proud of,&quot; Riley notes that &quot;Sugar Baby&quot; is &quot;built on a disarmingly simple riff that turns foreboding.&quot;

==Recording==
This album has been incorrectly cited as being recorded digitally into ProTools.{{fact|date=January 2011}} This album was recorded to a Studer A800 mkIII @ 30ips on BASF/Emtec 900 tape at +6/250 nanowebers per meter. Pro Tools was used solely for editing of specific tracks and was thus used very sparingly. Whatever work was done in ProTools was flown right back to the {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} masters. It was mixed from the {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} masters to an Ampex ATR-102 1-inch 2-track customized by Mark Spitz at ATR Services.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In an interview conducted by Alan Jackson for ''The Times'' Magazine in 2001, before the album was released, Dylan said &quot;these so-called connoisseurs of Bob Dylan music...I don't feel they know a thing, or have any inkling of who I am and what I’m about. I know they think they do, and yet it’s ludicrous, it's humorous, and sad. That such people have spent so much of their time thinking about who? Me? Get a life, please. It’s not something any one person should do about another. You’re not serving your own life well. You’re wasting your life.&quot;

In a glowing review for his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column published by ''The Village Voice'', Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;Before minstrelsy scholar Eric Lott gets too excited about having his title stolen . . . he should recall that Dylan called his first cover album ''Self Portrait''. Dylan meant that title, of course, and he means this one too, which doesn't make ''&quot;Love and Theft&quot;'' his minstrelsy album any more than ''Self Portrait'''s dire &quot;Minstrel Boy&quot; was his minstrelsy song. All pop music is love and theft, and in 40 years of records whose sources have inspired volumes of scholastic exegesis, Dylan has never embraced that truth so warmly. Jokes, riddles, apercus, and revelations will surface for years, but let those who chart their lives by Dylan's cockeyed parables tease out the details. I always go for tone, spirit, music. If ''[[Time Out of Mind]]'' was his death album—it wasn't, but you know how people talk—this is his immortality album. It describes an eternal circle on masterful blazz and jop readymades that render his grizzled growl as juicy as Justin Timberlake's tenor—Tony Bennett's, even. It's profound, too, by which I mean very funny. 'I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,' he wheezes, because time he's got plenty of.&quot; Christgau gave the album an A+. Later, when ''[[The Village Voice]]'' conducted its [[Pazz &amp; Jop]] Critics Poll for 2001, ''&quot;Love and Theft&quot;'' topped the list, the third Dylan album to accomplish this.

In 2003, the album was ranked #467 on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]], while [[Newsweek]] magazine pronounced it the second best album of its decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://2010.newsweek.com/top-10/best-albums/love-and-theft-bob-dylan.html| title = #2 'Love and Theft' Bob Dylan | accessdate = 2009-12-27| publisher = Newsweek | date = 2009-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Glide Magazine [http://www.glidemagazine.com/] ranked it as the #1 Album of the Decade.

| date = 2003-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translated to English by [[John Bester]], the book was a biography of one of the last traditional [[Yakuza]] bosses in Japan. In the article published in the ''Journal'', a line from &quot;Floater&quot; (&quot;I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound&quot;) was traced to a line in the book, which said &quot;I'm not as cool or forgiving as I might have sounded.&quot; Another line from &quot;Floater&quot; is &quot;My old man, he's like some feudal lord.&quot;  On the first lines of the book is the line &quot;My old man would sit there like a feudal lord.&quot; However, when informed of this, author Saga's reaction was to feel honored and not abused at Dylan's use of lines from his work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean Wilentz|Wilentz, Sean]].

[[File:Beverly Hillbillies Episode 18 Jed Saves The Drysdales Marriage.ogg|thumb|Beverly Hillbillies Episode 18: Jed Saves The Drysdales Marriage]]
'''''The Beverly Hillbillies''''' is an American situation comedy originally broadcast for nine seasons on [[CBS]] from 1962 to 1971, starring [[Buddy Ebsen]], [[Irene Ryan]], [[Donna Douglas]], and [[Max Baer Jr]].

The series is about a poor backwoods family transplanted to [[Beverly Hills, California]], after striking oil on their land. A [[Filmways]] production created by writer Paul Henning, it is the first in a genre of &quot;fish out of water&quot; themed television shows, and was followed by other Henning inspired country-cousin series on CBS. In 1963, Henning introduced &quot;[[Petticoat Junction]]&quot; and in 1965 he reversed the rags to riches model for ''[[Green Acres]]''. The show paved the way for later culture-conflict programs such as ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'', ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', and ''[[Doc (TV series)|Doc]]''. Panned by many entertainment critics of its time, it quickly became a huge ratings success for most of its nine-year run on CBS.

''The Beverly Hillbillies'' ranked among the top twelve most watched series on television for seven of its nine seasons, twice ranking as the number one series of the year, with a number of episodes that remain among the most watched television episodes of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime| title = Top 100 TV Shows of All Time| accessdate = April 9, 2009| author = Nielsen Media Research| date = August 6, 2000| publisher = Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing popularity of the series spawned a [[The Beverly Hillbillies (film)|1993 film remake]] by [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Hollywood To Make Movie Of Old 'Beverly Hillbillies'|work= Orlando Sentinel|date=|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-01-24/news/9301240378_1_beverly-hillbillies-dabney-coleman-series-the-beverly|accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''The Beverly Hillbillies'' series starts with the OK [[petroleum|Oil]] Company learning of oil in Jed Clampett's swamp land. Patriarch Jed moves with his family into a mansion next door to his banker (Milburn Drysdale) in the wealthy [[Los Angeles County]] city of [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], California, where he brings a moral, unsophisticated, and minimalistic lifestyle to the swanky, sometimes self-obsessed and superficial community. The theme song introduces the viewer to the world's most fortunate hunting accident – whereby Jed shoots at game but instead hits &quot;black gold.&quot; Double entendres and cultural misconceptions were the core of the sitcom's humor. Frequently, plots involved the outlandish efforts taken by Drysdale to keep the Clampetts in Beverly Hills and their money in his bank. The family's periodic attempts to return to the mountains were often prompted by Granny due to a perceived slight she received from one of the &quot;city-folk.&quot; Beverly Hillbillies accumulated seven Emmy nominations during its run. Nearly a half century since its premiere, the series remains in syndication on several cable networks, including [[TV Land]].

The Hillbillies themselves were [[Buddy Ebsen]] as the widowed patriarch Jed &quot;J.D.&quot; Clampett; [[Irene Ryan]] as his ornery mother-in-law, Daisy May &quot;Granny&quot; Moses; [[Donna Douglas]] as his curvaceous, tom-boy daughter Elly May Clampett; and [[Max Baer Jr]] as Jethro, the brawny, half-witted son of his cousin Pearl Bodine. Pearl (played by [[Bea Benaderet]]) appeared in most of the first season episodes, as did Jethro's twin sister Jethrine, played by Baer in drag, using [[Linda Kaye Henning]]'s voiceover. Pearl was the relative who prodded Jed to move to California, after being told his modest property could yield $25 million.

The supporting cast featured [[Raymond Bailey]] as Jed's greedy, unscrupulous banker Milburn Drysdale; [[Harriet E. MacGibbon]] as Drysdale's ostentatious wife Margaret Drysdale; and [[Nancy Kulp]] as &quot;Miss&quot; Jane Hathaway, Drysdale's scholarly, &quot;plain Jane&quot; secretary, who pined for the clueless Jethro.

While Granny frequently mentioned that she was from [[Tennessee]], the series never specified the state from which the Clampetts moved to California. However, they often referred to nearby towns such as [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]], [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]], [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], and [[Silver Dollar City]], all of which are in southwest [[Missouri]]. In the eighth episode of season 8, named &quot;Manhattan Hillbillies,&quot; Granny tells the police officer in Central Park that her family comes from Taney County (which is in southwest Missouri). Early episodes also contained several references to [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas|Eureka Springs]], which is in northwest [[Arkansas]]. All of the communities are in the [[Ozark Mountains]]. The show's creator was Hamilton (Buddy) Morgan, a television technician from NYC. Producer [[Paul Henning]] is from [[Independence, Missouri]], and donated {{convert|1534|acres|0|abbr=on}} for the Ruth and Paul Henning Conservation Area near Branson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dale Cox |url=http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/henning1.html |title=Ruth and Paul Henning Conservation Area – Branson, Missouri |publisher=Exploresouthernhistory.com |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal trainer Frank Inn provided animals for all three of Hennings's hit shows, which included &quot;Elly May's critters,&quot; such as chimp Alfie who portrayed Cousin Bessie, and Duke, who was Jed's hunting [[bloodhound]]. Cousin Bessie was known to strategically outsmart Jethro whenever the latter attempted to make her a beast of burden.

A three-act stage play based on the pilot was written by David Rogers in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=XqzpiBNwn_EC&amp;dq=beverly+hillbillies&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' stage play, adapted by David Rogers]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theme music ==
The [[theme music|theme song]] &quot;[[The Ballad of Jed Clampett]]&quot; was written by producer and writer [[Paul Henning]] and originally performed by [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] artists [[Flatt and Scruggs]]. The song was sung by [[Jerry Scoggins]] (backed by [[Flatt and Scruggs]]) over the opening and end credits of each episode. It was #44 on the music [[Billboard magazine|charts]] in 1962 and a #1 country hit. Flatt and Scruggs also had another Billboard country top ten hit with the comic &quot;Pearl, Pearl, Pearl,&quot; an ode to the feminine charms of Miss Pearl Bodine who was featured in the episode &quot;Jed Throws a Wingding,&quot; the first of several Flatt and Scruggs appearances on the show.

The six main cast members participated on a 1963 [[Columbia Records]] [[soundtrack]] album which featured original song numbers in character. Additionally, Ebsen, Ryan, and Douglas each made a few solo recordings following the show's success, including Ryan's 1966 novelty single, &quot;Granny's Miniskirt.&quot;

The series generally featured no [[country music]] beyond the bluegrass banjo theme song, although country star [[Roy Clark]] and the team of Flatt and Scruggs occasionally played on the program. Pop singer [[Pat Boone]] appeared on one episode as himself, with the premise that he hailed from the same area of the country as the Clampetts (Boone is, in fact, a native of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida, although he spent most of his childhood in Tennessee).

The 1989 film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' featured a [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]] parody music video, &quot;[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]],&quot; combining &quot;[[The Ballad of Jed Clampett]]&quot; and Dire Straits' &quot;[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]].&quot;

== Popularity ==
Written-off as lowbrow by some critics, the show shot to the top of the [[Nielsen ratings]] shortly after its premiere and stayed there for several seasons. During its first two seasons, it was the number one program in the U.S. During its second season, it earned some of the highest ratings ever recorded for a half-hour sitcom. The season two episode &quot;The Giant Jackrabbit&quot; also became the most watched telecast up to the time of its airing, and remains the [[List of most watched television broadcasts#Top 45 network primetime telecasts of all time (1964-Present)|most watched half-hour episode of a sitcom]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/the-beverly-hillbillies/the-giant-jackrabbit/episode/49372/summary.html The Beverly Hillbillies: The Giant Jackrabbit – TV.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The series enjoyed excellent ratings throughout its run, although it had fallen out of the top 20 most watched shows during its final season.

The series received two [[Emmy]] nominations for Best Comedy Series (1963, 1964) as well as nominations for cast members [[Irene Ryan]] (twice nominated as Best Series Actress, 1963, 1964) and [[Nancy Kulp]] (nominated for Best Comedy Series Supporting Actress, 1966).

===Influence on other television shows===
Because of the show's high ratings, CBS asked creator Paul Henning to pen two more folksy comedies, spawning a mini-genre of rural sitcoms during the 1960s. ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' featured an extended family, including three pretty young women of marrying age, running a small hotel in the isolated rural town of Hooterville. ''[[Green Acres]]'' flipped the Clampetts' fish-out-of-water concept by depicting two city sophisticates moving to Hooterville, which was populated by oddball country bumpkins.

Certain actors appeared on more than one of these series:

* Bea Benaderet, who had played Jethro's mother during the first season of ''The Beverly Hillbillies,'' was the mother of the family on ''Petticoat Junction''.
* Linda Kaye Henning, who provided the voiceover for the ''Beverly Hillbillies'' character Jethrine, portrayed Benaderet's daughter Betty Jo Bradley on ''Petticoat Junction'' (the only female who remained all seven seasons).
* [[Edgar Buchanan]], who starred in all 222 episodes of ''Petticoat Junction'' and guest-starred in 17 episodes of ''Green Acres,'' also guested in three episodes of ''The Beverly Hillbillies,'' always as the character Uncle Joe Carson.
* [[Charles Lane (actor)|Charles Lane]] played Homer Bedloe, vice president of the C. &amp; F. W. Railroad, on both shows.  He also played an apartment landlord to Jane Hathaway (&quot;Foster Phinney&quot;) during the 1970–71 season.
* Sam Drucker, played by [[Frank Cady]], of both ''Petticoat Junction'' and ''Green Acres,'' also appeared in several episodes of the ''Beverly Hillbillies''.
* Several animal actors trained by [[Frank Inn]], including [[Higgins (dog)|Higgins the dog]], also moved between series as needed.

Despite the actor cross-overs and the character Uncle Joe Carson's multiple appearances (which made it clear that the three shows were set in the same [[fictional universe]]), the two Hooterville series retained identities that were distinct from ''The Beverly Hillbillies''.

The 1970–71 season failed to gain a top 30 Nielson placing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1970.htm ClassicTVHits.com: TV Ratings &gt; 1970's]&lt;/ref&gt; and the show was cancelled in 1971 after 274 episodes. The CBS network, prompted by pressure from [[advertising|advertisers]] seeking a more sophisticated [[urban culture|urban]] audience, decided to refocus its schedule on several &quot;hip&quot; new urban-themed shows and, to make room for them, all of CBS's rural-themed comedies were simultaneously cancelled, despite some considerable Nielsen ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Why Fox News let Glenn Beck go |work= [[Guardian]]|date=|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/apr/07/glenn-beck-fox-news|accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action came to be known as &quot;the [[Rural purge|Rural Purge]].&quot; [[Pat Buttram]], who played Mr Haney on ''Green Acres'', famously remarked that, &quot;It was the year CBS killed everything with a tree in it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kenberry.com/ken_berry_interview.htm Ken Berry interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ''The Beverly Hillbillies'', the series that were eliminated included ''[[Green Acres]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', and ''[[Hee Haw]]'', the last of which was resurrected in first-run [[television syndication|syndication]], where it ran for another twenty-one years. ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' had been canceled a year earlier due to declining ratings following the death of its star, [[Bea Benaderet]].

==Main cast==
; J.D. &quot;Jed&quot; Clampett: Although he had received little formal education, Jed Clampett has a good deal of common sense. A good-natured man, he is the apparent head of the family. Jed's wife (Elly May's mother) died but is referred to in the episode &quot;Duke Steals A Wife&quot; as Rose Ellen. Jed is shown to be an expert marksman and is extremely loyal to his family and kinfolk. The huge oil pool in the swamp he owned was the beginning of his rags-to-riches journey to Beverly Hills. Although he longs for the old ways back in the hills, he makes the best of being in Beverly Hills. Whenever he has anything on his mind, he sits on the curbstone of his mansion and whittles until he comes up with the answer. Jed's full first name is never given in the television series, though 'Jedediah' was used in the 1993 ''Beverly Hillbillies'' theatrical movie (coincidentally, on Ebsen's subsequent series, ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', Barnaby's nephew J.R. was also named Jedediah). In one episode Jed and Granny reminisce about seeing [[Buddy Ebsen]] and [[Vilma Ebsen]]—a joking reference to the Ebsens' song and dance act. Jed appears in all 274 episodes.

; Granny (Daisy May Moses): Called &quot;Granny&quot; by all, relatives or not, shotgun-toting Daisy Moses, Jed's mother-in-law, is a true daughter of [[Dixie]]. Paul Henning, the show's creator/producer quickly disposed of the idea of Granny being Jed's mother, which would have changed the show's dynamics, making Granny the matriarch and Jed subordinate to her. Granny can be aggressive but is often over-ruled by Jed. She is a revisionist reb to the core, defending President Jefferson Davis, the Stars and Bars, and the simple life.  Short-fused and easily angered, Granny fancies herself a &quot;dunked&quot; (not &quot;sprinkled&quot;) Christian with forgiveness in her heart. She abhors &quot;revenuers&quot; and blue-coat Yankees. A self-styled &quot;M.D.&quot;&amp;nbsp;— &quot;mountain doctor&quot;&amp;nbsp;— she claims to have an edge over expensive know-nothing city physicians. In lieu of anesthesia, Granny uses her &quot;white lightning&quot; brew before commencing on painful treatments such as leech bleeding and yanking teeth with pliers. Short and scrappy, she often wields a double-barreled, 12-gauge shotgun. The lone time she shoots it (with rock salt) was during a mock Indian invasion created by Mr. Drysdale. She is also able to tell the precise time via a sun dial and the weather via a beetle (Granny Verses the Weather Bureau). Without her glasses, Granny is extremely nearsighted&amp;nbsp;— once in a crossover with the [[Green Acres]] show, Granny mistakes a dog for a baby child and a coffee pot for a telephone. Two of Granny's phobias are &quot;Injuns&quot; (she actually buys wigs so the Clampetts won't be &quot;scalped&quot;) and the &quot;cement pond&quot; ([[swimming pool]]–she has a fear of water). In a long [[story arc]] in the show's ninth season, Elly May dates a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] frogman, which confuses Granny: After seeing the frogman climb out of the pool in his skin-diving wear, she thinks that anyone who swims in the pool will be turned into a frog. She also has a peculiar way of retelling the [[American Civil War]], in which she thinks the South has won and [[Jefferson Davis]] is the president, while calling Sherman's March as 'Sherman's Retreat to the Sea.' Any attempts to correct her meet with failure. She is also known for slicing off switches to use on Jethro, mainly whenever he goes too far with his dumb and idiotic schemes.
:There are references to Granny growing up in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. From episode 9: &quot;When I was a girl back in Tennessee, I set so many boys' hearts on fire that they took to calling that neck of the woods ''The Smoky Mountains''.&quot;
:Granny's full name, Daisy Moses, allegedly an homage to the popular and dearly loved folk artist [[Anna Mary Robertson]], known to the world as [[Grandma Moses]]. (Grandma Moses died in 1961, a year before ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' made its television debut.) Granny is frequently referred to as &quot;Granny Clampett&quot; in a number of episodes but technically she is a Moses. Granny appears in all 274 episodes.

; Elly May Clampett: Elly May, Jed's only child, is a mountain beauty with the body of a [[Pin-up girl|pinup girl]] and the soul of a [[tomboy]]. She can throw a [[fastball]] as well as &quot;[[wrestling|rassle]]&quot; most men to a fall, and she can be as tender with her friends, animals, and family as she is tough with anyone she rassles. She said once that animals could be better companions than people, but as she grew older she saw that, &quot;fellas kin be more fun than critters.&quot; Elly is squired about by eager young [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] actors with stage names like &quot;Dash Riprock&quot; and &quot;Bolt Upright.&quot; Other boyfriends for Elly include Sonny Drysdale, Beau Short, beatnik Sheldon Epps, and Mark Templeton, a frogman.
:Elly's most notable weakness, oft mentioned when she is being &quot;courted,&quot; is her lack of kitchen skills. Family members cringe when, for plot reasons, Elly takes over the kitchen. Rock-like donuts and cookies, for example, are a plot function in an episode featuring [[Wally Cox]] as bird watching Professor Biddle.
:Elly is briefly considered for film stardom at the movie studio owned by Jed. In one episode, hearing [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Cary Grant]] are both single, Granny asks that Elly be introduced to them.
:During the final season Elly May takes a job as a secretary at the Commerce Bank after Jed and Granny persuade her that it would be a good way to &quot;meet a husband.&quot;
:In the 1981 TV movie of ''The Beverly Hillbillies'', Elly May is head of a zoo. Elly May appears in all 274 episodes.

; Jethro Bodine: Jethro (though he addresses Jed as his uncle) is the son of Jed's cousin, Pearl Bodine. He drove the Clampett family to their new home in California and stayed on with them to further his education. The whole family boasts of Jethro's &quot;sixth grade education&quot; but nevertheless feels he is a bit of an idiot. Jethro is simply naive in the first season of the show but becomes incredibly ignorant and pompous as the series progresses. He often shows off his cyphering abilities with multiplication and &quot;go-zin-ta's,&quot; as in &quot;five gozinta five one times, five gozinta ten two times,&quot; etc.  The tallest student in his class in the town of Oxford (so named because &quot;that's where the oxen used to ford the creek&quot;) because of his age, he is often impressing others that he graduated &quot;top of his class at Oxford.&quot;  In Beverly Hills, he decides to go to college. He manages to enroll late in the semester at a local secretarial school due to his financial backing and earns his diploma by the end of the day because he didn't understand what was going on in class and was too disruptive. (This was an ironic [[in-joke]]—in real life Max Baer Jr, has a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration from [[Santa Clara University]](Also Minored in Philosophy)).
:Many stories in the series involve Jethro's endless career search, which include such diverse vocations as [[neurosurgeon|brain surgeon]], street car conductor, [[James Bond|double-naught spy]], Hollywood producer (a studio flunky remarks Jethro has the ''right qualifications'' for being a producer-a 6th grade education and his uncle owns the studio. The in-joke gag of Jethro as a movie producer was replayed in the 1981 movie), [[soda jerk]], short order cook, and once as a [[bookkeeper]] for Milburn Drysdale's bank. More often than not, his overall goal in these endeavors is to obtain as many pretty girls as humanly possible. Out of all the Clampett clan, he is the one who makes the most change from 'country bumpkin' to 'city boy.' Another [[running gag]] is that Jethro is known as the &quot;six foot stomach&quot; for his ability to eat: in one episode he eats a jetliner's entire supply of steaks; in another episode Jethro tries to set himself up as a Hollywood agent for cousin &quot;Bessie&quot;-with a fee of 10,000 bananas for Bessie and 1,000 bananas for Jethro. At one times Jed mentions that Jethro was the only baby he knew born with a full set of teeth &quot;just like a beaver.&quot; Jethro appears in 272 episodes; he is not in the third- or second-to-last episodes but Baer of course remains billed in the title credits. Baer claimed he only auditioned for the role of Jethro for fun and never expected to get the part. Supposedly, he clinched the part largely because of his grin.

; Duke: The Clampetts' family dog. He's an old bloodhound that Jed had bought for four bits (50 cents) when he was a puppy. In early episodes, Jethro tries to teach Duke to fetch sticks, though to Jed it looks as if Duke is teaching Jethro how to do the trick. In a couple of episodes, Duke gets involved with a French [[poodle]] that was brought in to mate with Mrs. Drysdale's pampered pooch Claude. Apparently, the poodle has better taste and has Duke's puppies instead. When Mrs. Drysdale wants Claude to get revenge against Duke, Jed warns her that he's seen that old hound dog hold his own against a [[bobcat]].

; The Drysdales: Milburn, Margaret, and Sonny: The Drysdales are the Clampetts' next door neighbors. Milburn is the Commerce Bank's tightwad president and the friendly bumpkins' confidant. The haughty Mrs. Drysdale touts a heritage that traces back to the Mayflower, but money-hungry Milburn's concerns are strictly monetary. When suffering an anxiety attack, Milburn sniffs a stack of money and is quickly revived. Mr. Drysdale appeases the Clampetts and says that anything they do is unquestionably right. He often forces others, especially his secretary, to placate the Clampetts' by granting their unorthodox requests. Although wife Margaret, a blue-blooded Bostonian, has obvious disdain for the &quot;peasant&quot; hillbillies, she tacitly agrees to tolerate them (rather than Milburn lose their ever growing account--which is $96,000,000 in 1969, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|96000000|1969}}}} today). Margaret loathes all four &quot;vagabonds,&quot; but her most heated rivalry is with Granny, with whom she occasionally has some &quot;scraps.&quot; Ray Bailey appears in 247 episodes. [[Harriet MacGibbon]] appears in 55 episodes between 1962 and 1969, she is not seen in the last two seasons of the show although is occasionally mentioned. Margaret's aged father has gambled away most of their money. Mrs. Drysdale's son--and Milburn's Stepson--is Sonny (played by [[Louis Nye]]), who is a thirty-something collegian who doesn't believe in working up a sweat and is an insufferable [[mama's boy]]. Finding Elly May a lovely, naive Pollyanna, he courts her until she literally tosses him. Although the character is fondly remembered by fans, Sonny only appears in four episodes, three in 1962 and a final appearance in 1966. 
[[Image:Max Baer Jr, Nancy Kulp and Sharon Tate in The Beverly Hillbillies, The Giant Jackrabbit episode.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Nancy Kulp]] (center) as The Beverly Hillbillies' Jane Hathaway]]
; Jane Hathaway: Jane Hathaway, whom the Clampetts addressed as &quot;Miss Jane,&quot; is Drysdale's loyal and efficient secretarial assistant. Though she always carried out his wishes, she was inherently decent and was frequently put off by her boss' greed. When she was annoyed with him, as was often especially when one of Drysdale's schemes went too far, she would usually and forcefully say ''&quot;Chief!&quot;'' Unlike Drysdale (who was merely interested in the Clampetts' wealth), Jane was genuinely fond of them (to the Clampetts, she was considered family; even Granny, the one most dead-set against living in California, liked her very much and thought of her as part of the family), in fact, she actually harbored something of a crush on Jethro for most of the series' run. At first, she mistook the Clampetts as the servants, until she realized who they really were (which almost cost her her job). Miss Hathaway frequently has to &quot;rescue&quot; Drysdale from his idiotic schemes, receiving little or no thanks for her efforts. In one episode, she and Granny, disguised as &quot;[[Geisha#&quot;Geisha girls&quot;|geisha girl]]s,&quot; finally have enough and &quot;crown&quot; Drysdale and Jethro, who have made one too many comments about women serving men. Jane is loyal to Drysdale as well, despite her misgivings toward his avarice and greed. In one episode, the Clampetts, feeling money has corrupted them, give all of their money to Virginia &quot;Ginny&quot; Jennings ([[Sheila Kuehl]]), a college student. While Drysdale moans the loss of the money, Jane immediately tells him to stop thinking about the Clampetts and start trying to get the Jennings account. Eventually, everyone discovered Jennings' real motives, and she was gone, with the Clampetts getting their money back, and things were as they were before. In one episode, it is established that Miss Jane sacrificed her job as the top secretary of the top executive of the top insurance company to join Mr. Drysdale at the Commerce Bank. Miss Jane was a Vassar graduate. Jane Hathaway appears in 246 episodes.

===Semi-regulars===
; Pearl Bodine: Jed's cousin Pearl Bodine–portrayed by [[Bea Benaderet]]–was Jethro's widowed mother. In the last season, Granny mentioned that her husband, Fred Bodine, had drowned in a fishing accident when Jethro was just a baby (although, in an earlier episode, Jethro shared some memories of his father with a psychiatrist).  Pearl was a generally well-meaning mother to Jethro. She also was a popular character, often used as a foil for Granny, and became a regular part way through the first season (the end credits were even refilmed to include Pearl with the other family members). She disappeared after the first year because Benaderet had become the star of another [[Paul Henning]] series, ''Petticoat Junction''. Like Elly May, Pearl's name came from that of a character (Pearl Lester) in the popular rural-life novel, play, and film ''Tobacco Road''. Pearl Bodine appears in 22 of the first season's episodes, 1962–63, and later makes a cameo in the 1967 episode &quot;Greetings From The President&quot;. In the episodes &quot;The Clampetts Get Psychoanalyzed&quot; &amp; &quot;The Psychiatrist Gets Clampetted&quot; [[Herbert Rudley]] plays the psychiatrist Dr. Eugene Twombley. In the episodes Pearl is enamored with Dr. Twombley; Benaderet's real life husband is named [[Eugene Twombley]]. The role was first offered to [[Shirley Collie Nelson|Shirley Collie]].

; Jethrine Bodine: Jethrine is Pearl's king-sized daughter, Jethro's twin (and is also played by Baer, though voiced by [[Linda Kaye]]). Jethrine appears in 11 episodes in 1962–63; she moves with her mother to the Clampett mansion later that season but occasionally is not seen in episodes during her stay in California. Jethrine was upset in leaving the hills as it meant separation from her &quot;sweetie&quot;, traveling salesman Jazzbo Depew. Late in the season it was explained in an episode that Jethrine had returned home to marry Depew, although the wedding was never seen in the series (nor was Jethrine ever seen again, although she was occasionally referenced). Jethro and Jethrine rarely appeared in the same scene in any of the programs and then they were never on-camera at the same time except for the rare back-of-the-head shot of one done by a double. Jethrine appears in the 1993 movie version.

; Dash Riprock: Dash played by [[Larry Pennell]] was the handsome Hollywood actor employed by Jed's movie studio. He and Elly May met while she was working as an extra at the studio. Once Dash saw the beautiful Elly in her bathing suit, he was smitten with her. The two had an on-and-off relationship. In one episode, Mr. Drysdale forced Dash into courting Elly May by threatening to put him in a television show called ''Crabman''. Elly initially liked Dash and enjoyed being with him on dates. Jethro, however, was more enamored with Dash and his playboy persona than was his comely cousin. Riprock was a send-up of the blatantly fake screen names employed by a number of movie actor's of the period. Riprock's real name (before being changed by Hollywood moguls) was &quot;Homer Noodleman,&quot; and he was from [[Peoria, Illinois]]. Dash Riprock was in 10 episodes, mainly between 1965–69.

; Lowell Redlings Farquhar: Lowell is the elderly father of Mrs. Drysdale whom Granny considers a potential beau. Lowell (played by [[Charles Ruggles]]) is in three episodes, 1965–66.

; [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]]: Country music stars Flatt and Scruggs (who play themselves in seven episodes, 1963–68),  are longtime friends of the Clampetts &quot;back home&quot; ([[Kimberling City, Missouri]]) who visit with the Clampetts when they are on tour in California. The duo had a number-one [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] country single with the show's &quot;The Ballad of Jed Clampett&quot; (although the song is actually performed in the credits by [[Jerry Scroggins]] to Flatt and Scruggs' instrumental). Actress [[Joi Lansing]] played Flatt's wife, Gladys, in five episodes, 1963–68.

; John Brewster: Brewster (played by [[Frank Wilcox]]), is the President &amp; CEO of the OK Oil company headquartered in Tulsa who purchases the oil rights to the gusher on the Clampett home back in the hills. The Clampetts are quite fond of him, and his wife occasionally visits them in California. John Brewster appears in 14 episodes, 1962–1966.

; Janet Trego: Janet (played by [[Sharon Tate]]) is a beautiful secretary at the Commerce Bank. Although Janet appears in 15 episodes, 1963–65, her role is generally quite minor. Tate was later murdered by [[Charles Manson|Charles Manson's]] &quot;Family&quot; just before the start of the eighth season.

; '''Sam Drucker''': Sam (played by [[Frank Cady]]) owns the general store in Hooterville. Granny is constantly under the impression that Sam wants to marry her, however Sam has no intentions of doing so. He appears in 10 episodes between 1968–1970. Cady also starred as Sam Drucker in ''Petticoat Junction'' and ''Green Acres''. Cady reprised the role of Sam Drucker for the 1990 ''Green Acres'' reunion movie ''Return to Green Acres''

; '''Helen Thompson''': Helen (played by Danielle Mardi) is a beautiful British secretary at the Commerce Bank. Helen takes over Jane Hathaway's job as Mr. Drysdale's secretary after Ms. Hathaway resigned. Helen appears in 17 episodes between 1969–1971. Helen was one of the ringleaders of the protest group the secretaries of the Commerce Bank created, GRUN  (Girls Resist Unfair Neglect). She, along with many other secretaries as well as Elly and Granny, lived with Ms. Hathaway for a short time in her apartment.

; Shorty Kellums: Shorty (played by [[Shug Fisher]]) is Jed's longtime buddy from back home whom Jed reunites with in 1969 when the Clampetts go back for an extended period to the Hills. Shorty is a wiry little man who is crazy about voluptuous girls half his age. Shorty later moves into the Clampett mansion in Beverly Hills for a period. Shorty Kellums appears in 17 episodes in the 1969–70 season, and returned again briefly during 1970–71.

; Elverna Bradshaw: Elverna is Granny's longtime rival back in the Hills, a gossip second to none. She makes a brief appearance in a 1963 episode when the Clampetts go back to the Hills to fetch Pearl to California but is not seen again until 1969 when the Clampetts return to their native land for an extended visit. However, both Granny and Jed referred to the character in several episodes throughout the series' run. Elverna (played by [[Elvia Allman]]) and Granny rekindle their feud in a match to see who will be first wed, Elverna's daughter or Elly May. For reasons not really explained, Elverna also moves into the Clampett Beverly Hills mansion during the same period that Shorty does; both of them, however, are gone from the estate for the final 1970–71 season, presumably having returned home. Elverna Bradshaw appears in 13 episodes, 1963–1970.

; Matthew and Mark Templeton: The Templetons are two brothers both played by actor [[Roger Torrey]], who originally auditioned (unsuccessfully) for the part of Jethro. Matthew is seen in three episodes in October 1969 during the Clampetts stay in the Hills where Granny tags the preacherman as a prospective husband for Elly. Unfortunately, Granny learns that Matthew is married. Just a year later back in California, Elly meets Matthew's brother, Mark Templeton, who is a [[marine biologist]], a [[frogman]] whom Granny believes is actually part frog. The Mark Templeton storyline played out for nine episodes and was abruptly dropped although advance publicity for the show indicated Elly May and Mark would be marrying during the season; however, the show was cancelled at the end of that season as part of the CBS [[Rural Purge]].

===The &quot;critters&quot;===
In addition to the family dog, Duke, a number of animals lived on the Clampett estate thanks to animal-lover Elly. These animals were collectively known as her &quot;critters&quot;.

The most prominent pets were [[chimpanzees]]. The first chimp on the show was named &quot;Skipper&quot;, who was a Christmas present from Mr. Drysdale. The following season, Elly May acquired a female chimp named &quot;Cousin Bessie&quot;, so named because she was Skipper's cousin. She was a regular for the remainder of the series. A [[running gag]] is that Cousin Bessie frequently proves to be smarter than &quot;educated&quot; Jethro. There was also a chimp called Maybelle.

As well as typical pets such as [[dogs]]/[[puppies]] and [[cats]]/[[kittens]] Elly was also shown to keep exotic animals such as [[deer]], [[possum]]s, a [[bear]] named Fairchild, some [[goats]], a [[raccoon]] named Elmer, a [[kangaroo]], Earl the [[rooster]], Charlie the [[skunk]], Gem the [[mink]], a [[Cougar|puma]] named Jethro, a [[Hippopotamus|hippo]] named Harold, a [[sea lion]] named Shorty and many more. There was also a mutt named Jojo and a [[wild pig]] named Pearl.

The trainer of all the animals in the series was [[Frank Inn]], who also trained the animals for the contemporaneous rural comedy series ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' and ''[[Green Acres]]''.

==Series storylines==
Most episodes revolved around the clash between the &quot;uncivilized&quot; hillbilly culture represented by the Clampetts and the &quot;civilized&quot; American culture of the Drysdales. The Clampetts lived as they always had, even in their large, elegant mansion, never abandoning their mountain attire or replacing the old rattletrap truck in which they had moved to California. Although when asked what kind of truck it is, Jethro said 'I think it's a Stutz', it is actually based on a 1921 Oldsmobile. All the Hillbillies were handy with firearms and always seemed to have their weapons close at hand and ready to draw. They continued to grow their own food, and Granny made [[soap|lye soap]] and [[moonshine]]. The extreme potency of the moonshine liquor and the harshness of the lye soap were running gags throughout the run of the series.

As another running joke, the movie theaters back in the hills were still showing films from the [[silent movie]] era and the Hillbillies were unaware of talking pictures or more contemporary movie stars. Granny's favorite actor was [[Hoot Gibson]], but she also had an intense crush on [[William S. Hart]], and the whole Clampett family adored [[Mary Pickford]]. Silent movie legend [[Gloria Swanson]] made a memorable guest appearance on the show as herself in an episode that featured a comic parody of a silent melodrama. The Clampetts did, however, have a television, on which they watched soap operas and &quot;[[Professional wrestling|rasslin']]&quot;, as well as [[John Wayne]] movies, as he was apparently one of the few &quot;talkie&quot; movie stars of whom they were aware. Wayne made a brief cameo as himself after the Clampett mansion was &quot;attacked&quot; by stuntmen dressed as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].

Pearl and Granny often fought for kitchen supremacy. Pearl once told Granny &quot;a blood cousin trumps a mother-in-law&quot;. This underscored a familial disconnect between Jethro and Granny; although they shared no bloodlines, Jethro still called her &quot;Granny&quot; (as did everyone else on the show, including Miss Jane and the Drysdales). Other than their kitchen wars, relations between Granny and Pearl were generally friendly. The second season began with a brief mention of Pearl having moved back to the hills, an ironic departure, as it was Pearl who had urged Jed to move to California. The change came about because actress Bea Benaderet had left the show to star in ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''. Mrs. Drysdale soon became Granny's main sparring partner.

Although both Douglas and Baer were well into their twenties when the series started, during the first years of the series, their characters were supposed to be teenagers. Elly May was enrolled in an elite girls' school in the first season, although no further mention was made of her education in later episodes. Jethro was enrolled in a sixth-grade class with much younger students; a few episodes later on, the scripts suggested that he was still in school.

Should Granny or one of her kin feel lonely for the hills, banker Drysdale would bend over backwards to placate the offended subject. Drysdale went so far as to re-create the [[log cabin]] the Clampetts had lived in and place it right next to the [[swimming pool|&quot;cee-ment pond&quot;]] and the [[still]] Granny had installed to make [[moonshine]]. Another time Drysdale followed the Clampetts to the &quot;Hills&quot; and bought up the [[Silver Dollar City]] &quot;bank&quot; just to make sure he had a controlling interest in the Clampetts' money. One [[running gag]] was that when Jed would take money out of his pocket, Drysdale's blood pressure would go up. A similar [[running joke]] was that when it seemed the Clampetts would take their money out of his bank, Drysdale's face would turn green. A variation of the joke of Drysdale's face changing color is in one episode when, after being given some of Granny's &quot;Tennessee Tranquilizer&quot; (moonshine), Drysdale's face turns red.

Another frequent source of humor dealt with Jethro's endless career search, which included such diverse vocations as soda jerk, brain surgeon, Hollywood celebrity, and secret &quot;double naught&quot; agent/spy. Jethro coveted movie star fame and relished becoming a &quot;playboy&quot; like Elly's beau Dash Riprock. Jethro's stupidity usually caused such career attempts to fail spectacularly, as when he decided to open a &quot;topless&quot; restaurant (&quot;The Happy Gizzard&quot;), where the waiters and waitresses were hatless. The one time in the series when Jethro almost succeeded as a &quot;Hollywood celebrity&quot; was when &quot;Cousin Roy&quot; ([[Roy Clark]]) tried to get Jethro to back him up as a country singer in Hollywood; Jethro refused and failed as usual. Jethro did have one success, of sorts. When he rescued a Bird Watchers girl troop who fell into the &quot;cement pond&quot; (they were attacked by ants), Jethro got a &quot;lifesaving badge&quot;.

Misunderstandings were a general source of humor in the program: when the Clampetts did not understand something they had never encountered before (such as a water faucet), or when various city dwellers could not comprehend something the Clampetts were talking about. A group of businessmen overheard Jed talking about &quot;[[crayfish|crawdad]]s&quot; and concluded that he was discussing a new type of military vehicle, which they wanted to invest in. Conversely, when Jed muses to Mr. Brewster about whether he can afford to move to Beverly Hills, Brewster responds with, &quot;Why, Mr. Clampett, with your money, you could afford the [[Taj Mahal]],&quot; to which Jed rejoins, &quot;I'll take it!&quot; When Brewster insists he was making a joke; Jed allows that he can go right ahead. Brewster: &quot;Well, that was the joke.&quot; Jed: &quot;Mr. Brewster, you're an awfully nice feller, but I've heard a sight better jokes than that!&quot;

The Clampetts went back to the hills for Christmas during the first season but did not return there until the eighth season, during which several episodes were filmed on location in [[Kimberling City, Missouri]]. During this period, Shug Fisher and Elvia Allman joined the cast as Shorty and Elverna (Allman had appeared on an episode in the first season playing the same character).

One constant throughout the series was that the Hillbillies, who were scrupulously honest, were surrounded by cynical, conniving and money-hungry &quot;city-folk,&quot; whose plans were always foiled (usually unknowingly) by the Clampetts.

== Merchandise ==
The 1960s saw a plethora of tie-in merchandise hit store shelves, particularly toys. Several different coloring books and jigsaw puzzles were released, as was a fairly long-running comic book. There were even Hillbillies Halloween costumes. A ''Beverly Hillbillies'' [[lunchbox]] is among the most valuable pieces of memorabilia from the era.

''The Beverly Hillbillies'' made the cover of ''[[TV Guide]]'' nine times between 1962 and 1970. Donna Douglas is the only cast member pictured on every cover. Donna Douglas was also one of the most publicized actresses of the era, making the covers of many movie magazines.

In 1993, a 110-card set of ''Beverly Hillbillies'' [[trading cards]] was released by [[Eclipse Comics]]. Although timed to coincide with the release of the 1993 ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies (film)|Beverly Hillbillies]]'' film, these cards featured photos from the original television series, with storylines and character details on the back. An earlier card series from 1963 is highly sought by collectors and is among the most expensive non-sports cards sets.

==Reunions==
===1981 CBS TV movie===
In 1981, a ''Return of the Beverly Hillbillies'' [[television movie]], written and produced by series creator [[Paul Henning]], was aired on the CBS network. Irene Ryan had died in 1973, and Raymond Bailey had died in 1980. The script acknowledged Granny's passing but featured [[Imogene Coca]] as Granny's mother. Max Baer decided against reprising the role that both started and stymied his career, so the character of Jethro Bodine was given to another actor, [[Ray Young (actor)|Ray Young]].

The film's plot had Jed back in his old homestead in Bugtussle, having divided his massive fortune among Elly May and Jethro, both of whom stayed on the West Coast. Jane Hathaway had become a Department of Energy agent and was seeking Granny's &quot;White Lightnin'&quot; recipe to combat the [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis]]. Since Granny had gone on to &quot;her re-ward&quot;, it was up to Granny's centenarian &quot;Maw&quot; ([[Imogene Coca]]) to divulge the secret brew's ingredients. Subplots included Jethro playing an egocentric, starlet-starved Hollywood producer, Jane and her boss ([[Werner Klemperer]]) having a romance and Elly May owning a large petting zoo. The four main characters finally got together by the end of the story.

Having been filmed a mere decade after the final episode of the original series, viewer consensus was that the series' original spirit was lost to the film on many fronts, chief of which being the deaths of Ryan and Bailey and Baer's absence, which left only three of the six original cast members available to reprise their respective roles. Further subtracting from the familiarity was the fact that the legendary Clampett mansion was unavailable for a location shoot as the owners' lease was too expensive. Henning himself admitted sheer embarrassment when the finished product aired, blaming his inability to rewrite the script due to the 1981 [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=20 maart 2008 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxn4V6p1OYw |title=Paul Henning – Archive Interview Part 8 of 8 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Last Hillbilly Hurrah===
In 1993, Ebsen, Douglas, and Baer reunited onscreen for the only time in the [[CBS-TV]] retrospective television special, ''The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies'' which ranked as the 4th most watched television program of the week – a major surprise given the mediocre rating for the 1981 TV-movie. It was a rare tribute from the &quot;Tiffany network&quot; which owed much of its success in the 1960s to the series but has often seemed embarrassed by it in hindsight, often down-playing the show in retrospective television specials on the network's history and rarely inviting cast members to participate in such all-star broadcasts.

''The Legend of The Beverly Hillbillies'' special ignored several plot twists of the TV movie, notably Jethro was now not a film director but a leading Los Angeles physician. Critter-loving Elly May was still in California with her animals but Jed was back home in the Hills, having lost his fortune, stolen by the now-imprisoned banker Drysdale (a plot twist that many fans found unsettling for this good-natured show.) Nancy Kulp had died in 1991 and was little referred to beyond the multitude of film clips that dotted the special (which curiously failed to include a single film clip of Harriet MacGibbon.) The special was released on VHS tape by [[CBS/Fox Video]] in 1995 and as a bonus feature on The Official Third Season DVD Set in 2009.

==Reruns and syndication==
''The Beverly Hillbillies'' is still televised daily around the world in syndication. In the United States, the show is broadcast on [[TV Land]] and [[WGN America]]. A limited number of episodes from the earlier portions of the series run have turned up in the [[public domain]] and as such are seen occasionally on many smaller networks.

The show is distributed by [[CBS Television Distribution]], the syndication arm of [[CBS Paramount Television]]. The repeats of the show that debuted on [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS Daytime]] on September 5–9, 1966 as &quot;Mornin' Beverly Hillbillies&quot; through September 10, 1971 and on September 13–17, 1971 as &quot;The Beverly HILLBILLIES&quot; lasted up to Winter 1971–1972. It aired at 11:00–11:30am Eastern/10:00-10:30am Central through September 3, 1971, then moved to 10:30–11:00am Eastern/9:30-10:00am Central for the last season on CBS Daytime.

==Media==
===VHS and DVD releases===
Many episodes of the first two seasons of the series are in the [[public domain]] because CBS, having bought the rights to the series shortly after its cancellation, neglected to renew their copyrights. As a result, these episodes have been unofficially released on home video and DVD on many low-budget labels and shown on low-power television stations and low-budget networks in {{nowrap|16 mm}} prints. In many video prints of the public domain episodes, the original and much-loved theme music has been replaced by generic music due to copyright issues.

However, before his death, [[Paul Henning]], whose estate now holds the original film elements to the public domain episodes, authorized [[MPI Home Video]] to officially release the best of the first two seasons on DVD, the first &quot;ultimate collection&quot; of which was released in the fall of 2005. These collections include the original, uncut versions of the first season's episodes, complete with their original theme music and opening sponsor plugs. Vol. 1 has, among its bonus features, the alternate, un-aired version of the pilot film, ''The Hillbillies Of Beverly Hills'' (the version of the episode that sold the series to CBS), and the &quot;cast commercials&quot; (cast members pitching the products of the show's sponsors) originally shown at the end of each episode.

For many years, [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|20th Century Fox]], through a joint venture with CBS called [[CBS/Fox Video]], officially released select episodes of ''Hillbillies'' on videocassette. After [[Viacom]] merged with CBS, [[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]] (the video division of Paramount Pictures, which was acquired by Viacom in 1994) took over the video rights.

In 2006, Paramount announced plans to release the copyrighted episodes in boxed sets through [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS DVD]] later that year. The show's second season (consisting of the public domain episodes from that season) was released on DVD in Region 1 on October 7, 2008 as &quot;...The Official Second Season&quot;. The third season was released on February 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beverly-Hillbillies-Season-3/10886 |title=The Beverly Hillbillies DVD news: Announcement for The Beverly Hillbillies – The Official 3rd Season |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both seasons are available to be purchased together from major online retailers.

{{infobox beryllium}}
'''Beryllium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|b|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|l|i|əm}} {{respell|bə|RIL|ee-əm}}) is the [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Be''' and [[atomic number]] 4. It is a [[divalent]] element which only occurs naturally in combination with other elements in [[mineral]]s. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include [[beryl]] ([[Aquamarine (gemstone)|aquamarine]], [[emerald]]) and [[chrysoberyl]]. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle [[alkaline earth metal]].

It is primarily used as a hardening agent in [[alloy]]s, notably [[beryllium copper]]. Structurally, high [[flexural rigidity]], thermal stability, [[thermal conductivity]] and low density (1.85 times that of water) makes beryllium a quality [[aerospace]] material for high-speed [[aircraft]], [[missile]]s, [[space vehicle]]s and [[communication satellite]]s. Because of its low density and [[atomic mass]], beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays and other forms of [[ionizing radiation]]; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and in [[particle physics]] experiments.

The commercial use of beryllium metal presents technical challenges due to the [
