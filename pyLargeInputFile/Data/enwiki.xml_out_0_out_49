, [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]], [[Prong (band)|Prong]], and [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]]. While on tour, former vocalist [[Ozzy Osbourne]] announced his first retirement, and invited Black Sabbath to open for his solo band at the final two shows of his ''[[No More Tears|No More Tours]]'' tour in [[Costa Mesa, California|Costa Mesa]], California. The band agreed, aside from vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who said:

{{quote|I was told in the middle of the tour that we would be opening for Ozzy in Los Angeles. And I said, &quot;No. Sorry, I have more pride than that.&quot; A lot of bad things were being said from camp to camp, and it created this horrible schism. So by [the band] agreeing to play the shows in L.A. with Ozzy, that, to me, spelled out reunion. And that obviously meant the doom of that particular project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iommi &amp; Dio Interview&quot;/&gt;}}

Dio quit Black Sabbath following a show in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California on 13 November 1992, one night before the band were set to appear at Osbourne's retirement show. [[Judas Priest]] vocalist [[Rob Halford]] stepped in at the last minute, performing two nights with the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Henderson, Tim |url=http://www.bravewords.com/features/1000484 |title=Rob Halford Reminisces About Covering For OZZY! |publisher=BraveWords.com |accessdate=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iommi and Butler also joined Osbourne and former drummer [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]] on stage for the first time since 1985's ''[[Live Aid]]'' concert, performing a brief set of Black Sabbath songs.

=== ''Cross Purposes'' and ''Forbidden'' (1993–1996) ===
Drummer [[Vinny Appice]] left the band following the reunion show to join [[Ronnie James Dio]]'s solo band, later appearing on Dio's ''[[Strange Highways]]'' and ''[[Angry Machines]]''. Iommi and Butler enlisted former [[Rainbow (band)|Rainbow]] drummer [[Bobby Rondinelli]], and reinstated former vocalist [[Tony Martin (musician)|Tony Martin]]. The band returned to the studio to work on new material, again not originally intended to be released under the Black Sabbath name. As Geezer Butler explains:

{{quote|It wasn't even supposed to be a Sabbath album; I wouldn't have even done it under the pretence of Sabbath. That was the time when the original band were talking about getting back together for a reunion tour. Tony and myself just went in with a couple of people, did an album just to have, while the reunion tour was (supposedly) going on. It was like an Iommi/Butler project album.&lt;ref name = &quot;csidbi&quot;/&gt;}}

According to information though within Garry Sharpe-Young's books ''Black Sabbath: Never Say Die! 1979–1997'' and ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath: The Battle for Black Sabbath'', singer Tony Martin contradicts Butler's statements to this notion, claiming he even has Butler on audio and video boldly stating how pleased he was with the album's outcome, and how much fun he had in the studio creating a new Black Sabbath album.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Furthermore in Young's books pertaining to the ''Cross Purposes'' era, Bobby Rondinelli also is on record stating, &quot;No fucking way!  Tony Iommi asked me to join BLACK SABBATH!&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Under pressure from their record label, the band released their seventeenth studio album, ''[[Cross Purposes]]'', on 8 February 1994, under the Black Sabbath name. The album again received mixed reviews, with ''Blender'' giving the album two stars, calling [[Soundgarden]]'s 1994 album ''[[Superunknown]]'' &quot;a far better Sabbath album than this by-the-numbers potboiler&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Mitchell, Ben |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2226 |title=Blender Cross Purposes Review |publisher=Blender.com |accessdate=18 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allmusic's Bradley Torreano called ''Cross Purposes'' &quot;the first album since ''Born Again'' that actually sounds like a real Sabbath record&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Torreano, Bradley |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r193158|pure_url=yes}} |title=AMG Cross Purposes Review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album just missed the Top 40 in the UK reaching number 41, and also reached 122 on the ''Billboard 200'' in the US. ''Cross Purposes'' contained the song &quot;Evil Eye&quot;, which was co-written by [[Van Halen]] guitarist [[Eddie Van Halen]], although uncredited because of record label restrictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot;/&gt; Touring in support of ''Cross Purposes'' began in February with [[Morbid Angel]] and [[Motörhead]] in the US. The band filmed a live performance at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] on 13 April 1994, which was released on VHS accompanied by a CD, entitled ''[[Cross Purposes Live]]''. After the European tour with [[Cathedral]] and [[Godspeed (band)|Godspeed]] in June 1994, drummer Bobby Rondinelli quit the band and was replaced by original Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward for five shows in South America.

Following the touring cycle for ''Cross Purposes'', bassist Geezer Butler again quit the band. &quot;I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much preferred the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;csidbi&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler formed a solo project called [[GZR]], and released ''[[Plastic Planet]]'' in 1995. The album contained the song &quot;Giving Up the Ghost&quot;, which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: ''You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Butler's departure, newly returned drummer [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]] once again left the band. Iommi reinstated former members Neil Murray on bass, and Cozy Powell on drums, effectively reuniting the ''Tyr'' line-up. The band enlisted [[Body Count]] guitarist [[Ernie C]] to produce the new album, which was recorded in London in the fall of 1994. The album featured a guest vocal on &quot;Illusion of Power&quot; by Body Count vocalist [[Ice-T]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting ''[[Forbidden (Black Sabbath album)|Forbidden]]'', was released on 8 June 1995, but failed to chart in the US or the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&amp;model.vnuArtistId=4105&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=545105 |title=Billboard Black Sabbath album chart history |work=Billboard  |accessdate=20 March 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080603093537/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&amp;model.vnuArtistId=4105&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=545105 |archivedate = 3 June 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com |title=Every Hit.com UK Black Sabbath album chart history |publisher=EveryHit.com |accessdate=20 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was widely panned by critics; Allmusic's Bradley Torreano said &quot;with boring songs, awful production, and uninspired performances, this is easily avoidable for all but the most enthusiastic fan&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Torreano, Bradley |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r220255|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic Forbidden review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=20 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Blender'' magazine called ''Forbidden'' &quot;an embarrassment ... the band’s worst album&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mitchell, Ben |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2230m |title=Blender Forbidden review |publisher=Blender.com |accessdate=20 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Sabbath embarked on a world tour in July 1995 with openers [[Motörhead]] and [[Tiamat]], but two months into the tour, drummer Cozy Powell left the band, citing health issues, and was replaced by former drummer [[Bobby Rondinelli]]. After completing Asian dates in December 1995, Tony Iommi put the band on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with former Black Sabbath vocalist [[Glenn Hughes]], and former [[Judas Priest]] drummer [[Dave Holland (drummer)|Dave Holland]]. The album was not officially released following its completion, although a widely traded bootleg called ''Eighth Star'' surfaced soon after. The album was officially released in 2004 as ''[[The 1996 DEP Sessions]]'', with Holland's drums re-recorded by session drummer [[Jimmy Copley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r710201|pure_url=yes}} |title=AMG ''The 1996 DEP Sessions'' Review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Tony Iommi disbanded the current line-up to officially reunite with Ozzy Osbourne and the original Black Sabbath line-up. Vocalist Tony Martin claimed that an original line-up reunion had been in the works since the band's brief reunion at Ozzy Osbourne's 1992 Costa Mesa show, and that the band released subsequent albums to fulfill their record contract with I.R.S. records. Martin later recalled ''Forbidden'' as a &quot;filler album that got the band out of the label deal, rid of the singer, and into the reunion. However I wasn’t privy to that information at the time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonymartin.net/qanda.html |title=Tony Martin.net Q&amp;A |publisher=TonyMartin.net |accessdate=20 March 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071221032549/http://www.tonymartin.net/qanda.html |archivedate = 21 December 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[I.R.S.

=== Osbourne Reunion (1997–2006) ===
[[Image:Ozzy Osbourne.JPG|thumb|right|175px|Ozzy Osbourne in 2007.]]

In the summer of 1997, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Ozzy Osbourne officially reunited to co-headline the [[Ozzfest]] festival tour along side Osbourne's solo band. The line-up featured Osbourne's drummer [[Mike Bordin]] filling in for Bill Ward, who was unable to participate because of previous commitments with his solo project, The Bill Ward Band.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt; In December 1997, the group was joined by Ward, marking the first reunion of the original four members since Osbourne's 1992 &quot;retirement show&quot;. The original line-up recorded two shows at the [[National Exhibition Centre|Birmingham NEC]], which were released as the double live album ''[[Reunion (Black Sabbath album)|Reunion]]'' on 20 October 1998. ''Reunion'' reached number eleven on the ''Billboard 200'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Albums&quot;/&gt; and went platinum in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=&amp;artist=BLACK%20SABBATH&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=on&amp;before=on&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=2&amp;startYear=1999&amp;endYear=1999&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25 |title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database-''Reunion''|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album spawned the single &quot;[[Iron Man (song)|Iron Man]]&quot;, which won Black Sabbath its first and only [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] award in 2000 for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]], 30 years after the song was originally released. ''Reunion'' also featured two new studio tracks, &quot;Psycho Man&quot; and &quot;Selling My Soul&quot;, both of which cracked the top 20 on the ''Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks'' chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Albums&quot;/&gt;

Shortly before the band embarked on a European tour in the summer of 1998, drummer Bill Ward suffered a heart attack and was temporarily replaced by former drummer [[Vinny Appice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=68263 |title=HEAVEN AND HELL Drummer: RONNIE JAMES DIO Is 'Singing Better Than He Has Ever Sung'|publisher=Blabbermouth.net |accessdate=8 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ward returned in time for the US tour with openers [[Pantera]], which began in January 1999 and continued through the summer, headlining the annual Ozzfest tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt; Following the Ozzfest appearances, the band was put on hiatus while members worked on solo material. Tony Iommi released his first official solo album, ''[[Iommi (album)|Iommi]]'', in 2000, while Osbourne continued work on his next solo release, ''[[Down to Earth (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Down to Earth]]''.

Black Sabbath returned to the studio to work on new material with all four original members and producer [[Rick Rubin]] in the spring of 2001,&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt; but the sessions were halted when Osbourne was called away to finish tracks for his solo album in the summer of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Saraceno, Christina |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/articles/story/5932210/sabbath_scrap_disturbed_dates |title=Sabbath Scrap Disturbed Dates |work=Rolling Stone  |accessdate=8 April 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080617164614/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/articles/story/5932210/sabbath_scrap_disturbed_dates |archivedate = 17 June 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;It just came to an end&quot;, Iommi said. &quot;We didn't go any further, and it's a shame because &lt;nowiki&gt;[the songs]&lt;/nowiki&gt; were really {{nowrap|good&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blabbermouth Iommi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=25029 |title=BLACK SABBATH Guitarist Says It's A 'Shame' The Band Didn't Complete New Studio Album |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |accessdate=8 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Iommi commented on the difficulty getting all of the band members together to work on material:

{{quote|It's quite different recording now. We've all done so much in between. In &lt;nowiki&gt;[the early]&lt;/nowiki&gt; days there was no mobile phone ringing every five seconds. When we first started, we had nothing. We all worked for the same thing. Now everybody has done so many other things. It's great fun and we all have a good chat, but it's just different, trying to put an album together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blabbermouth Iommi&quot;/&gt;}}

In March 2002, Ozzy Osbourne's [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] winning reality TV show ''[[The Osbournes]]'' debuted on MTV, and quickly became a worldwide hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt; The show introduced Osbourne to a broader audience and to capitalise, the band's back catalogue label, [[Sanctuary Records Group|Sanctuary Records]] released a double live album ''[[Past Lives (album)|Past Lives]]'', which featured concert material recorded in the '70s, including the previously unofficial ''[[Live at Last (Black Sabbath album)|Live at Last]]'' album. The band remained on hiatus until the summer of 2004 when they returned to headline Ozzfest 2004 and 2005.

===''The Dio Years'' and Heaven &amp; Hell (2006–2010)===
{{details|Heaven &amp; Hell (band)}}

[[Image:Vinny Appice HAH Katowice Spodek 2007.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Vinny Appice performing a drum solo with Heaven &amp; Hell at [[Spodek]] in [[Katowice]] on 20 June 2007]]
While Ozzy Osbourne was working on [[Black Rain (Ozzy Osbourne album)|new solo album]] material in 2006, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] released ''[[Black Sabbath: The Dio Years]]'', a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring [[Ronnie James Dio]]. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. ''The Dio Years'' was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the ''Billboard 200'', while the single &quot;The Devil Cried&quot; reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Albums&quot;/&gt; Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the ''Heaven and Hell'' era line-up for a [[Heaven and Hell 2007 Tour|world tour]]. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves [[Heaven &amp; Hell (band)|Heaven &amp; Hell]], after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. Drummer [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]] was initially set to participate, but dropped out before the tour began due to musical differences with &quot;a couple of the band members&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=135471|title=Ward On Quitting Heaven &amp; Hell: I Was Uncomfortable With Some Things Surrounding The Project|last=Russell|first=Tom|date=20 February 2010|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net|Blabbermouth]]|accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was replaced by former drummer [[Vinny Appice]], effectively reuniting the line-up that had featured on the ''Mob Rules'' and ''Dehumanizer'' albums.

Heaven &amp; Hell toured the US with openers [[Megadeth]] and [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], and recorded a live album and DVD in New York on 30 March 2007, entitled ''[[Live from Radio City Music Hall]]''. In November 2007, Dio confirmed that the band had plans to record a new studio album,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Elliott, Mike |url=http://www.komodorock.com/interviews/interviews/komodo-rock-talks-with-ronnie-james-dio-200711012460/ |title=Komodo Rock Talks With Ronnie James Dio |publisher=Komodorock.com |accessdate=8 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was recorded in the following year. In April 2008 the band announced the upcoming release of a new box set and their participation in The [[Metal Masters Tour]], alongside [[Judas Priest]], [[Motörhead]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=95359 |title=JUDAS PRIEST Frontman On 'Metal Masters' Tour: 'We Insisted On A Classic Metal Package' |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |accessdate=25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The box set, ''[[The Rules of Hell]]'', featuring remastered versions of all the Dio fronted Black Sabbath albums, was supported by the Metal Masters Tour.

In March 2010, Black Sabbath announced that along with [[Metallica]] they would be releasing a limited edition single together to celebrate [[Record Store Day]].

On 26 May 2009 Osbourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name. Iommi noted that he has been the only band member for the full forty one years of the band, and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band. Although, in the suit, Osbourne is seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he has said that he hopes the proceedings will lead to equal ownership among the four original members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink= | title=Ozzy Osbourne sues over Black Sabbath name Accuses bandmate Tony Iommi of costing him merchandise royalties | date=30 May 2009 | agency=Associated Press | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31008866/ |publisher=MSNBC | accessdate =30 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Talks of original line-up reunion (2010) ===
In a January 2010 interview while promoting his biography ''[[I Am Ozzy]]'', Osbourne has stated that although he is not ruling out a reunion, he is doubtful there will be a reunion with all original members. Osbourne states &quot;I'm not gonna say I've written [a reunion] out forever, but right now I don't think there is any chance. But who knows what the future holds for me? If it's my destiny, fine.&quot; Osbourne compares it to going back to an ex-girlfriend, stating, &quot;I had girlfriends when I was younger and I would go, 'Oh, I would really like to go back with Shirley,' and then you do and you go to yourself, 'What the fuck was I thinking?'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink= | title=Ozzy: Sabbath not regrouping	 | date=25 January 2010 | agency=Associated Press | url =http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2010/01/25/12611346-wenn-story.html | work=Canoe | accessdate =25 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, Osbourne commented on the possibility of an original line-up Black Sabbath reunion, and that a new Black Sabbath album is a possibility before Osbourne retires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2010/08/12/black-sabbath-reunion-could-go-down-within-the-next-two-years/|title=Black Sabbath Reunion Could Go Down Within The Next Two Years|date=12 August 2010|publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]]|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he would do it on one condition: if &quot;[[Geezer Butler|Geezer]] will stop moaning.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/10/nov/06Ozzy_Up_For_Black_Sabbath_Reunion_On_One_Condition.shtml|title=Ozzy Up For Black Sabbath Reunion...

According to Geezer Butler, there will be no Black Sabbath reunion with Osbourne in 2011, as Osbourne will be touring with his solo band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/geezer-butler-no-black-sabbath-reunion-in-2011/ Metal Hammer » Blog Archive » Geezer Butler: No Black Sabbath Reunion In 2011&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January, Osbourne said that he and his former bandmates are in the talking process of possible reunion and a studio album but nothing is definite yet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=152709 BLABBERMOUTH.NET – OZZY Says Original BLACK SABBATH Members Are Talking About Possible Reunion, Studio Album&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 12 February, Geezer Butler said in his website: &quot;that there will be definitely NO reunion of all four original members of Black Sabbath, whether to record an album or to tour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geezerbutler.com/archives/462 Black Sabbath Statement :: The Official Geezer Butler Website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical style ==
Although Black Sabbath have gone through many line-ups and stylistic changes, their original sound focused on ominous lyrics and doomy music,&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Sabbath's song review&quot; /&gt; often making use of the musical [[tritone]], also called the &quot;devil's interval&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Satanism today&quot; /&gt; Standing in stark contrast to popular music of the early 1970s, Black Sabbath's dark sound was dismissed by rock critics of the era.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot; /&gt; Much like many of their early [[Traditional heavy metal|heavy metal]] contemporaries, the band received virtually no airplay on rock radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=D.

Fisher, Paul |title=Controversies of the music industry |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2001 |pages=87–88 |chapter=Messages of Death |isbn=0313310947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the band's primary songwriter, Tony Iommi wrote the majority of Black Sabbath's music, while Osbourne would write vocal melodies, and bassist Geezer Butler would write lyrics. The process was sometimes frustrating for Iommi, who often felt pressured to come up with new material. &quot;If I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen76&quot;/&gt; On Iommi's influence, Osbourne later said:

{{quote|Black Sabbath never used to write a structured song. There'd be a long intro that would go into a jazz piece, then go all folky... and it worked.

Early Black Sabbath albums feature [[guitar tunings|tuned-down]] guitars, which contributed to the dark feel of the music.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt; In 1966, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi suffered an accident while working in a [[sheet metal]] factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to [[Django Reinhardt]], a [[jazz]] guitarist who lost the use of two fingers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen135&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingers. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his [[prosthesis]], a move which inadvertently gave the music a darker feel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen135&quot;/&gt;
Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different [[Guitar tunings#Dropped tunings|dropped tunings]], including C# tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E♭/D# tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.&lt;ref name=inter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iommi.com/images/spread.jpg|title=Tony Iommi interview|accessdate=1 March 2009}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Black Sabbath has been so influential in the development of heavy metal rock music as to be a defining force in the style. The group took the blues-rock sound of late '60s acts like [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Blue Cheer]], and [[Vanilla Fudge]] to its logical conclusion, slowing the tempo, accentuating the bass, and emphasising screaming guitar solos and howled vocals full of lyrics expressing mental anguish and macabre fantasies. If their predecessors clearly came out of an electrified blues tradition, Black Sabbath took that tradition in a new direction, and in so doing helped give birth to a musical style that continued to attract millions of fans decades later.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;/&gt; }}

Sabbath were also one of the earliest to turn [[Gothic rock|gothic music]] into a genre.&lt;ref&gt;Scaruffi 2003, pg. 105, &quot;''Black Sabbath (2), a highly influential band, further deteriorated the degree of skills required for playing hard-rock, but their distorted and booming riffs, their monster grooves, their martial rhythms, their monotonous singing and their horror themes, that evoked the vision of a futuristic medieval universe, laid the foundations for black metal and doom-metal. Melody and any instrumental prowess were negligible components of their most typical works, Paranoid (1971) and Master of Reality (1971). They were not the inventors of gothic music, but they were the first to turn it into a genre.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally, Black Sabbath have exerted a huge influence in both television and literature and have in many cases become synonymous with heavy metal. In the film ''[[Almost Famous]]'', [[Lester Bangs]] gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band (plot point one) with the immortal line: 'Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath'. Contemporary music and arts publication ''Trebuchet Magazine'' has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece (500 words) on Black Sabbath as a means of proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/index.php/site/article/honest_and_unmerciful_writers_on_black_sabbath/ Honest and Unmerciful: Writers on Black Sabbath | Culture | Trebuchet Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bills began competitive play in 1960 as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] and joined the NFL as part of the [[AFL–NFL merger|AFL-NFL merger]] in 1970.

The Bills won two consecutive American Football League titles in 1964 and 1965, but the club has not won a league championship since then. Buffalo is also the only team to win four consecutive [[AFC Championship Game|American Football Conference Championships]], the only team in either conference to play in four consecutive [[Super Bowl]] games, and the only team ever to lose four consecutive [[Super Bowl]]s. 

The Bills were named as the result of the winning entry in a local contest, which named the team after the [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|AAFC Buffalo Bills]], a previous football franchise from the [[All-America Football Conference]] that merged with the [[Cleveland Browns]] in 1950. That team, in turn, was named after [[Buffalo Bill|William Frederick &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody]].  The Bills' cheerleaders are known as the [[Buffalo Jills]]. The official mascot is [[Billy Buffalo]]; Cody is not used in the team's iconography at all.

The Bills conduct summer training camp at [[St. John Fisher College]] in Pittsford, New York, a suburb of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]].

They are the only NFL team to play their home games within [[New York]] state. Both the [[New York Jets]] and the [[New York Giants]] play in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], nine miles outside of their headquarters in [[New York City]]. The Bills actually play their home games further away (11 miles) from their headquarters in the city of Buffalo. On October 2, 2005, the Bills played the [[New Orleans Saints]] in the first NFL regular-season game held in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. With the inception of the 5-year [[Bills Toronto Series]] deal in 2008 that is good through 2012, they are also the only team to play a home game in [[Canada]].

[[Image:BuffaloBillsOldLogo.png|right|thumb|The Bills logo from 1962 to 1973; still used as an alternate logo today.]] 
In 1962, the standing red bison was designated as the logo and took its place on a white helmet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hometown.aol.com/bkbubco/60-Buf.html |title=Elbert Dubenion - 1960 |publisher=Hometown.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}{{Verify credibility|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the team's colors also changed to red, white, and blue. The team switched to blue jerseys with red and white stripes on the shoulders. the helmets were white with a red center stripe.&lt;ref&gt;http://hometown.aol.com/bkbubco/62-Buf.html{{Dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1965, red and blue center stripes were put on the helmets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hometown.aol.com/bkbubco/65-Buf.html Billy Shaw &amp; Tom Sestak - 1965]{{Dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bills introduced blue pants worn with the white jerseys in 1973, the last year of the standing buffalo helmet. The blue pants remained through 1985. The face mask on the helmet was blue from 1974 through 1986 before changing to white. Buffalo sporadically wore white at home in the 1980s, but has not since 1986.

In 1974, the standing bison logo was replaced by a blue charging one with a red slanting stripe streaming from its horn. In 1984, the helmet's background color was changed from white to red, reportedly in part to distinguish them more readily from three of their division rivals at that time, the [[Indianapolis Colts]], the [[Miami Dolphins]], and the [[New England Patriots]], who all also wore white helmets at that point. (The Patriots now use a silver helmet, the Colts have since been realigned to the [[AFC South]], and the [[New York Jets]], who wore white helmets until [[1978 NFL season|1978]], have since switched back to white helmets.) 

In 2002, under the direction of general manager [[Tom Donahoe]], the Bills' uniforms went through  radical changes. A darker shade of blue was introduced as the main jersey color, and nickel gray was introduced as an accent color. Both the blue and white jerseys feature red side panels. The white jerseys include a dark blue shoulder yoke and royal blue numbers.  The current helmet is red with one navy blue, two nickel, two royal blue, two white stripes, and white face mask. A new logo, a stylized B consisting of two bullets and a more detailed buffalo head on top, was proposed and had been released (it can be seen on a few baseball caps that were released for sale), but fan backlash led to the team retaining the running bison logo. The current helmet logo adopted in 1974- a charging royal blue bison, with a red streak, white horn and eyeball- remains unchanged.

In 2005, the Bills revived the standing bison helmet and uniform of the mid-1960s as a throwback uniform.

The Bills usually wear the all-blue combination at home and the all-white combination on the road when not wearing the throwback uniforms. They have not worn blue on white since 2006, while the white on blue has not been worn since 2007.

On February 9, 2011, the Bills announced in a news release that they will be re-designing the uniforms for the 2011 season. The new uniforms, which will keep the &quot;charging buffalo&quot; logo, will be revealed at an upcoming fan appreciation event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/bills-nfl/article336833.ece |title=Bills plan new uniforms |publisher=Buffalo News |date= |accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in late April, a Madden 12 preview video showed a brief shot of the Bills' new uniforms. According to a source within the Bills organization, the uniforms are modeled after the late 1970's-early 1980's uniforms and will see the Bills return to white helmets full-time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2011/02/10/exclusive-details-on-the-new-bills-uniforms/&lt;/ref&gt;

* 12 Jim Kelly, QB, 1986&amp;ndash;96&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nflteamhistory.com/nfl_teams/buffalo_bills/retired_numbers.html Buffalo Bill Retired Numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unofficially retired'''
*32 O.J. Simpson, RB, 1969&amp;ndash;77
*34 Thurman Thomas, RB, 1988&amp;ndash;99
*78 Bruce Smith, DE, 1985&amp;ndash;99 ''(although guard [[Ruben Brown]] used 78 as his practice jersey; he wore 79 on the field)''

Since the earliest days of the team, the number 31 was not supposed to be issued to any player. The Bills had stationery and various other team merchandise showing a running player wearing that number, and it was not supposed to represent any specific person, but the 'spirit of the team.' The tradition was broken in 1969 when reserve running back [[Preston Ridlehuber]] was issued number 31 for one game while his normal number 36 jersey was repaired by equipment manager Tony Marchitte. The number 31 was not issued again until 1990 when first round draft choice James (J.D.) Williams wore it for his first two seasons. The number has since been released for use by any player and is currently being worn by starting free safety [[Jairus Byrd]].

The [[Buffalo Bills Radio Network]] is currently flagshipped at [[WGRF]] 96.9 FM, with games also available on [[WEDG]] 103.3FM. [[John Murphy (announcer)|John Murphy]] is the team's current [[Sports commentary|play-by-play]] announcer; he was a [[color commentator]] alongside, and eventually succeeded, longtime voice [[Van Miller]] after Miller's retirement at the end of the [[2003 NFL season]]. [[Mark Kelso]] serves as the color analyst. The Bills radio network has over twenty affiliates in [[upstate New York]] and one affiliate, [[CJCL]] 590AM (The Fan) in [[Toronto]].

Buffalo is one of eight teams that is contracted with [[Compass Media Networks]] to syndicate selected games nationwide.

During the preseason, most games are televised on Buffalo's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, [[WKBW-TV]] channel 7, with several other affiliates in [[western New York]]. These games are simulcast on sister stations [[WTVH]] in Syracuse, [[WICU-TV|WICU]] in Erie, [[WHAM-TV]] in Rochester, and beginning in 2008, [[CITY-TV]] in Toronto.  [[Ray Bentley]], a former Bills linebacker and current ''[[Arena Football League on ESPN|AFL on ESPN]]'' analyst, does play by play, while CBS analyst and former Bills special teams player [[Steve Tasker]] does color commentary on these games. WHAM-TV sports anchor [[Mike Catalana]] is the sideline reporter. Since 2008, preseason games have been broadcast in [[High-definition television|high definition]].

In the event that regular season (or preseason) games are broadcast by a cable outlet ([[ESPN]] or [[NFL Network]]), WKBW-TV carries the ESPN or NFL Network feed.

==Mascots, cheerleaders and marching band==
The Bills' official mascot is [[Billy Buffalo]], an eight-foot tall, anthropomorphic blue [[American bison]] who wears the jersey number BB.

The Bills' cheerleaders are known as the [[Buffalo Jills]]. The Jills are not owned by the Bills, but instead are a separate organization funded primarily by the [[Buffalo Bills Radio Network]], a subsidiary of [[Citadel Broadcasting]].

The Attica High School Marching Band is the official [[marching band]] of the Buffalo Bills. Along with the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[Washington Redskins]], the Bills are one of only three teams in the NFL to designate an official marching band. The Marching Band performs yearly pregame.

==In popular culture==
In the 1996 ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' episode &quot;[[Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man]]&quot;, the titular character, a member of a shadowy government cabal, states that the Buffalo Bills will not win a Super Bowl while he lives. Also on the X-Files during the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first season]] on the episode &quot;Roland&quot;, in the background you can see a Buffalo Bills poster hanging on the wall, with former Bills Running Back [[O.J.

The Buffalo Bills were featured on the direct-to-TV movie, ''[[Second String (Film)|Second String]]'' and in the [[Vincent Gallo]] drama ''[[Buffalo 66]]''.

The Bills are mentioned by rapper Gudda Gudda in a piece entitled &quot;Break Up&quot; along with artists Lil Wayne and Short Dogg. The lyric states &quot;All about my Bills like Buffalo.&quot;

The '''Central Artery/Tunnel Project''' ('''CA/T'''), known unofficially as the '''Big Dig''' and as the '''Big Dug''' since completion, was a [[megaproject]] in [[Boston]] that rerouted the [[Central Artery]] ([[Interstate 93]]), the chief [[highway]] through the heart of the city, into a 3.5-mile (5.6-km) tunnel. The project also included the construction of the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]] (extending [[Interstate 90]] to [[Logan International Airport]]), the [[Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Charles River]], and the [[Rose Kennedy Greenway]] in the space vacated by the previous I-93 elevated roadway. Initially, the plan was also to include a [[North–South Rail Link|rail connection]] between Boston's two major train terminals. The project concluded on December 31, 2007, when the partnership between program manager [[Bechtel]]/[[Parsons Brinckerhoff]] and the [[Massachusetts Turnpike Authority]] ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;enddate&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Steve |last=LeBlanc |title=On December 31, It's Official: Boston's Big Dig Will Be Done |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2007-12-26 |accessdate=2007-12-26 |url=http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/25/AR2007122500600.html?nav=hcmoduletmv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===Origin===
[[Image:OnBostonsElevatedCentralArtery.agr.jpg|thumb|right|Traffic on the old, elevated Central Artery at mid-day.]]
This project was developed in response to traffic congestion on Boston's historically tangled streets, which were laid out long before the advent of the [[automobile]]. By mid-20th century, car traffic in the inner city was extremely congested, especially for north&amp;ndash;south trips. Commissioner of Public Works [[William F. Callahan|William Callahan]] pushed through plans for an elevated expressway, which eventually was constructed between the downtown area and the waterfront. This &quot;Central Artery&quot; (known officially as the [[John F. Fitzgerald]] Expressway) displaced thousands of residents and businesses, and physically divided the historical connection between the downtown and market areas and the waterfront. Governor [[John Volpe]] interceded in the 1950s to send the last section of the Central Artery underground, through the [[Dewey Square]] (or &quot;[[South Station (Boston)|South Station]]&quot;) [[Dewey Square Tunnel|Tunnel]]; while traffic moved somewhat better, the other problems remained. There was chronic congestion on the Central Artery (I-93), an elevated six-lane highway through the center of downtown Boston, which was, in the words of Pete Sigmund, &quot;like a funnel full of slowly-moving, or stopped, cars (and swearing motorists).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CEG&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Pete |last=Sigmund |url=http://cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&amp;headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project |title=Triumph, Tragedy Mark Boston's Big Dig Project |publisher=Construction Equipment Guide |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1959, the 1.5-mile-long (2.4&amp;nbsp;km) road section carried approximately 75,000 vehicles a day, but by the 1990s, this had grown to 190,000 vehicles a day. Traffic jams of 16 hours were predicted for 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTA&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/bigdig/projectbkg.aspx |title=The Big Dig - Project Background |publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built before strict federal [[Interstate Highway standards]] were developed during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] administration, the expressway was plagued by tight turns, an excessive number of entrances and exits, entrance ramps without merge lanes, and continually escalating vehicular loads. Local businesses again wanted relief, historians sought a reuniting of the waterfront with the city, and nearby residents desired removal of the matte green-painted elevated road, which mayor [[Thomas Menino]] called Boston's &quot;other [[Green Monster]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author=Associated Press | url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3769829 | title=Boston’s ‘Big Dig’ opens to public | publisher=MSNBC | date=December 20, 2003 | accessdate=2006-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] engineers Bill Reynolds and (eventual state Secretary of Transportation) [[Frederick P. Salvucci]] envisioned moving the whole expressway underground.

===Cancellation of the inner belt===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
[[Image:Boston CAT Project-construction view from air.jpeg|right|frame|[[Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]] over the Charles River under construction, looking north. The old elevated Central Artery crossing is to the right.]]
Another important motivation for the Big Dig in its final form was the abandonment of the Massachusetts Highway Department's intended expressway system through and around Boston. The Central Artery, as part of MassHighway's Master Plan of 1948, was originally planned to be the downtown Boston stretch of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]], and was signed as such; a bypass road called the Inner Belt (officially [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 695]]) was to pass around the downtown core to the west, through the neighborhood of [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]] and the cities of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]]. However, earlier controversies over impact of the Boston extension of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], particularly on the heavily populated neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts|Brighton]], and the large number of additional homes that would have had to be destroyed, led to [[freeway and expressway revolts|massive community opposition]] to both the Inner Belt and the Boston section of I-95.

Clearances for I-95 through the neighborhoods of Roxbury, [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts|Jamaica Plain]], and [[Roslindale, Boston, Massachusetts|Roslindale]] led to secession threats by [[Hyde Park, Massachusetts|Hyde Park]], Boston's southernmost neighborhood, and the neighborhood most recently added to the city, in 1912. By 1972, however, with only a minimum of work done on the I-95 right of way and none on the potentially massively disruptive Inner Belt, Governor [[Francis Sargent]] put a moratorium on highway construction within the [[Massachusetts Route 128|MA-128]] corridor, except for a short stretch of Interstate 93. In 1974 the remainder of the Master Plan was canceled, leaving Boston with a severely overstressed expressway system.

With ever-increasing traffic volumes funneled onto I-93 alone, the Central Artery became chronically gridlocked. The Sargent moratorium led to the rerouting of I-95 away from Boston around the MA-128 beltway and the
conversion of the cleared land in the southern part of the city into the Southwest Corridor linear park and a new right of way for the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] subway and [[Amtrak]]. Parts of the planned I-695 right of way remain unused and under consideration for future mass transit projects.

The original 1948 Master Plan included a Third Harbor Tunnel plan that was hugely controversial in its own right because it would have disrupted the Maverick Square area of East Boston. It was never built.

===Mixing of traffic===
A major reason for the all-day congestion was that the Central Artery carried not only north&amp;ndash;south traffic, but much east&amp;ndash;west traffic as well.  Boston's Logan Airport lies across [[Boston Harbor]] in [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston]], and before the Big Dig the only access from downtown was through the paired [[Callahan Tunnel|Callahan]] and [[Sumner Tunnel|Sumner]] tunnels.  Traffic on the major highways from west of Boston&amp;mdash;the Massachusetts Turnpike and Storrow Drive&amp;mdash;mostly traveled on portions of the Central Artery to reach these tunnels.  Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels involved short diversions onto city streets, increasing local congestion.

The final Big Dig plan, then, combined several projects&amp;mdash;the depression and improvement of the Central Artery, the construction of a third Harbor tunnel (now known as the Ted Williams Tunnel), and massive interchange improvements to the Massachusetts Turnpike and several other major routes in the area.  While only one net lane in each direction was added to the north&amp;ndash;south I-93, several new east&amp;ndash;west lanes were added to untangle the traffic.  East&amp;ndash;west traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond, with new exits in South Boston along the way.  Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.

===Mass transit===
A number of [[public transportation]] projects were included as part of an [[environmental mitigation]] for the Big Dig. The most expensive was the building of the Phase II [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] tunnel under [[Fort Point Channel]], done in coordination with Big Dig construction. Silver Line buses now use this tunnel and the Ted Williams Tunnel to link [[South Station]] and Logan Airport.

{{As of|2010}}, promised projects to restore the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] streetcar service to the [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]] in [[Jamaica Plain]], to extend the Green Line beyond [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]], and to connect the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue]] subway lines have not been completed.  The extension beyond Lechmere is in progress&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenlineextension.org/ Green Line Extension Project]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Red and Blue subway line connection is being designed;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eot.state.ma.us/redblue/ Red Line / Blue Line Connector]&lt;/ref&gt; the status of the Arborway Line is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arborway.org/ The Arborway Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another plan, the [[North-South Rail Link]] that would have connected North and South Stations (the major passenger train stations in Boston), was part of the original Big Dig but was ultimately dropped by the [[Michael Dukakis|Dukakis]] administration as an impediment to acquiring federal funding for the project.

==Early planning==
The project was conceived in the 1970s by the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]] to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery. The expressway separated downtown from the waterfront, and was increasingly choked with bumper-to-bumper traffic. Business leaders were more concerned about access to [[Logan Airport]], and pushed instead for a third harbor tunnel. In their second terms, [[Michael Dukakis]] (governor) and [[Fred Salvucci]] (secretary of transportation) came up with the strategy of tying the two projects together&amp;mdash;thereby combining the project that the business community supported with the project that they and the City of Boston supported.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Planning for the Big Dig as a project officially began in 1982, with environmental impact studies starting in 1983. After years of extensive lobbying for federal dollars, a 1987 public works bill appropriating funding for the Big Dig was passed by [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], but it was subsequently vetoed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] as being too expensive. When Congress [[Veto override|overrode]] his veto, the project had its green light and ground was first broken in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Dan McNichol and Andy Ryan, ''The Big Dig''. Silver Lining Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA), which had little experience in managing an undertaking of the scope and magnitude of the CA/T Project, hired a joint venture of Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff to provide preliminary designs, manage design consultants and construction contractors, track the project's cost and schedule, advise MTA on project decisions, and (in some instances) act as the MTA's representative. Eventually, MTA combined some of its employees with Bechtel/Parsons employees in an integrated project organization. This was intended to make management more efficient, but it hindered MTA's ability to independently oversee Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff because MTA and
Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff had effectively become partners in the project.&lt;ref&gt;OIG Testimony CC-2005-027, &quot;Impact of Water Leaks on the Central Artery/Tunnel Project and Remaining Risks&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obstacles==
In addition to these political and financial difficulties, the project faced several environmental and engineering obstacles.

The downtown area through which the tunnels were to be dug was largely landfill, and included existing subway lines as well as innumerable pipes and utility lines that would have to be replaced or moved. Tunnel workers encountered many unexpected geological and archaeological barriers, ranging from glacial debris to foundations of buried houses and a number of sunken ships lying within the reclaimed land.

The project received approval from state environmental agencies in 1991, after satisfying concerns including release of toxins by the excavation and the possibility of disrupting the homes of millions of rats, causing them to roam the streets of Boston in search of new housing. By the time the federal environmental clearances were delivered in 1994,&lt;ref name=&quot;Palmer&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| first=Thomas | last=Palmer | url=http://libraries.mit.edu/rotch/artery/boston_globe.htm#wins | title=State Wins Federal OK to Start River-Crossing Part of Artery Project | publisher=Boston Globe | date=1994-06-21 | accessdate=2007-12-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071105064639/http://libraries.mit.edu/rotch/artery/boston_globe.htm#wins &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the process had taken some seven years, during which time inflation greatly increased the project's original cost estimates.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Reworking such a busy corridor without seriously restricting traffic flow required a number of state-of-the-art construction techniques. Because the old elevated highway (which remained in operation throughout the construction process) rested on pylons located throughout the designated dig area, engineers first utilized [[slurry wall]] techniques to create {{convert|120|ft|m|abbr=on}}.-deep concrete walls upon which the highway could rest. These concrete walls also stabilized the sides of the site, preventing cave-ins during the excavation process.

The multi-lane interstates also had to pass under South Station's 7 tracks, which carried over 40,000 commuters and 400 trains per day. To avoid multiple relocations of train lines while the tunneling advanced, as had been initially planned, a specially designed [[jack (device)|jack]] was constructed to support the ground and tracks to allow the excavation to take place below. Construction crews also used [[Ground freezing]] to help stabilize surrounding ground as they excavated the tunnel. This was the largest tunneling project undertaken beneath railway lines anywhere in the world. The ground freezing enabled safer, more efficient [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]], and also assisted in environmental issues, as less contaminated fill needed to be exported than if a traditional [[Cut-and-cover tunnel|cut-and-cover method]] had been applied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;amp;id=3418 Boston Central Artery Jacked Tunnels - Mott MacDonald Project Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other challenges included an existing subway tunnel crossing the path of the underground highway. To build [[slurry wall]]s past this tunnel, it was necessary to dig beneath the tunnel and build an underground concrete bridge to support the tunnel's weight.

==Construction phase==
[[Image:Boston-big-dig-area.png|thumb|Construction sites of the &quot;Big Dig&quot;]]

The project was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, with the Big Dig and the Turnpike's Boston Extension from the 1960s being financially and legally joined by the legislature as the [[Metropolitan Highway System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm MGL Chapter 81A, Section 3.]&lt;/ref&gt; Design and construction was supervised by a joint venture of [[Bechtel Corporation]] and [[Parsons Brinckerhoff]]. Because of the enormous size of the project&amp;mdash;too large for any company to undertake alone&amp;mdash;the design and construction of the Big Dig were broken up into dozens of smaller subprojects with well-defined interfaces between contractors. Major heavy-construction contractors on the project included [[Jay Cashman]], [[Modern Continental]], [[Obayashi Corporation]], [[Perini|Perini Corporation]], [[Peter Kiewit Sons' Incorporated]], [[J.F. White]], and the Slattery division of [[Skanska]] USA. (Of those, Modern Continental was awarded the greatest gross value of contracts, joint ventures included.)

The nature of the Charles River crossing had been a source of major controversy throughout the design phase of the project. Many environmental advocates preferred a river crossing entirely in tunnels, but this, along with 27 other plans, was rejected as too costly. Finally, with a deadline looming to begin construction on a separate project that would connect the [[Tobin Bridge]] to the Charles River crossing, Salvucci overrode the objections and chose a variant of the plan known as &quot;Scheme Z&quot;. This plan was considered to be reasonably cost-effective, but had the drawback of requiring highway ramps stacked up as high as 100 feet (30&amp;nbsp;m) immediately adjacent to the Charles River.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-scheme z&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Caution: High bridge ahead; Artery plan includes an awful scheme for a great wall across the Charles|last=Campbell|first=Robert|date=June 24, 1990|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=2009-08-04|quote=The grotesque monstrosity that will be the new Central Artery requires a certain power of imagination to be grasped. Maybe that's why people are only now beginning to get upset about it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] objected to the visual impact of the chosen Charles River crossing design. It sued to revoke the project's environmental certificate and forced the project to redesign the river crossing again.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-cambridge&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cambridge sues to halt bridge plan|last=Palmer Jr|first=Thomas C.|date=March 12, 1995|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ZakimBridge20040307.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Leonard P. Zakim Bridge]]
Swiss Engineer [[Christian Menn]] took over the design of the bridge. He suggested a sleek, modern, [[cable-stayed bridge]] that would carry 10 lanes of traffic. The plan was accepted and construction began on the [[Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge]]. The bridge employed an asymmetrical design and a hybrid of steel and concrete was used to construct it. The distinctive bridge is supported by two forked towers connected to the span by cables and girders.  It was the first bridge in the country to employ this method and it is the widest cable-stayed bridge in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;CEG&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| first=Pete | last=Sigmund | url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&amp;headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project | title=Triumph, Tragedy Mark Boston's Big Dig Project | publisher=Construction Equipment Guide |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, construction continued on the Tobin Bridge approach. By the time all parties agreed on the I-93 design, construction of the Tobin connector (today known as the &quot;City Square Tunnel&quot; for a [[Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] area it bypasses) was far along, significantly adding to the cost of constructing the [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. 1]] interchange and retrofitting the tunnel.
&lt;!--Shift to active voice shortened this sentence a little, but it's still unclear whether the Rt1 work and tunnel retrofit were built, or were abandoned because of the increased cost.--&gt;

Boston blue [[clay]] and other soils extracted from the path of the tunnel were used to cap many local [[landfill]]s, fill in the [[Quincy Quarries Reservation|Granite Rail Quarry]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], and restore the surface of [[Spectacle Island (Massachusetts)|Spectacle Island]] in the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area]].

The [[Storrow Drive Connector]], a companion bridge to the Zakim, began carrying traffic from I-93 to Storrow Drive in 1999. The project had been under consideration for years, but was opposed by the wealthy residents of the Beacon Hill neighborhood. However, it finally was accepted because it would funnel traffic bound for Storrow Drive and downtown Boston away from the mainline roadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.bostonroads.com/crossings/zakim/ | title=Leonard P. Zakim-Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge | accessdate=2006-07-18 | publisher=BostonRoads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Connector ultimately used a pair of ramps that had been constructed for [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 695]], enabling the mainline I-93 to carry more traffic that would have used I-695 under the original Master Plan.

When construction began, the project cost, including the Charles River crossing, was estimated at $5.8 billion. Eventual [[cost overruns]] were so high that the chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, [[James Kerasiotes]], was fired in 2000. His replacement had to commit to an $8.55 billion cap on federal contributions. Total expenses eventually passed $15 billion. Interest brought this cost to $21.93 billion.

===Engineering methods and details===
[[Image:BigDigSupportsCentralArtery.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Temporary supports hold up elevated Central Artery during construction.]]
Several unusual engineering challenges arose during the project, requiring unusual solutions and methods to address them.

At the beginning of the project, engineers had to figure out the safest way to build the tunnel without endangering the existing elevated highway above. Eventually, they created horizontal braces as wide as the tunnel, then cut away the elevated highway's struts, and lowered it onto the new braces.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP 122507&quot;&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071225/ap_on_re_us/big_dig_the_end Boston's $14.8B Big Dig finally complete], By Steve LeBlanc, Associated Press, 12/25/07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final phases==
[[Image:Tunnel-large.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Interstate 93 Tunnel]]

On January 17, 2003, the opening ceremony was held for the I-90 Connector Tunnel, extending the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90) east into the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]], and onwards to Logan Airport. The Ted Williams tunnel had been completed and in limited use for commercial traffic and [[high-occupancy vehicle]]s since late 1995. The westbound lanes opened on the afternoon of January 18 and the eastbound lanes on January 19.

The next phase, moving the elevated Interstate 93 underground, was completed in two stages: northbound lanes opened in March 2003 and southbound lanes (in a temporary configuration) on December 20, 2003. A tunnel underneath Leverett Circle connecting eastbound Storrow Drive to I-93 North and the Tobin Bridge opened December 19, 2004, easing congestion at the circle. All southbound lanes of I-93 opened to traffic on March 5, 2005, including the left lane of the Zakim Bridge, and all of the refurbished Dewey Square Tunnel.

By the end of December 2004, 95% of the Big Dig was completed. Major construction remained on the surface, including construction of final ramp configurations in the [[North End, Boston, Massachusetts|North End]] and in the [[South Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|South Bay]] interchange, and reconstruction of the surface streets.

The final ramp downtown &amp;mdash; exit 20B from [[Interstate 93|I-93]] south to [[Albany Street (Boston)|Albany Street]] &amp;mdash; opened January 13, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Casey | last=Ross | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/969503741.html?dids=969503741:969503741&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jan+14%2C+2006&amp;author=CASEY+ROSS&amp;pub=Boston+Herald&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=009&amp;desc=Hallelujah+Hub+drivers!+Last+Big+Dig+ramp+done | title=Hallelujah Hub drivers!

In 2006, the two Interstate 93 tunnels were dedicated as the [[Tip O'Neill|Thomas &quot;Tip&quot; O'Neill]] [[Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel|Tunnel]], after the former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] speaker of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from Massachusetts who pushed to have the Big Dig funded by the federal government.

==Mitigation projects==

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}} &lt;!-- What are the non-MBTA mitigation requirements that haven't been met? --&gt;

{{For|more information about the public transit mitigation projects|Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority}}

Many environmental impact mitigation projects (transit, pedestrian, bicycle, and parks) also remain. Although these were legal requirements for approval of the environmental impact statement, many{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} are not funded because of the massive cost overruns on the highway portion of the project.  For example, though the [[North Point Park (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|North Point Park]] was created as part of the project, it ended without constructing pedestrian bridges to neighboring parks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

While not a legally mandated requirement, [[public art]] was part of the urban design planning process (and later design development work) through the Artery Arts Program. The intent of the program was to integrate public art into highway infrastructure (retaining walls, fences, and lighting) and the essential elements of the pedestrian environment (walkways, park landscape elements, and bridges). As overall project costs increased, the Artery Arts Program was seen as a potential liability, even though there was support and interest from the public and professional arts organizations in the area.

At the beginning of the highway design process, a temporary arts program was initiated and over 50 proposals were selected. However, development began on only a few projects before funding for the program was cut. Permanent public art that was funded includes: super graphic text and facades of former West End houses cast into the concrete elevated highway abutment support walls near North Station by artist [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]]; an historical sculpture about the 18th and 19th century shipbuilding industry and a bust of shipbuilder [[Donald McKay]] in East Boston; blue interior lighting of the Zakim Bridge; and the Miller's River Littoral Way walkway and lighting under the loop ramps north of the Charles River.

Extensive landscape planting, as well as a maintenance program to support the plantings, was requested by many community members during public meetings.

==Impact on traffic==
[[Image:ONeilltoZakimBridge.agr.jpg|thumb|Traffic exiting the Big Dig tunnel onto the Zakim Bridge.]]
Before the Big Dig, the Central Artery carried not only north&amp;ndash;south traffic but much east&amp;ndash;west traffic, a major cause of its all-day congestion.  The only direct access to Boston's Logan Airport from downtown was through the paired [[Callahan Tunnel|Callahan]] and [[Sumner Tunnel|Sumner]] tunnels under [[Boston Harbor]].  To reach these tunnels, traffic on the major highways from west of Boston&amp;mdash;the Massachusetts Turnpike and Storrow Drive&amp;mdash;traveled on portions of the Central Artery.  Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels also involved short stretches on city streets, increasing local congestion and causing backups on the highway.

The Big Dig untangled this co-mingled traffic.  While only one net lane in each direction was added to the north&amp;ndash;south I-93, several new east&amp;ndash;west lanes became available.  East&amp;ndash;west traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond.  Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels still uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.

The result was a 62% reduction in vehicle hours of travel on I-93, the airport tunnels, and the connection from Storrow Drive, from an average 38,200 hours per day before construction (1994–1995) to 14,800 hours per day in 2004–2005, after the project was largely complete.&lt;ref name=impactreport&gt;http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-6&lt;/ref&gt;  The savings for travelers was estimated at $166 million annually in the same 2004–2005 time frame.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  Travel times on the Central Artery northbound during the afternoon peak hour were reduced 85.6%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-1&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 ''Boston Globe'' report asserted that waiting time for the majority of trips actually increased as a result of [[induced demand|demand induced]] by the increased road capacity.  Because more drivers were opting to use the new roads, traffic bottlenecks were only pushed outward from the city, not reduced or eliminated (although some trips are now faster).  The report states, &quot;Ultimately, many motorists going to and from the suburbs at peak rush hours are spending more time stuck in traffic, not less.&quot;  The ''Globe'' also asserted that their analysis provides a fuller picture of the traffic situation than a state-commissioned study done two years ago, in which the Big Dig was credited with helping to save at least $167 million a year by increasing economic productivity and decreasing motor vehicle operating costs.  That study did not look at highways outside the Big Dig construction area and did not take into account new congestion elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Murphy | first=Sean | date=2008-11-16 | title=Big Dig pushes bottlenecks outward | work=Boston Globe | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/11/16/big_dig_pushes_bottlenecks_outward/ | accessdate=2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
===&quot;Thousands of leaks&quot;===
As far back as 2001, Turnpike Authority officials and private contractors knew of thousands of leaks in the ceiling and wall fissures, extensive water damage to steel supports and fireproofing systems, and overloaded drainage systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebostonchannel.com/bigdig/3924866/detail.html Report: Even More Big Dig Leaks Found - Big Dig News Story - WCVB Boston&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A $10 million contract, signed off as a [[cost overrun]], was used to repair these leaks. Many of the leaks were a result of Modern Continental and other subcontractors failing to remove gravel and other debris before pouring concrete. This was not made publicly known to the media, but engineers at MIT (volunteer students and professors) performed several experiments and found serious problems with the tunnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;evenmorebigleaks&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Report: Even More Big Dig Leaks Found | url=http://www.thebostonchannel.com/bigdig/3924866/detail.html | publisher=WCVB-TV | date=2004-11-17 | accessdate=2006-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2004, a major leak in the [[Interstate 93]] north tunnel forced the closure of the tunnel while repairs were conducted. This also forced the Turnpike Authority to release information regarding its non-disclosure of prior leaks. A follow-up reported on &quot;extensive&quot; leaks that were more severe than state authorities had previously acknowledged. The report went on to state that the $14.6 billion tunnel system was riddled with more than 400 leaks. A ''[[Boston Globe]]'' report, however, countered that by stating there were nearly 700 leaks in a single {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} section of tunnel beneath South Station. Turnpike officials also stated that the number of leaks being investigated was down from 1,000 to 500.&lt;ref name=&quot;evenmorebigleaks&quot; /&gt;

===Substandard materials===
[[Massachusetts State Police]] searched the offices of [[Aggregate Industries]], the largest concrete supplier for the underground portions of the project, in June 2005. They seized evidence that Aggregate delivered concrete that did not meet contract specifications. In May 2006, six employees of the company were arrested and charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. Immediately after the arrests, Massachusetts Governor [[Mitt Romney]] announced he would return $3,900 in political contributions from employees of Aggregate Industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.eyewitnessnewstv.com/Global/story.asp?S=4868505&amp;nav=F2DO | title=Romney to return contributions from Big Dig concrete workers | publisher=WPRI | accessdate=2006-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 19, 2006, the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' reported that [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] [[Thomas Reilly|Tom Reilly]] planned to sue [[Bechtel]]/[[Parsons Brinckerhoff]] and other companies because of poor work on the project. Over 200 complaints have been filed by the state of Massachusetts as a result of leaks, cost overruns, quality concerns, and safety violations. In total, the state is seeking approximately $100 million from the contractors ($1 for every $141 spent).&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters-StateWeighs&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/19/news/notes.php |title=State weighs suing 'Big Dig' contractors |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2006-03-20 |accessdate=2006-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatal ceiling collapse===
{{Main|Big Dig ceiling collapse}}

A fatal accident raised safety questions and closed part of the project for most of the summer of 2006. On July 10, 2006, a concrete ceiling panel weighing 3 tons (2722&amp;nbsp;kg) and measuring 20 by 40&amp;nbsp;ft (6.1 by 12.2 m) fell on a car traveling on the two-lane ramp connecting northbound I-93 to eastbound [[Interstate 90|I-90]] in [[South Boston]], killing Milena Del Valle, who was a passenger, and injuring her husband, Angel Del Valle, who was driving.&lt;ref name=&quot;CEG&quot;&gt;{{cite news url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&amp;headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project | publisher=Construction Equipment Guide | date=2007-06-06 | accessdate=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following the fatal ceiling collapse, Governor Mitt Romney ordered a stem-to-stern safety audit conducted by the Illinois engineering firm of [[Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.]] to look for additional areas of risk. Said Romney: &quot;We simply cannot live in a setting where a project of this scale has the potential of threatening human life, as has already been seen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2006/08/17/governor_names_ill_firm_to_lead_big_dig_audit/ | title=Governor names Ill. firm to lead Big Dig audit | work=Boston Globe | last=Mishra | first=Raja | date=2006-08-17 | accessdate=2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse and closure of the tunnel greatly snarled traffic in the city.

Following extensive inspections and repairs, Interstate 90 east-and westbound lanes reopened in early January 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeattlePi&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/1110AP_Big_Dig.html | title=Mass. tunnel ceiling inspections ordered| publisher=SeattlePi.com | date=2007-01-17 | accessdate=2006-01-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070713070649/http://www.seattlepi.com/national/1110AP_Big_Dig.html |archivedate = July 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final piece of the road network, a high occupancy vehicle lane connecting Interstate 93 north to the Ted Williams Tunnel, reopened on June 1, 2007.

On July 10, 2007, after a lengthy investigation, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] found that [[epoxy]] glue used to hold the roof in place during construction was not appropriate for long-term bonding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= http://www.ntsb.gov/Pressrel/2007/070710b.htm
| title=Safety Board Determines Cause of Boston's Big Dig Tunnel Ceiling Collapse Last Year| publisher=ntsb.gov | date=2007-10-05| accessdate=2006-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was determined to be the cause of the roof collapse. The Power-Fast Epoxy Adhesive used in the installation was designed for short-term loading, such as wind or earthquake loads, not long-term loading, such as the weight of a panel.&lt;ref name=Power-Fast&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.powers.com/product_08402.html | title =Power-Fast+ Epoxy Adhesive System| publisher=powers.com| accessdate=2007-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powers Fasteners, the makers of the adhesive, revised their product specifications on May 15, 2007 to increase the [[safety factor]] from 4 to 10 for all of their epoxy products intended for use in overhead applications. The safety factor on Power-Fast Epoxy was increased from 4 to 16.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power-Fast&quot;/&gt; On December 24, 2007, the Del Valle family announced they had reached a settlement with Power Fasteners that would pay the family $6 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;globe settlement&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/traffic/bigdig/articles/2007/12/24/settlement_reached_in_big_dig_death/?p1=Well_MostPop_Emailed1|title= Settlement reached in Big Dig death|publisher=[[Boston Globe]]|date=2007-12-24|accessdate=2007-12-25 | first=Megan | last=Woolhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, Power Fasteners agreed to pay $16 million to the state to settle manslaughter charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

{{Tanakh OT}}
The '''Books of Chronicles''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] '''Dibh're Hayyamim''', דברי הימים, [[Greek language|Greek]] '''Paralipomenon''', {{Polytonic|Παραλειπομένων}}) are part of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. In the [[Masoretic Text]], it appears as the first or last book of the [[Ketuvim]] (the latter arrangement also making it the final book of the Jewish bible). Chronicles largely parallels the [[David]]ic narratives in the [[Books of Samuel]] and the [[Books of Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], ''Understanding the Bible: 2nd Edition''. Mayfield: Palo Alto. 1985. p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Christian ordering, it is divided into two parts, 1 &amp; 2 Chronicles, immediately following 1 &amp; 2 Samuel and 1 &amp; 2 Kings as a summary of them with minor details sometimes added. The division of Chronicles and its place in the Christian canon of the Old Testament are based upon the [[Septuagint]].

==Name==
[[Image:Pray for Our Nation sign IMG 3291.JPG|200px|right|thumb|&lt;font size=2&gt;Citing 2 Chronicles 7:14, signs across [[rural]] [[Texas]] urge citizens to &quot;Pray for Our Nation&quot; (2010).&lt;/font size=2&gt;]]

In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] the book is called ''Divrei Hayyamim'' (i.e. &quot;the matters [of] the days&quot;), based on the phrases ''sefer divrei ha-yamim le-malkhei Yehudah'' and &quot;sefer divrei ha-yamim le-malkhei Israel&quot; (&quot;book of the days of the kings of Judah&quot; and &quot;book of the days of the kings of Israel&quot;), both of which appear repeatedly in the Books of Kings.  Chronicles was formerly presumed to represent the source-material whence [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] were composed; that is, the kings' official [[Logbook|Day-Books]], much like the U.S. ''[[Congressional Record]]'' of modern times.

In the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Septuagint]] (LXX), Chronicles bears the title ''Paralipomenon'' ({{Polytonic|Παραλειπομένων}}), i.e., &quot;that which has been left out or left to one side&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lit., &quot;body of things left on one side by itself&quot;—{{Polytonic|Παραλειπομένων}} being a collective ''genitive,'' neuter, plural participle.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Chronicles-[[Ezra-Nehemiah]] theory, it contains material set aside from the rest of the book of Ezra, which was canonized first.&lt;ref name=&quot;Recent Studies&quot;&gt;[http://cbi.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/8/1/10 Recent Studies in Chronicles].&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, scholars have theorized that these books were originally composed as one book by a single author, but later were split apart.  Although now debated, this theory has been the scholarly consensus for many centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Recent Studies&quot; /&gt;

Chronicles summarizes and reviews the deuteronomic history of the foregoing books, adding only minor details here and there, and therefore does not &quot;supplement&quot; the history to any noteworthy degree.

[[Jerome]], in the introduction to his [[Latin]] translation of the books of Samuel and Kings (part of the [[Vulgate]]), referred to the book as a ''chronikon'' (&quot;Chronicles&quot; in English). The book itself is titled ''Paralipomenon'' in the [[Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11472a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Japhet, Sara, ''I &amp; II Chronicles: A Commentary''. Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 1993. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
In the [[masoretic text]], Chronicles is part of the third part of the [[Tanakh]], namely the [[Ketuvim]] (&quot;Writings&quot;). In most printed versions it is the last book in Ketuvim (following Ezra-Nehemiah). This order is based on medieval [[Ashkenaz]]ic manuscripts. The order of the books of Ketuvim given in the [[Talmud]] (''Bava Batra'' 14b-15a), though it differs from the Ashkenazic order, also places Chronicles at the end of Ketuvim. In these traditions, Chronicles becomes the final book of the Bible. However, in early Tiberian manuscripts such as the [[Aleppo codex]] and the [[Leningrad codex]], Chronicles is placed as the first book in Ketuvim, preceding [[Psalms]].

The Jewish ordering of the canon suggests that Chronicles is a summary of the entire span of history to the time it was written. Such broad scope of the book may be the reason the Chronicler commences his genealogy with [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]. Steven Tuell argues that having Chronicles as the last book in the canon is appropriate since it &quot;attempts to distill and summarize the entire history of God's dealings with God's people.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Tuell, Steven S. ''First and Second Chronicles''. Louisville: John Knox Press, 2001. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian Bibles, Chronicles 1 and 2 are part of the Old Testament, following Kings and before [[Ezra]]. This order is based upon that found in the [[Septuagint]] and followed by the [[Vulgate]], since the material is historical and the narrative flows seamlessly into the book of Ezra.

==Contextual division==
Based on its contents, the book may be divided into four parts:
#The beginning of 1 Chronicles (chapters 1–10) mostly contains [[genealogy|genealogical]] lists, concluding with the House of [[Saul]] and Saul's rejection by God, which sets the stage for the rise of [[David (biblical king)|David]].
#The remainder of 1 Chronicles (chapters 11–29) is a history of David's reign.
#The beginning of 2 Chronicles (chapters 1–9) is a history of the reign of King [[Solomon]], son of David.
#The remainder of 2 Chronicles (chapters 10–36) is a chronicle of the kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] to the time of the [[Babylonian exile]], concluding with the call by [[Cyrus the Great]] for the exiles to return to their land.

However, it is also possible to divide the book into three parts rather than four by combining the sections treating David and Solomon, since they both ruled over a combined Judah and Israel, unlike the last section that contains the chronicle of the Davidic kings who ruled the [[Kingdom of Judah]] alone.

==Authorship and composition==
For over a century biblical scholars believed that Chronicles and the narrative portions of [[Ezra-Nehemiah]] came from the same author, but many scholars now believe this to be improbable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=rLFXnQ6b9v4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Tradition+and+transformation+in+the+book+of+Chronicles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0wKmarqZXD&amp;sig=vFrMiMbkQhMbRw_eZq3ahikMMdk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BauzTP-MDYzQcdmwteQI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Beentjes, Pancratius C., &quot;Tradition and transformation in the book of Chronicles&quot; (Brill, 2008)] p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The last events in Chronicles take place in the reign of [[Cyrus the Great]], the Persian king who conquered Babylon in 539 BCE; this sets an earliest possible date for the book. [[Martin Noth]] was of the opinion that it dated from the 3rd century BCE, and [[Gary N. Knoppers|Gary Knoppers]], while acknowledging that Chronicles theoretically could be written anywhere between 500 and 250 BCE, tends to see it as probably dating between 325 and 275 BCE. 

In its general scope and design, Chronicles is not so much historical as didactic.&lt;ref&gt;History debated: the historical reliability of Chronicles in pre-critical and critical research, Kai Peltonen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=QDwEOzTXvb8C&amp;pg=PA12 First and Second Chronicles], Paul K. Hooker, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Chronicler as historian, Matt Patrick Graham, Kenneth G. Hoglund, Steven L. McKenzie, Raymond B. Dillard, Society of Biblical Literature, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal aim of the writer appears to be to present moral and religious truth. He does not give prominence to political occurrences, as is done in the books of Samuel and Kings, but to religious institutions, such as the details of the temple service. The genealogies were an important part of the public records of the Hebrew state. They were the basis on which the land was distributed and held, and by which the public services of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|temple]] were arranged and conducted. The Chronicles are an epitome of the sacred history from the days of Adam down to the return from Babylonian exile, a period of about 3,500 years. The writer gathers up the threads of the old national life broken by the captivity.

The sources whence the chronicler compiled his work were public records, registers, and genealogical tables belonging to the Jews. These are referred to in the course of the book (1 Chr. 27:24; 29:29; 2 Chr. 9:29; 12:15; 13:22; 20:34; 24:27; 26:22; 32:32; 33:18, 19; 27:7; 35:25). There are in Chronicles, and the books of Samuel and Kings, forty parallels, often verbal, proving that the writer of Chronicles both knew and used those other books.

Additionally, though the Chronicler's principal source is the ''Deuteronomistic History'', coming primarily, as stated above, from the books of 2 Samuel and 1–2 Kings&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament (New York: Oxford, 2009), 361&lt;/ref&gt; and other public records and sources (see above), we{{Who|date=April 2011}} do see the Chronicler also using other biblical sources, particularly from the ''Pentateuch'', as redacted and put together by P.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, 2009. 361&quot;&gt;Coogan, 2009. 361&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the Chronicler's use of genealogies in 1 Chronicles 1-9, which seem to come directly from the Pentateuch and possibly, as well, from Joshua and other books.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, 2009. 361&quot;/&gt; There are in the Chronicles also many quotations from the Book of Psalms and occasional references from the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, 2009. 361&quot;/&gt; 
The Chronicler appears to use other works that we no longer possess from the Deuteronomistic historians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, 2009. 361&quot;/&gt; A typical example can be found in 2 Chronicles 9:29 and references the work ''Acts of Solomon'' and, additionally, several unknown prophets, such as Ahijah the Shilonite and the seer Ido.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, 2009. 361&quot;/&gt; And there are several non-biblical historically and archaeologically attested details that can only be found in Chronicles, including the account of the Egyptian Shistak's campaign in the late 10th century BCE (2 Chronicles 12:2–4), and Hezekiah's preparing and safeguarding Jerusalem's water supply prior to the Assyrian attack in the late 8th century BCE (2 Chronicles 32:2-4).&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, 2009. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

As compared with Samuel and Kings, the Book of Chronicles omits many particulars there recorded and includes many things not found in the other two documents. Often the Chronicles paint a somewhat more positive picture of the same events. This corresponds to their time of composition: Samuel and Kings were probably completed during the exile, at a time when the history of the newly wiped out Hebrew kingdoms was still fresh in the minds of the writers, a period largely considered{{By whom|date=April 2011}} a colossal failure. The Chronicles, on the other hand, were written much later, after the restoration of the Jewish community in [[Palestine]], at a time when the kingdoms were beginning to be regarded as the nostalgic past, something to be at least partially imitated, not something to be avoided. Scholars continue to debate over which history is more reliable: Chronicles or Samuel-Kings.

Twenty whole chapters of the Chronicles, and twenty-four parts of chapters, are occupied with matters not found elsewhere. It also records many people and events in fuller detail, as the list of David's heroes (1 Chr. 12:1–37), the removal of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] from Kirjath-jearim to [[Mount Zion]] (1 Chr. 13; 15:2–24; 16:4–43; comp. 2 Sam. 6), [[Uzziah]]'s ''[[tzaraas]]'' (commonly translated as &quot;[[leprosy]]&quot;) and its cause (2 Chr. 26:16–21; comp. 2 Kings 15:5), etc.  In addition, some of the Chronicler’s additions consist of speeches by key figures, such as David (1 Chr.  29:10–19), or other pronouncements, such as Hezekiah’s [[Passover]] letter (2 Chr. 30:6–9).

It has also been observed that another peculiarity of the book is that it substitutes more modern and more common expressions for those that had then become unusual or obsolete. This is seen particularly in the substitution of modern names of places, such as were in use in the writer's day, for the old names; thus [[Gezer]] (1 Chr. 20:4) is used instead of Gob (2 Sam. 21:18), etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=XAA64Jm8bGoC&amp;pg=PA134 ''The Bible Dictionary: Your Biblical Reference Book''], Matthew George Easton, 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Chronicles is alluded to, though not directly quoted, in the [[New Testament]] ([[Epistle to Hebrews|Hebrews]] 5:4; [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 12:42; 23:35; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:5; 11:31, 51).

In [[computer science]], a '''binary search tree''' ('''BST'''), which may sometimes also be called an '''ordered''' or '''sorted binary tree''', is a [[Node (computer science)|node-based]] [[binary tree]] [[data structure]]
which has the following properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

* The left [[Tree (data structure)#subtrees|subtree]] of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Generally, the information represented by each node is a record rather than a single data element.  However, for sequencing purposes, nodes are compared according to their keys rather than any part of their associated records.

The major advantage of binary search trees over other data structures is that the related [[sorting algorithm]]s and [[search algorithm]]s such as [[in-order traversal]] can be very efficient. 

Binary search trees are a fundamental [[data structure]] used to construct more abstract data structures such as [[set (computer science)|sets]], [[multiset]]s, and [[associative array]]s.

==Operations==
Operations on a binary search tree require comparisons between nodes. These comparisons are made with calls to a [[comparator (computer science)|comparator]], which is a [[subroutine]] that computes the total order (linear order) on any two values. This comparator can be explicitly or implicitly defined, depending on the language in which the BST is implemented.

===Searching===
Searching a binary search tree for a specific value can be a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] or [[Iteration#Computing|iterative]] process. This explanation covers a recursive method.

We begin by examining the [[Tree (data structure)#root nodes|root node]]. If the tree is null, the value we are searching for does not exist in the tree. Otherwise, if the value equals the root, the search is successful. If the value is less than the root, search the left subtree. Similarly, if it is greater than the root, search the right subtree. This process is repeated until the value is found or the indicated subtree is null. If the searched value is not found before a null subtree is reached, then the item must not be present in the tree.

Here is the search algorithm in the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# 'node' refers to the parent-node in this case
 def search_binary_tree(node, key):
     if node is None:
         return None  # key not found
     if key &lt; node.key:
         return search_binary_tree(node.leftChild, key)
     elif key &gt; node.key:
         return search_binary_tree(node.rightChild, key)
     else:  # key is equal to node key
         return node.value  # found key
&lt;/source&gt;
… or equivalent [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
 searchBinaryTree _   NullNode = Nothing
 searchBinaryTree key (Node nodeKey nodeValue (leftChild, rightChild)) =
     case compare key nodeKey of
       LT -&gt; searchBinaryTree key leftChild
       GT -&gt; searchBinaryTree key rightChild
       EQ -&gt; Just nodeValue
&lt;/source&gt;
This operation requires [[Big O notation|O]](log ''n'') time in the average case, but needs [[Big O notation|O]](''n'') time in the worst case, when the unbalanced tree resembles a [[linked list]] ([[Binary Tree#Types of binary trees|degenerate tree]]).

Assuming that BinarySearchTree is a class with a member function &quot;search(int)&quot; and a pointer to the root node, the algorithm is also easily implemented in terms of an iterative approach. The algorithm enters a loop, and decides whether to branch left or right depending on the value of the node at each parent node. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
bool BinarySearchTree::search(int val)
{
    Node *next = this-&gt;root();
    
    while (next != NULL) {
        if (val == next-&gt;value()) {
            return true;
        } else if (val &lt; next-&gt;value()) {
            next = next-&gt;left();   
        } else {
            next = next-&gt;right();
        }
    } 
            
    //not found
    return false;
}&lt;/source&gt;

===Insertion===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Red-black tree]] --&gt;
Insertion begins as a search would begin; if the root is not equal to the value, we search the left or right subtrees as before. Eventually, we will reach an external node and add the value as its right or left child, depending on the node's value. In other words, we examine the root and recursively insert the new node to the left subtree if the new value is less than the root, or the right subtree if the new value is greater than or equal to the root.

Here's how a typical binary search tree insertion might be performed in [[C++ (programming language)|C++]]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 /* Inserts the node pointed to by &quot;newNode&quot; into the subtree rooted at &quot;treeNode&quot; */
 void InsertNode(Node* &amp;treeNode, Node *newNode)
 {
     if (treeNode == NULL)
       treeNode = newNode;
     else if (newNode-&gt;key &lt; treeNode-&gt;key)
       InsertNode(treeNode-&gt;left, newNode);
     else
       InsertNode(treeNode-&gt;right, newNode);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The above &quot;destructive&quot; procedural variant modifies the tree in place. It uses only constant space, but the previous version of the tree is lost. Alternatively, as in the following [[Python (programming language)|Python]] example, we can reconstruct all ancestors of the inserted node; any reference to the original tree root remains valid, making the tree a [[persistent data structure]]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
 def binary_tree_insert(node, key, value):
     if node is None:
         return TreeNode(None, key, value, None)
      if key == node.key:
         return TreeNode(node.left, key, value, node.right)
     if key &lt; node.key:
         return TreeNode(binary_tree_insert(node.left, key, value), node.key, node.value, node.right)
     else:
         return TreeNode(node.left, node.key, node.value, binary_tree_insert(node.right, key, value))
&lt;/source&gt;

The part that is rebuilt uses Θ(log ''n'') space in the average case and Ω(''n'') in the worst case (see [[big-O notation]]).

In either version, this operation requires time proportional to the height of the tree in the worst case, which is [[Big O notation|O]](log ''n'') time in the average case over all trees, but Ω(''n'') time in the worst case.

Another way to explain insertion is that in order to insert a new node in the tree, its value is first compared with the value of the root. If its value is less than the root's, it is then compared with the value of the root's left child. If its value is greater, it is compared with the root's right child. This process continues, until the new node is compared with a leaf node, and then it is added as this node's right or left child, depending on its value.

There are other ways of inserting nodes into a binary tree, but this is the only way of inserting nodes at the leaves and at the same time preserving the BST structure.

Here is an iterative approach to inserting into a binary search tree the in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
private Node m_root;

public void insert(int data) {
    if (m_root == null) {
        m_root = new TreeNode(data, null, null);
        return;
    }
    Node root = m_root;
    while (root != null) {
        // Not the same value twice
        if (data == root.getData()) {
            return;
        } else if (data &lt; root.getData()) {
            // insert left
            if (root.getLeft() == null) {
                root.setLeft(new TreeNode(data, null, null));
                return;
            } else {
                root = root.getLeft();
            }
        } else {
            // insert right
            if (root.getRight() == null) {
                root.setRight(new TreeNode(data, null, null));
                return;
            } else {
                root = root.getRight();
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Below is a recursive approach to the insertion method. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
private Node m_root;

public void insert(int data){
    if (m_root == null) {
        m_root = TreeNode(data, null, null);	
    }else{
        internalInsert(m_root, data);
    }
}
	
private static void internalInsert(Node node, int data){
    // Not the same value twice
    if (data == node.getValue()) {
        return;
    } else if (data &lt; node.mValue) {
        if (node.getLeft() == null) {
            node.setLeft(new TreeNode(data, null, null));
        }else{
            internalInsert(node.getLeft(), data);
        }
    }else{
        if (node.getRight() == null) {
            node.setRight(new TreeNode(data, null, null));
        }else{
            internalInsert(node.getRight(), data);
        }	
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Deletion===&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Red-black tree]]--&gt;
There are three possible cases to consider:
* '''Deleting a leaf (node with no children):''' Deleting a leaf is easy, as we can simply remove it from the tree.
* '''Deleting a node with one child:''' Remove the node and replace it with its child.
* '''Deleting a node with two children:''' Call the node to be deleted ''N''.  Do not delete ''N''.  Instead, choose either its [[tree traversal|in-order]] successor node or its in-order predecessor node, ''R''.  Replace the value of ''N'' with the value of ''R'', then delete ''R''.

As with all binary trees, a node's in-order successor is the left-most child of its right subtree, and a node's in-order predecessor is the right-most child of its left subtree. In either case, this node will have zero or one children. Delete it according to one of the two simpler cases above.
[[Image:binary search tree delete.svg|frame|center|Deleting a node with two children from a binary search tree. The triangles represent subtrees of arbitrary size, each with its leftmost and rightmost child nodes at the bottom two vertices.]]

Consistently using the in-order successor or the in-order predecessor for every instance of the two-child case can lead to an [[Balanced tree|unbalanced]] tree, so good implementations add inconsistency to this selection.

Running Time Analysis:
Although this operation does not always traverse the tree down to a leaf, this is always a possibility; thus in the worst case it requires time proportional to the height of the tree. It does not require more even when the node has two children, since it still follows a single path and does not visit any node twice.

Here is the code in Python:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def findMin(self):
    '''
    Finds the smallest element that is a child of *self*
    '''
    current_node = self
    while current_node.left_child:
        current_node = current_node.left_child
    return current_node

def replace_node_in_parent(self, new_value=None):
    '''
    Removes the reference to *self* from *self.parent* and replaces it with *new_value*.
    '''
    if self.parent:
        if self == self.parent.left_child:
            self.parent.left_child = new_value
        else:
            self.parent.right_child = new_value
    if new_value:
        new_value.parent = self.parent

def binary_tree_delete(self, key):
    if key &lt; self.key:
        self.left_child.binary_tree_delete(key)
    elif key &gt; self.key:
        self.right_child.binary_tree_delete(key)
    else: # delete the key here
        if self.left_child and self.right_child: # if both children are present
            # get the smallest node that's bigger than *self*
            successor = self.right_child.findMin()
            self.key = successor.key
            # if *successor* has a child, replace it with that
            # at this point, it can only have a *right_child*
            # if it has no children, *right_child* will be &quot;None&quot;
            successor.replace_node_in_parent(successor.right_child)
        elif self.left_child or self.right_child:   # if the node has only one child
            if self.left_child:
                self.replace_node_in_parent(self.left_child)
            else:
                self.replace_node_in_parent(self.right_child)
        else: # this node has no children
            self.replace_node_in_parent(None)

&lt;/source&gt;

===Traversal===
{{main|Tree traversal}}
Once the binary search tree has been created, its elements can be retrieved [[in-order traversal|in-order]] by [[recursion|recursively]] traversing the left subtree of the root node, accessing the node itself, then recursively traversing the right subtree of the node, continuing this pattern with each node in the tree as it's recursively accessed. As with all binary trees, one may conduct a [[pre-order traversal]] or a [[post-order traversal]], but neither are likely to be useful for binary search trees.

The code for in-order traversal in Python is given below. It will call '''callback''' for every node in the tree.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def traverse_binary_tree(node, callback):
    if node is None:
        return
    traverse_binary_tree(node.leftChild, callback)
    callback(node.value)
    traverse_binary_tree(node.rightChild, callback)
&lt;/source&gt;

Traversal requires [[Big O notation#Related asymptotic notations|Ω(''n'')]] time, since it must visit every node. This algorithm is also O(''n''), so it is [[asymptotically optimal]].

===Sort===
A binary search tree can be used to implement a simple but efficient [[sorting algorithm]]. Similar to [[heapsort]], we insert all the values we wish to sort into a new ordered data structure&amp;mdash;in this case a binary search tree&amp;mdash;and then traverse it in order, building our result:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def build_binary_tree(values):
    tree = None
    for v in values:
        tree = binary_tree_insert(tree, v)
    return tree

def get_inorder_traversal(root):
    '''
    Returns a list containing all the values in the tree, starting at *root*.
    Traverses the tree in-order(leftChild, root, rightChild).
    '''
    result = []
    traverse_binary_tree(root, lambda element: result.append(element))
    return result
&lt;/source&gt;

The worst-case time of &lt;code&gt;build_binary_tree&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;mdash;if you feed it a sorted list of values, it chains them into a [[linked list]] with no left subtrees. For example, &lt;code&gt;traverse_binary_tree([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])&lt;/code&gt; yields the tree &lt;code&gt;(1 (2 (3 (4 (5)))))&lt;/code&gt;. 

There are several schemes for overcoming this flaw with simple binary trees; the most common is the [[self-balancing binary search tree]]. If this same procedure is done using such a tree, the overall worst-case time is [[Big O notation|O]](''n''log ''n''), which is [[asymptotically optimal]] for a [[comparison sort]]. In practice, the poor [[CPU cache|cache]] performance and added overhead in time and space for a tree-based sort (particularly for node [[dynamic memory allocation|allocation]]) make it inferior to other asymptotically optimal sorts such as  [[heapsort]] for static list sorting. On the other hand, it is one of the most efficient methods of ''incremental sorting'', adding items to a list over time while keeping the list sorted at all times.

==Types==
There are many types of binary search trees. [[AVL tree]]s and [[red-black tree]]s are both forms of [[self-balancing binary search tree]]s. A [[splay tree]] is a binary search tree that automatically moves frequently accessed elements nearer to the root. In a [[treap]] (&quot;tree [[heap (data structure)|heap]]&quot;), each node also holds a priority and the parent node has higher priority than its children.* [[Tango Trees]] are trees optimized for fast searches.

Two other titles describing binary search trees are that of a '''complete''' and '''degenerate''' tree.

A complete tree is a tree with n levels, where for each level d &lt;= n - 1, the number of existing nodes at level d is equal to 2&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;. This means all possible nodes exist at these levels. An additional requirement for a complete binary tree is that for the nth level, while every node does not have to exist, the nodes that do exist must fill from left to right.

A degenerate tree is a tree where for each parent node, there is only one associated child node. What this means is that in a performance measurement, the tree will essentially behave like a linked list data structure.

===Performance comparisons===
D. A. Heger (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=A Disquisition on The Performance Behavior of Binary Search Tree Data Structures | first1=Dominique A. | last1=Heger | year=2004 | journal=European Journal for the Informatics Professional | volume=5 | url=http://www.cepis.org/upgrade/files/full-2004-V.pdf | issue=5 | pages=67–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented a performance comparison of binary search trees. [[Treap]] was found to have the best average performance, while [[red-black tree]] was found to have the smallest amount of performance fluctuations.

===Optimal binary search trees===
If we don't plan on modifying a search tree, and we know exactly how often each item will be accessed, we can construct an '''optimal binary search tree''', which is a search tree where the average cost of looking up an item (the ''expected search cost'') is minimized.

Even if we only have estimates of the search costs, such a system can considerably speed up lookups on average. For example, if you have a BST of English words used in a [[spell checker]], you might balance the tree based on word frequency in [[text corpus|text corpora]], placing words like &quot;the&quot; near the root and words like &quot;agerasia&quot; near the leaves. Such a tree might be compared with [[Huffman tree]]s, which similarly seek to place frequently-used items near the root in order to produce a dense information encoding; however, Huffman trees only store data elements in leaves and these elements need not be ordered.

If we do not know the sequence in which the elements in the tree will be accessed in advance, we can use [[splay tree]]s which are asymptotically as good as any static search tree we can construct for any particular sequence of lookup operations.

'''Alphabetic trees''' are Huffman trees with the additional constraint on order, or, equivalently, search trees with the modification that all elements are stored in the leaves. Faster algorithms exist for '''optimal alphabetic binary trees''' (OABTs).

Example:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
procedure Optimum Search Tree(f, f´, c):
 for j = 0 to n do
  c[j, j] = 0, F[j, j] = f´j
  for d = 1 to n do
   for i = 0 to (n − d) do
    j = i + d
    F[i, j] = F[i, j − 1] + f´ + f´j
    c[i, j] = MIN(i&lt;k&lt;=j){c[i, k − 1] + c[k, j]} + F[i, j]
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[Image:binary tree.svg|right|192|thumb|A simple binary tree of size 9 and height 3, with a root node whose value is 2. The above tree is unbalanced and not sorted.]]
In [[computer science]], a '''binary tree''' is a [[tree (data structure)|tree data structure]] in which each node has at most two [[child node]]s, usually distinguished as &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;.  Nodes with children are [[parent node]]s, and child nodes may contain references to their parents.  Outside the tree, there is often a reference to the &quot;root&quot; node (the ancestor of all nodes), if it exists.  Any node in the data structure can be reached by starting at root node and repeatedly following references to either the left or right child.

Binary trees are  used to implement [[binary search tree]]s and [[binary heap]]s.

==Definitions for rooted trees==
* A '''directed edge''' refers to the link from the [[parent node|parent]] to the [[child node|child]] (the arrows in the picture of the tree).
* The [[root node]] of a tree is the [[node (computer science)|node]] with no parents.  There is at most one root node in a rooted tree.
* A [[leaf node]] has no children.
* The '''depth''' of a node n is the length of the path from the root to the node.  The set of all nodes at a given depth is sometimes called a '''level''' of the tree. The root node is at depth zero.
* The '''height''' of a tree is the length of the path from the root to the deepest node in the tree. A (rooted) tree with only one node (the root) has a height of zero.
* '''Siblings''' are nodes that share the same parent node.
* A node p is an '''ancestor''' of a node q if it exists on the path from q to the root. The node q is then termed a '''descendant''' of p.
* The '''size''' of a node is the number of descendants it has including itself.
*'''In-degree''' of a node is the number of edges arriving at that node.
* '''Out-degree''' of a node is the number of edges leaving that node.
* The root is the only node in the tree with In-degree = 0.
e.g.:depth of tree with level =3,then, size of tree is, level+1=4

==Types of binary trees==
* A '''rooted binary tree''' is a [[tree data structure|tree]] with a [[root node]] in which every node has at most two children.
* A '''full binary tree''' (sometimes '''proper binary tree''' or '''2-tree''' or '''strictly binary tree''') is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.
* A '''perfect binary tree''' is a ''full binary tree'' in which all ''leaves'' are at the same ''depth'' or same ''level''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/perfectBinaryTree.html|title=perfect binary tree | publisher = [[NIST]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is ambiguously also called a ''complete binary tree''.)
* A '''complete binary tree''' is a binary tree in which every level, ''except possibly the last'', is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/completeBinaryTree.html|title=complete binary tree| publisher = NIST}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--&quot;doubt please give correct perfect definition and example for full complete binary tree and also for height  and depth--&gt;
* An '''infinite complete binary tree''' is a tree with [[aleph number|&lt;math&gt;{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;]] levels, where for each level d the number of existing nodes at level d is equal to 2&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;. The cardinal number of the set of all nodes is &lt;math&gt;{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;. The cardinal number of the set of all paths is &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;. The infinite complete binary tree essentially describes the structure of the [[Cantor set]]; the unit interval on the real line (of cardinality &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;) is the continuous image of the Cantor set; this tree is sometimes called '''the''' [[Cantor space]].
* A '''balanced binary tree'''  is commonly defined as a binary tree in which the height of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.,&lt;ref&gt;Aaron M. Tenenbaum, et. al  Data Structures Using C, Prentice Hall, 1990  ISBN 0-13-199746-7&lt;/ref&gt; although in general it is a binary tree where no leaf is much farther away from the root than any other leaf.   (Different balancing schemes allow different definitions of &quot;much farther&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Black (ed.), entry for ''data structure'' in ''[[Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures]]. U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. 15 December 2004. [http://xw2k.nist.gov/dads//HTML/balancedtree.html Online version] Accessed 2010-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Binary trees that are balanced according to this definition have a predictable depth (how many nodes are traversed from the root to a leaf, root counting as node 0 and subsequent as 1, 2, ..., depth). This depth is equal to the integer part of &lt;math&gt;log_2(n)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of nodes on the balanced tree.  Example 1: balanced tree with 1 node, &lt;math&gt;log_2(1) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (depth = 0).  Example 2: balanced tree with 3 nodes, &lt;math&gt;log_2(3)=1.59&lt;/math&gt; (depth=1).  Example 3: balanced tree with 5 nodes, &lt;math&gt;log_2(5)=2.32&lt;/math&gt; (depth of tree is 2 nodes).
* A '''rooted complete binary tree''' can be identified with a [[free magma]].
* A '''degenerate tree''' is a tree where for each parent node, there is only one associated child node. This means that in a performance measurement, the tree will behave like a linked list data structure.
* A [[Tango tree]] is a tree optimized for fast searches.

Note that this terminology often varies in the literature, especially with respect to the meaning &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;full&quot;.
* A '''Strictly Binary Tree:-''' Its when the tree is fully expanded i.e., with 2 degree expansion.

==Properties of binary trees==
* The number of nodes ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;'' in a perfect binary tree can be found using this formula: ''&lt;math&gt;n = 2^{h+1}-1&lt;/math&gt;'' where ''&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;'' is the height of the tree.
* The number of nodes ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;'' in a complete binary tree is minimum: ''&lt;math&gt;n = 2^{h}&lt;/math&gt;'' and maximum: ''&lt;math&gt;n = 2^{h+1}-1&lt;/math&gt;'' where ''&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;'' is the height of the tree.
* The number of leaf nodes ''&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;'' in a perfect binary tree can be found using this formula: ''&lt;math&gt;L = 2^h&lt;/math&gt;'' where ''&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;'' is the height of the tree.
* The number of nodes ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;'' in a perfect binary tree can also be found using this formula: ''&lt;math&gt;n = 2L-1&lt;/math&gt;'' where ''&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;'' is the number of leaf nodes in the tree.
* The number of NULL links in a Complete Binary Tree of n-node is (n+1).
* The number of leaf nodes in a Complete Binary Tree of n-node is &lt;math&gt;\lceil n/2 \rceil&lt;/math&gt;.
* For any non-empty binary tree with ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; leaf nodes and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nodes of degree 2, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mehta | first=Dinesh | coauthors = Sartaj Sahni| title=Handbook of Data Structures and Applications|publisher=[[Chapman and Hall]]|isbn = 1584884355|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* n = n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + n&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + n&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + .... + n&lt;sub&gt;B-1&lt;/sub&gt; + n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;
* B = n - 1, n = 1 + 1*n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 2*n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3*n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 4*n&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + B*n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, NOT include n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

==Proof==
proof: n0=n2+1

    Let n = the total number of nodes
        B = the branches in T
        n0, n1, n2 represent the nodes with no children, single child, and two children respectively.

    B = n - 1
    B = n1 + 2*n2
    n = n1+ 2*n2 + 1
    n = n0 + n1 + n2
    n1+ 2*n2 + 1 = n0 + n1 + n2 ==&gt; n0 = n2 + 1

== Common Operations ==
There are a variety of different operations that can be performed on binary trees. Some are [[mutator method|mutator]] operations, while others simply return useful information about the tree.

=== Insertion ===
Nodes can be inserted into binary trees in between two other nodes or added after an [[external node]]. In binary trees, a node that is inserted is specified as to which child it is.

==== External nodes ====
Say that the external node being added on to is node A. To add a new node after node A, A assigns the new node as one of its children and the new node assigns node A as its parent.

==== Internal nodes ====
[[File:Insertion of binary tree node.JPG|thumb|360px|The process of inserting a node into a binary tree]] 
Insertion on [[internal node]]s is slightly more complex than on external nodes. Say that the internal node is node A and that node B is the child of A. (If the insertion is to insert a right child, then B is the right child of A, and similarly with a left child insertion.) A assigns its child to the new node and the new node assigns its parent to A. Then the new node assigns its child to B and B assigns its parent as the new node.

=== Deletion ===
Deletion is the process whereby a node is removed from the tree. Only certain nodes in a binary tree can be removed unambiguously.&lt;ref name=&quot;rice&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clear.rice.edu/comp212/03-spring/lectures/22/|title=Binary Tree Structure|author=Dung X. Nguyen|year=2003|work= |publisher=rice.edu|accessdate=December 28, 2010}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Node with zero or one children ====
[[File:Deletion of internal binary tree node.JPG|thumb|360px|The process of deleting an internal node in a binary tree]] 
Say that the node to delete is node A. If a node has no children ([[external node]]), deletion is accomplished by setting the child of A's parent to [[null pointer|null]] and A's parent to null. If it has one child, set the parent of A's child to A's parent and set the child of A's parent to A's child.

==== Node with two children ====
In a binary tree, a node with two children cannot be deleted unambiguously.&lt;ref name=&quot;rice&quot;/&gt; However, in certain binary trees these nodes ''can'' be deleted, including [[binary search tree]]s.

=== Iteration ===
Often, one wishes to visit each of the nodes in a tree and examine the value there, a process called [[iteration]] or [[enumeration]]. There are several common orders in which the nodes can be visited, and each has useful properties that are exploited in algorithms based on binary trees:

* Pre-Order:      Root first, Left child, Right child
* Post-Order:     Left Child, Right child, root
* In-Order:       Left child, root, right child.

==== Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal ====
{{Main|Tree traversal}}

Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal visit each node in a tree by recursively visiting each node in the left and right subtrees of the root. If the root node is visited before its subtrees, this is pre-order; if after, post-order; if between, in-order. In-order traversal is useful in [[binary search tree]]s, where this traversal visits the nodes in increasing order.

==== Depth-first order ====
In depth-first order, we always attempt to visit the node farthest from the root that we can, but with the caveat that it must be a child of a node we have already visited. Unlike a depth-first search on graphs, there is no need to remember all the nodes we have visited, because a tree cannot contain cycles. Pre-order is a special case of this. See [[depth-first search]] for more information.

==== Breadth-first order ====
Contrasting with depth-first order is breadth-first order, which always attempts to visit the node closest to the root that it has not already visited. See [[breadth-first search]] for more information. Also called a ''level-order traversal''.

==Type theory==

In [[type theory]], a binary tree with nodes of type A is defined [[inductive datatype|inductively]] as ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = μα. 1 + ''A'' &amp;times; α &amp;times; α.

==Definition in graph theory==

For each binary tree data structure, there is equivalent rooted [[binary tree (graph theory)|binary tree]] in graph theory.

[[graph theory|Graph theorists]] use the following definition: A binary tree is a [[connected graph|connected]] [[Forest (graph theory)|acyclic graph]] such that the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of each [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] is no more than three. It can be shown that in any binary tree of two or more nodes, there are exactly two more nodes of degree one than there are of degree three, but there can be any number of nodes of degree two. A '''rooted binary tree''' is such a graph that has one of its vertices of degree no more than two singled out as the root.

With the root thus chosen, each vertex will have a uniquely defined parent, and up to two children; however, so far there is insufficient information to distinguish a left or right child. If we drop the connectedness requirement, allowing multiple [[connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] in the graph, we call such a structure a forest.

Another way of defining binary trees is a recursive definition on directed graphs. A binary tree is either:
* A single vertex.
* A graph formed by taking two binary trees, adding a vertex, and adding an edge directed from the new vertex to the root of each binary tree.
This also does not establish the order of children, but does fix a specific root node.

==Combinatorics==

In combinatorics one considers the problem of counting the number of binary trees of a given size.  Here the trees have no values attached to their nodes (this would just multiply the number of possible trees by an easily determined factor), and trees are distinguished only by their structure; however the left and right child of any node are distinguished (if they are different trees, then interchanging them will produce a tree distinct from the original one). The size of the tree is taken to be the number ''n'' of internal nodes (those with two children); the other nodes are leaf nodes and there are {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} of them. The number of such binary trees of size ''n'' is equal to the number of ways of fully parenthesizing a string of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} symbols (representing leaves) separated by ''n'' binary operators (representing internal nodes), so as to determine the argument subexpressions of each operator. For instance for {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 3}} one has to parenthesize a string like {{nowrap| &lt;math&gt;X*X*X*X&lt;/math&gt;}}, which is possible in five ways:
: &lt;math&gt;((X*X)*X)*X,\qquad (X*(X*X))*X,\qquad (X*X)*(X*X),\qquad X*((X*X)*X),\qquad X*(X*(X*X)).&lt;/math&gt;
The correspondence to binary trees should be obvious, and the addition of redundant parentheses (around an already parenthesized expression or around the full expression) is disallowed (or at least not counted as producing a new possibility).

There is a unique binary tree of size 0 (consisting of a single leaf), and any other binary tree is characterized by the pair of its left and right children; if these have sizes ''i'' and ''j'' respectively, the full tree has size {{nowrap|''i'' + ''j'' + 1}}. Therefore the number &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; of binary trees of size ''n'' has the following recursive description &lt;math&gt;C_0=1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle C_n=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}C_iC_{n-1-i}&lt;/math&gt; for any positive integer ''n''. It follows that &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Catalan number]] of index ''n''.

The above parenthesized strings should not be confused with the set of words of length 2''n'' in the [[Dyck language]], which consist only of parentheses in such a way that they are properly balanced. The number of such strings satisfies the same recursive description (each Dyck word of length 2''n'' is determined by the Dyck subword enclosed by the initial '(' and its matching ')' together with the Dyck subword remaining after that closing parenthesis, whose lengths 2''i'' and 2''j'' satisfy {{nowrap|''i'' + ''j'' + 1 {{=}} ''n''}}); this number is therefore also the Catalan number &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt;. So there are also five Dyck words of length 10:
: &lt;math&gt;()()(),\qquad ()(()),\qquad (())(),\qquad (()()),\qquad ((()))&lt;/math&gt;.
These Dyck words do not correspond in an obvious way to binary trees. A bijective correspondence can nevertheless be defined as follows: enclose the Dyck word in a extra pair of parentheses, so that the result can be interpreted as a [[Lisp]] list expression (with the empty list () as only occurring atom); then the [[Lisp (programming language)#S-expressions represent lists|dotted-pair]] expression for that proper list is a fully parenthesized expression (with NIL as symbol and '.' as operator) describing the corresponding binary tree (which is in fact the internal representation of the proper list).

The ability to represent binary trees as strings of symbols and parentheses implies that binary trees can represent the elements of a [[free magma]] on a singleton set.

== Methods for storing binary trees ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ahnentafel]] --&gt;
Binary trees can be constructed from [[programming language]] primitives in several ways.

=== Nodes and references ===

In a language with [[record (computer science)|records]] and [[reference (computer science)|reference]]s, binary trees are typically constructed by having a tree node structure which contains some data and references to its left child and its right child. Sometimes it also contains a reference to its unique parent. If a node has fewer than two children, some of the child pointers may be set to a special null value, or to a special [[sentinel node]].

In languages with [[tagged union]]s such as [[ML (programming language)|ML]], a tree node is often a tagged union of two types of nodes, one of which is a 3-tuple of data, left child, and right child, and the other of which is a &quot;leaf&quot; node, which contains no data and functions much like the null value in a language with pointers.

===  Arrays ===

Binary trees can also be stored as an [[implicit data structure]] in [[array data structure|array]]s, and if the tree is a complete binary tree, this method wastes no space. In this compact arrangement, if a node has an index ''i'', its children are found at indices &lt;math&gt;2i + 1&lt;/math&gt;(for the left child) and &lt;math&gt;2i +2&lt;/math&gt;(for the right), while its parent (if any) is found at index ''&lt;math&gt;\left \lfloor \frac{i-1}{2} \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;'' (assuming the root has index zero). This method benefits from more compact storage and better [[locality of reference]], particularly during a preorder traversal. However, it is expensive to grow and wastes space proportional to 2&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt; - ''n'' for a tree of height ''h'' with ''n'' nodes.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Binary tree in array.svg|300px|A small complete binary tree stored in an array]]&lt;/center&gt;

== Encodings ==
=== Succinct encodings ===
A [[succinct data structure]] is one which takes the absolute minimum possible space, as established by [[information theory|information theoretical]] lower bounds. The number of different binary trees on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C}_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th [[Catalan number]] (assuming we view trees with identical ''structure'' as identical). For large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, this is about &lt;math&gt;4^{n}&lt;/math&gt;; thus we need at least about &lt;math&gt;\log_{2}4^{n} = 2n&lt;/math&gt; bits to encode it. A succinct binary tree therefore would occupy only 2 bits per node.

One simple representation which meets this bound is to visit the nodes of the tree in preorder, outputting &quot;1&quot; for an internal node and &quot;0&quot; for a leaf. [http://theory.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.897/spring03/scribe_notes/L12/lecture12.pdf] If the tree contains data, we can simply simultaneously store it in a consecutive array in preorder. This function accomplishes this:

 '''function''' EncodeSuccinct(''node'' n, ''bitstring'' structure, ''array'' data) {
     '''if''' n = ''nil'' '''then'''
         append 0 to structure;
     '''else'''
         append 1 to structure;
         append n.data to data;
         EncodeSuccinct(n.left, structure, data);
         EncodeSuccinct(n.right, structure, data);
 }

The string ''structure'' has only &lt;math&gt;2n + 1&lt;/math&gt; bits in the end, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of (internal) nodes; we don't even have to store its length. To show that no information is lost, we can convert the output back to the original tree like this:

 '''function''' DecodeSuccinct(''bitstring'' structure, ''array'' data) {
     remove first bit of ''structure'' and put it in ''b''
     '''if''' b = 1 '''then'''
         create a new node ''n''
         remove first element of data and put it in n.data
         n.left = DecodeSuccinct(structure, data)
         n.right = DecodeSuccinct(structure, data)
         '''return''' n
     '''else'''
         '''return''' nil
 }

More sophisticated succinct representations allow not only compact storage of trees but even useful operations on those trees directly while they're still in their succinct form.

=== Encoding general trees as binary trees ===
There is a one-to-one mapping between general ordered trees and binary trees, which in particular is used by [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] to represent general ordered trees as binary trees. To convert a general ordered tree to binary tree, we only need to represent the general tree in left child-sibling way. The result of this representation will be automatically binary tree, if viewed from a different perspective. Each node ''N'' in the ordered tree corresponds to a node ''N' '' in the binary tree; the ''left'' child of ''N' '' is the node corresponding to the first child of ''N'', and the ''right'' child of ''N' '' is the node corresponding to ''N'' 's next sibling --- that is, the next node in order among the children of the parent of ''N''. This binary tree representation of a general order tree is sometimes also referred to as a [[left child-right sibling binary tree]] (LCRS tree), or a [[doubly chained tree]], or a [[Filial-Heir chain]].

One way of thinking about this is that each node's children are in a [[linked list]], chained together with their ''right'' fields, and the node only has a pointer to the beginning or head of this list, through its ''left'' field.

For example, in the tree on the left, A has the 6 children {B,C,D,E,F,G}.  It can be converted into the binary tree on the right.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:N-ary to binary.svg|400x240px|An example of converting an n-ary tree to a binary tree]]
&lt;/center&gt;

The binary tree can be thought of as the original tree tilted sideways, with the black left edges representing ''first child'' and the blue right edges representing ''next sibling''.  The leaves of the tree on the left would be written in Lisp as:

:(((N O) I J) C D ((P) (Q)) F (M))

which would be implemented in memory as the binary tree on the right, without any letters on those nodes that have a left child.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General definition==
In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]], a Borel measure is defined as follows: let ''X'' be a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]], and let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}(X)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Sigma-algebra#Generated_.CF.83-algebra|smallest &amp;sigma;-algebra]] that contains the open sets of ''X''; this is known as the σ-algebra of Borel sets. Any measure μ defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets is called a '''Borel measure'''. Some authors require in addition that μ(C)&lt;∞ for every compact set C. If a Borel measure μ is both [[inner regular]] and [[outer regular]], it is called a '''regular Borel measure'''. If μ is both inner regular and [[Locally finite measure|locally finite]], it is called a [[Radon measure]]. Note that a locally finite Borel measure automatically satisfies  μ(C)&lt;∞ for every compact set C.

==On the real line==
The real line '''R''' with its [[Real line|usual topology]] is a locally compact Hausdorff space, hence we can define a Borel measure on it. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}(\textbf{R})&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open intervals of '''R'''. While there are many Borel measures μ, the choice of Borel measure which assigns &lt;math&gt;\mu([a,b])=b-a&lt;/math&gt; for every interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes called &quot;the&quot; Borel measure on '''R'''. In practice, even &quot;the&quot; Borel measure is not the most useful measure defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets; indeed, the [[Lebesgue measure]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an extension of &quot;the&quot; Borel measure which possesses the crucial property that it is a [[complete measure]] (unlike the Borel measure). To clarify, when one says that the Lebesgue measure &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an extension of the Borel measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, it means that every Borel measureable set ''E'' is also a  Lebesgue measureable set, and the Borel measure and the Lebesgue measure coincide on the Borel sets (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\lambda(E)=\mu(E)&lt;/math&gt; for every Borel measureable set).

'''''Blackadder''''' is the name that encompassed four series of a [[BBC1]] historical [[British sitcom|sitcom]], along with several [[List of Blackadder episodes#Additional appearances|one-off instalments]]. All episodes starred [[Rowan Atkinson]] as anti-hero [[Edmund Blackadder]] and [[Tony Robinson]] as Blackadder's [[dogsbody]], [[Baldrick]]. Each series was set in a different historical period with the two [[protagonist]]s accompanied by different characters, though several reappear in one series or another, for example [[Melchett]] and [[Lord Flashheart]]. 

The [[The Black Adder|first series]] was written by [[Richard Curtis (screenwriter)|Richard Curtis]] and Rowan Atkinson, while subsequent episodes were written by Curtis and [[Ben Elton]]. The shows were produced by [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]]. In 2000 the fourth series, ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'', ranked at 16 in the &quot;[[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]]&quot;, a list created by the [[British Film Institute]]. Also in the 2004 TV poll to find &quot;[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]&quot;, ''Blackadder'' was voted the second-best British sitcom of all time, topped by ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''. It was also ranked as the 20th-best TV show of all time by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;empire&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/50greatesttv/default.asp?tv=20 |title=The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time – Number 20: Blackadder |work=Empire  |accessdate=5 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
Although each series is set in a different era, all follow the fortunes (or rather, misfortunes) of [[Edmund Blackadder]] (played by Atkinson), who in each is a member of a British family [[dynasty]] present at many significant periods and places in British history. It is implied in each series that the Blackadder character is a descendant of the previous one, although it is never mentioned how any of the Blackadders manage to father children.&lt;ref name=bcg&gt;{{British Comedy Guide|sitcom|blackadder}}, URL accessed 25 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the character is quite unintelligent in the first series, he is increasingly clever and perceptive in subsequent generations (while decreasing in social status). Each Blackadder though is a [[cynicism|cynical]], [[cowardice|cowardly]] [[opportunism|opportunist]] concerned with maintaining and increasing his own status and fortunes, regardless of his surroundings.

The lives of each of the Blackadders are also entwined with their servants, all from the [[Baldrick]] family line (played by [[Tony Robinson]]). Each generation acts as the [[dogsbody]] to his respective Blackadder. They decrease in intelligence (and in personal hygiene standards) just as their masters' intellect increases. Each Blackadder and Baldrick are also saddled with the company of a dim-witted [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] whose presence Blackadder must somehow tolerate. This role was taken in the first two series by [[Lord Percy Percy]] ([[Tim McInnerny]]), in the third series by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince George, Prince Regent]], and in the fourth by [[George (Blackadder character)|Lieutenant George]], the latter two played by [[Hugh Laurie]].

Each series was set in a different period of [[History of the British Isles|British history]], beginning in 1485 and ending in 1917 comprising six half-hour episodes. The first series, made in 1983, was called ''[[The Black Adder]]'' (set in the fictional reign of '[[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard IV]]'). This was followed by a second series, ''[[Blackadder II]]'' (1986) set during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]), a third series ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (1987) set during the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and finally ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' (1989) in 1917, set in the trenches of the [[World War I|Great War]].

==Series and specials==
{{See also|List of Blackadder episodes}}

===Series 1: ''The Black Adder''===
{{Main|The Black Adder}}
''[[The Black Adder]]'' was the first series of ''Blackadder'' and was written by [[Richard Curtis]] and [[Rowan Atkinson]], and produced by [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]]. The series was originally aired on [[BBC1]] from 15 June 1983 to 20 July 1983, and was a joint production with the Australian [[Seven Network]].

Set in 1485 at the end of the [[Britain in the Middle Ages|British Middle Ages]], the series is written as a [[secret history]] which contends that [[Richard III of England|King Richard III]] won the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], only to be accidentally murdered, and is succeeded by [[Richard IV]], one of the [[Princes in the Tower]]. The series follows the exploits of Richard IV's unfavoured second son [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Edmund, the Duke of Edinburgh]] (who calls himself &quot;The Black Adder&quot;) in his various attempts to increase his standing with his father (although in one episode it is revealed he is illegitimate) and his eventual quest to overthrow him.

Conceived while Atkinson and Curtis were working on ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'', the series dealt comically with a number of medieval issues in Britain – [[witchcraft]], Royal succession, European relations, the [[Crusade]]s and the conflict between the Church and the Crown. Along with the secret history, many historical events portrayed in the series were anachronistic (for example, the [[ninth crusade|last Crusade to the Holy Land]] ended in 1291); this poetic licence would continue in the subsequent ''Blackadders''. The filming of the series was highly ambitious, with a large cast and much location shooting. The series also featured [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] dialogue, often adapted for comic effect. The end credits featured the words &quot;Additional Dialogue by William Shakespeare&quot;.

===Series 2: ''Blackadder II''===
{{Main|Blackadder II}}
''Blackadder II'' is set in [[Kingdom of England|England]] during the reign of [[Queenie|Queen Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603), played by [[Miranda Richardson]]. The principal character is [[Lord Blackadder|Edmund, Lord Blackadder]], the great-grandson of the original Black Adder. During the series, he often comes into contact with the [[British monarchy|Queen]], her obsequious [[Lord Chamberlain]] [[Melchett|Lord Melchett]] ([[Stephen Fry]]) with whom he has a rivalry, and The Queen's demented former nanny [[Nursie]] ([[Patsy Byrne]]).

Following the BBC's request for improvements (and a severe budget reduction), several changes were made. The second series was the first to establish the familiar Blackadder character: cunning, shrewd and witty, in sharp contrast to the bumbling [[Prince Edmund (Blackadder)|Prince Edmund]] of the first series. To make the show more cost-effective, it was also shot with virtually no outdoor scenes (in contrast to the first series which was shot largely on location) and several, frequently used, indoor sets, such as the Queen's [[throne room]] and Blackadder's front room.

A quote from this series was placed in third position for the top twenty-five television 'put downs' of the last 40 years by the [[Radio Times]] magazine. It was the following insult directed at Lord Percy by Edmund Blackadder:
&quot;The eyes are open, the mouth moves, but Mr Brain has long since departed, hasn't he, Percy?&quot;

===Series 3: ''Blackadder the Third''===
{{Main|Blackadder the Third}}

''Blackadder the Third'' is set in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a period known as the [[English Regency|Regency]]. In the series, [[Mr. E. Blackadder|E. Blackadder]] Esquire is the butler to the [[George (Blackadder character)|Prince of Wales]] (the prince is played by [[Hugh Laurie]] as a complete [[fop]] and idiot). Despite Edmund's respected intelligence and abilities, he has no personal fortune to speak of, apart from his frequently fluctuating wage packet from the Prince, as he says: 'If I'm running short of cash all I have to do is go upstairs and ask Prince Fat-head for a raise'.

As well as Rowan Atkinson and Tony Robinson in their usual roles, this series starred [[Hugh Laurie]] as the [[Prince Regent]], and [[Helen Atkinson-Wood]] as [[Mrs. Miggins]]. The series features [[rotten borough]]s (or &quot;rubber buttons&quot;), [[Samuel Johnson|Dr. Samuel Johnson]] (played by [[Robbie Coltrane]]), [[William Pitt the Younger]] (Simon Osborne), the [[French Revolution]] (featuring [[Chris Barrie]], [[Nigel Planer]] and [[Tim McInnerny]] as [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]]), over-the-top [[English Renaissance theatre|theatrical actors]], a squirrel-hating [[transvestite]] [[highwayman]], and a [[duel]] with the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] (played by [[Stephen Fry]]).

===Series 4: ''Blackadder Goes Forth''===
{{Main|Blackadder Goes Forth}}
This series is set in 1917, on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in the trenches of the First World War. Another &quot;big push&quot; is planned, and [[Captain Blackadder]]'s one goal is to avoid being killed, so he plots ways to get out of it. Blackadder is joined by his [[batman (military)|batman]] [[Baldrick#Blackadder Goes Forth|Private S. Baldrick]] (Tony Robinson) and idealistic [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] twit [[George (Blackadder character)#Blackadder Goes Forth|Lieutenant George]] ([[Hugh Laurie]]). [[Melchett#Blackadder Goes Forth (General Sir Anthony Cecil Hogmanay Melchett)|General Melchett]]  (Stephen Fry) rallies his troops from a French [[château]] thirty-five miles from the front, where he is aided and abetted by his assistant, [[Kevin Darling|Captain Darling]] (Tim McInnerny), pencil-pusher supreme and Blackadder's nemesis, whose name is played on for maximum comedy value.

The series is somewhat darker in tone than the other ''Blackadders''; it details the depredations of trench warfare as well as the infamous incompetence and life-wasting strategies of the top brass. For example, Baldrick is reduced to making coffee from mud and cooking rats, while General Melchett hatches a plan for the troops to walk very slowly toward the German lines, because &quot;it'll be the last thing Fritz will expect.&quot;

The final episode of this series, &quot;[[Goodbyeee]]&quot;, is known for being extraordinarily poignant for a comedy – especially the final scene, which sees the main characters (Blackadder, Baldrick, George, and Darling) finally venturing forward and charging off to die in the fog and smoke of [[no man's land]]. In a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] drawn up by the [[British Film Institute]] in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, ''Blackadder Goes Forth'' was placed 16th.

===Specials===
====Pilot episode====
{{Main|The Black Adder (pilot episode)}}
The ''Blackadder'' pilot was shot but never aired on terrestrial TV in the UK (although some scenes were shown in the 25th anniversary special ''Blackadder Rides Again''). One notable difference in the pilot, as in many pilots, is the casting. Baldrick is played not by Tony Robinson, but by [[Philip Fox (actor)|Philip Fox]]. Another significant difference is that the character of Prince Edmund presented in the pilot is much closer to the intelligent, conniving Blackadder of the later series than the snivelling, weak Edmund of the original series. Set in the year 1582, the script of the pilot is roughly the same as the episode &quot;[[Born to be King]]&quot;, albeit with some different jokes, with some lines appearing in other episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackadderhall.com/specials/5.html &quot;The Pilot Episode&quot;], [http://www.blackadderhall.com/ BlackadderHall.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blackadder: The Cavalier Years====
{{Main|Blackadder: The Cavalier Years}}
This special, set in the [[English Civil War]], was shown as part of [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]'s [[Comic Relief (charity)|Red Nose Day]] on Friday 5 February 1988. The 15-minute episode is set in November 1648, during the last days of the Civil War. Sir Edmund Blackadder and his servant, Baldrick, are the last two men loyal to the defeated King [[Charles I of England]] (played by Stephen Fry, portrayed as a soft-spoken, ineffective, slightly dim character, with the voice and mannerisms of Charles I's namesake, the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|current Prince of Wales]]). However, due to a misunderstanding between [[Oliver Cromwell]] (guest-star [[Warren Clarke]]) and Baldrick, the king is arrested and sent to the [[Tower of London]]. The rest of the episode revolves around Blackadder's attempts to save the king, as well as improve his standing.

====Blackadder's Christmas Carol====
{{Main|Blackadder's Christmas Carol}}
The second special was broadcast on Friday 23 December 1988. In a twist on [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', [[Ebenezer Blackadder]] is the &quot;kindest and loveliest&quot; man in England. The Spirit of Christmas shows Blackadder the contrary antics of his ancestors and descendants, and reluctantly informs him that if he turns evil his descendants will enjoy power and fortune, while if he remains the same a future Blackadder will live shamefully subjugated to a future incompetent Baldrick. This remarkable encounter causes him to proclaim, &quot;Bad guys have all the fun&quot;, and adopt the personality with which viewers are more familiar.

====Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth====
{{Main|Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth}}
''Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth'' was originally shown in the [[Millennium Dome]] in 2000, followed by a screening on [[Sky1|Sky One]] in the same year (and later on BBC1). It is set on the turn of the [[millennium]], and features Lord Blackadder placing a bet with his friends – modern versions of Queenie (Miranda Richardson), Melchett (Stephen Fry), George (Hugh Laurie) and Darling (Tim McInnerny) – that he has built a working [[Time travel in fiction|time machine]]. While this is intended as a clever [[confidence trick|con trick]], the machine, surprisingly, works, sending Blackadder and Baldrick back to the time of the [[dinosaur]]s, where they manage to cause the extinction of the dinosaurs, through the use of Baldrick's best, worst and only pair of underpants as a weapon against a hungry [[T. Rex]]. Finding that Baldrick has forgotten to write dates on the machine's dials, the rest of the film follows their attempts to find their way back to 1999, often creating huge historical anomalies in the process which must be corrected before the end. The film includes [[cameo appearance]]s from [[Kate Moss]] and [[Colin Firth]].

==Production==
===Series development===
Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis developed the idea for the sitcom while working on ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]''. Eager to avoid comparisons to the critically acclaimed ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', they proposed the idea of a historical sitcom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interviews&quot;&gt;''I Have a Cunning Plan – 20th Anniversary of Blackadder'', [[BBC Radio 4]] documentary broadcast 23 August 2003. Excerpts available at [http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackadder/interviews/ bbc.co.uk], URL accessed 17 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Curtis interview&quot;&gt;[http://www.blackadderhall.com/library/richard_interview.html Interview] at Blackadder Hall, URL accessed 17 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An [[The Black Adder (unaired pilot)|unaired pilot episode]] was made in 1982, and a six episode series was commissioned. The budget for the series was considerable, with much location shooting particularly at [[Alnwick Castle]] in Northumberland and the surrounding countryside in February 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alnwickcastle.com/television.php Alnwick Castle official website], URL accessed 2 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084988/locations Locations] at the [[Internet Movie Database]], URL accessed 17 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The series also used large casts of extras, horses and expensive medieval-style costumes. Atkinson has said about the making of the first series:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first series was odd, it was very extravagant. It cost a million pounds for the six programmes... [which] was a lot of money to spend...It looked great, but it wasn't as consistently funny as we would have liked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interviews&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Due to the high cost of the first series, the then controller of programming of [[BBC1]], [[Michael Grade]] was reluctant to sign off a second series without major improvements and cost cutting to be made to the show, leaving a gap of three years between the two series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewisohn&quot;&gt;Lewisohn, Mark, [http://web.archive.org/web/20050408071319/www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/b/blackadderthe_7770760.shtml ''The Black Adder] at the former [[BBC Guide to Comedy]], URL accessed 17 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Atkinson did not wish to continue writing for the second series, so writer and [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] [[Ben Elton]] was chosen to replace him.

''Blackadder II'' was therefore to be a studio-only production (along with the inclusion of a live audience during recording, instead of showing the episodes to one after taping). Besides adding more jokes, Elton suggested a major change in character emphasis: Baldrick would become the stupid [[sidekick]], while Edmund Blackadder evolved into a cunning [[sycophant]]. This led to the familiar set-up that was maintained in the following series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britain's Best Sitcom&quot;&gt;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sitcom/advocate_blackadder.shtml Britain's Best Sitcom – Blackadder]'', 2004 BBC Television documentary, presented by [[John Sergeant (journalist)|John Sergeant]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in the ''Back &amp; Forth'' millennium special was the shooting once again on location, because this was a production with a budget estimated at £3&amp;nbsp;million, and was a joint venture between [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect]], [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television]], the New Millennium Experience Company and the BBC, rather than the BBC alone.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/419247.stm Blackadder's millennium duel]'', [[BBC News]], Friday, 13 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.blackadderhall.com/library/skyview.html Black to the Future – Interview with Tony Robinson]' in ''Skyview'', January 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212579/trivia Trivia] at the Internet Movie Database, URL accessed 20 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
{{Main|List of characters in Blackadder}}
Each series tended to feature the same set of regular actors in different period settings, although throughout the four series and specials, only Blackadder and Baldrick were constant characters. Several regular cast members recurred as characters with similar names, implying, like Blackadder, that they were descendants.

====Main cast====
*[[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Edmund Blackadder]], the series' protagonist.
*[[Tony Robinson]] as [[Baldrick|S. Baldrick]], his servant.
*[[Stephen Fry]] played [[Melchett]] in two series, first as Lord Melchett, the sycophantic adviser to [[Queenie|Queen Elizabeth I]] in series two and secondly as General Melchett, a blustering buffoon and presumed descendant in series four. Fry also appeared as [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], The Duke Of Wellington in series three and as various characters in ''Blackadder Back &amp; Forth''.
*[[Tim McInnerny]] played [[Lord Percy Percy]], Blackadder's dimwitted sidekick in series one and two before a change of character to antagonist Captain [[Kevin Darling]] in series four. He also appeared as [[The Scarlet Pimpernel]] (alias Lord Topper and [[Le Comte de Frou Frou]]) for one episode in the third series, and reprised his role as Darling in ''Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth''.
*[[Hugh Laurie]] played [[George (Blackadder character)|George]] in series three and four, first as HRH [[George IV of the United Kingdom|The Prince Regent]], and later Lieutenant George in series four. Laurie also appeared twice in series two as Simon &quot;Farters Parters&quot; Partridge and Prince Ludwig the Indestructible in the final instalment of ''Blackadder II''. He similarly reprised this role in ''Back &amp; Forth''.
*[[Miranda Richardson]] was only a regular cast member for series two where she played [[Queenie#Blackadder II|Queen Elizabeth I]], reprising the role in ''Blackadder's Christmas Carol'' and ''Back &amp; Forth''. However, she also played significant one-off roles as [[Amy Hardwood]] (aka The Shadow) in &quot;[[Amy and Amiability (Blackadder)|Amy and Amiability]]&quot; in the third series and Mary Fletcher-Brown, a dutiful nurse in &quot;[[General Hospital (Blackadder)|General Hospital]]&quot; from the fourth.

====Non-recurring cast====
*[[Brian Blessed]], [[Elspet Gray]] and [[Robert East (actor)|Robert East]] appeared in all six episodes of the first series as the Black Adder's father, mother and brother respectively. Gray had also appeared in the non-broadcast pilot.
*[[Patsy Byrne]] played Nursie in all six episodes of ''[[Blackadder II]]'' but never featured in either of the subsequent series, either as a regular character or one-off. She briefly reprised the character in ''[[Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth]]'' and ''[[Blackadder's Christmas Carol]]''.
*[[Helen Atkinson-Wood]] played the role of [[Mrs. Miggins]] in all six episodes of ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'', but did not appear again in the programme, although the character was mentioned several times in ''Blackadder II'' and in the final episode of ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]''.

====Guest cast====
[[Ben Elton]]'s arrival after the first series heralded the more frequent recruitment of comic actors from the famed &quot;[[alternative comedy|alternative]]&quot; era for guest appearances, including [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Rik Mayall]] (who had appeared in the final episode of the first series as &quot;Mad Gerald&quot;), [[Adrian Edmondson]], [[Nigel Planer]], [[Mark Arden]], [[Stephen Frost]], [[Chris Barrie]] and [[Jeremy Hardy]]. Elton himself played an anarchist in ''Blackadder the Third''.

[[Gabrielle Glaister]] played [[Bob (Blackadder character)|Bob]] – an attractive girl who poses as a man appears in both series 2 and 4. [[Rik Mayall]] plays [[Lord Flashheart]], a vulgar yet successful rival of Blackadder in two episodes of series 2 and 4. Mayall had appeared in ''The Black Adder'' as Mad Gerald. He also played a decidedly Flashheart-like [[Robin Hood]] in ''Back &amp; Forth''. [[Lee Cornes]] also appeared in an episode of all three Curtis-Elton series. He appeared as a guard in the episode &quot;Chains&quot; of ''Blackadder II''; as the poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] in the episode &quot;Ink and Incapability' of ''Blackadder the Third''; and as firing squad soldier [[Private (rank)|Private]] Fraser in the episode &quot;Corporal Punishment&quot; of ''Blackadder Goes Forth''.

More 'establishment'-style actors, some at the veteran stage of their careers, were also recruited for roles. These included [[Brian Blessed]], [[Peter Cook]], [[John Grillo]], [[Simon Jones]], [[Tom Baker]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Hugh Paddick]], [[Frank Finlay]], [[Miriam Margolyes]], [[Kenneth Connor]], [[Bill Wallis]], [[Ronald Lacey]], Roger Blake, [[Denis Lill]], [[Warren Clarke]] and [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]], who played [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig]] in &quot;[[Goodbyeee]]&quot;, the final, fatal episode of ''Blackadder Goes Forth''.

Unusually for a sitcom based loosely on factual events and in the historical past, a man was recruited for one episode essentially to play himself. Political commentator [[Vincent Hanna]] played a character billed as &quot;his own great-great-great grandfather&quot; in the episode &quot;[[Dish and Dishonesty (Blackadder)|Dish and Dishonesty]]&quot; of ''Blackadder the Third''. Hanna was asked to take part because the scene was of a by-election in which Baldrick was a candidate and, in the style of modern television, Hanna gave a long-running &quot;live&quot; commentary of events at the count (and interviewed candidates and election agents) to a crowd through the [[town hall]] window.

===Theme tune===
[[Howard Goodall]]'s [[theme music|theme tune]] has the same [[melody]] throughout all the series, but is played in roughly the [[History of music|style of the period]] in which it is set. It is performed mostly with trumpets and [[timpani]] in ''The Black Adder'', the fanfares used suggesting typical medieval court fanfares; with a combination of [[recorder]], [[string quartet]] and electric guitar in ''Blackadder II''; on [[oboe]], cello and [[harpsichord]] (in the style of a [[minuet]]) for ''Blackadder the Third''; by a [[military band]] in ''Blackadder Goes Forth''; sung by [[Carol (music)|carol singers]] in ''Blackadder's Christmas Carol''; and by an orchestra in ''Blackadder: The Cavalier Years'' and ''Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howardgoodall.co.uk/tvthemes/tv.htm#adderpersonnel &quot;List of Musicians and Singers who Played or Sang on Blackadder and Red Dwarf Themes&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2000 the fourth series, ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'', ranked at 16 in the &quot;[[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]]&quot;, a list created by the [[British Film Institute]]. Also in the 2004 TV poll to find &quot;[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]&quot;, ''Blackadder'' was voted the second best British sitcom of all time, topped by ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''. It was also ranked as the 20th Best TV Show of All Time by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;empire&quot;/&gt;

==Future==
Despite regular statements denying any plans for a fifth series, cast members are regularly asked about the possibility of a new series.

In January 2005, Tony Robinson told [[ITV]]'s ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'' that Rowan Atkinson was more keen than he has been in the past to do a fifth series, set in the 1960s (centred on a rock band called the &quot;Black Adder Five&quot;, with [[Baldrick]] – aka 'Bald Rick' – as the drummer). Robinson in a stage performance 1 June 2007, again mentioned this idea, but in the context of a movie. One idea mentioned by Curtis was that it was Baldrick who had accidentally [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/3178382/Richard-Curtis-Blackadder-was-lined-up-to-be-Sixties-entrepreneur.html|title=Richard Curtis: Blackadder was lined up to be Sixties entrepreneur|publisher=[[Sunday Telegraph]]|date=12 October 2008|accessdate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, aside from a brief mention in June 2005,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-faces&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
there have been no further announcements from the BBC that a new series is being planned. Furthermore, in November 2005, Rowan Atkinson told ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'' that although he would very much like to do a new series set in [[Colditz]] or another [[prisoner-of-war camp]] during [[World War II]], something which both he and Stephen Fry reiterated at the end of ''Blackadder Rides Again'', the chances of it happening are extremely slim.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

There were a couple of ideas that had previously floated for the fifth series. ''Batadder'' was intended to be a parody of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' with Baldrick as the counterpart of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (suggested by [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]]). This idea eventually came to surface as part of the ''[[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]'' sketch &quot;[[Spider-Plant Man]]&quot; in 2005, with Atkinson as [[Spider-Man|the title hero]], Robinson as Robin, [[Jim Broadbent]] as Batman and [[Rachel Stevens]] as [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]]. ''Star Adder'' was to be set in space in the future (suggested by Atkinson),&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmtv.eserver.org/black-adder.txt &quot;Black Adder Program Guide&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; though this too was touched upon in ''Blackadder's Christmas Carol''.

On 10 April 2007, ''[[Hello!]]'' reported that Atkinson was moving forward with his ideas for a fifth series. He said, &quot;I like the idea of him being a prisoner of war in Colditz. That would have the right level of authority and hierarchy which is apparent in all the Blackadders.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hello-Colditz&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A post on [http://www.BlackAdderHall.com www.BlackAdderHall.com] from Ben Elton in early 2007 states that Blackadder will return in some form, whether it be a TV series or movie. Elton has since not given any more information on the putative ''Blackadder 5''.

During an interview in August 2007 regarding his latest movie, ''[[Mr. Bean's Holiday]]'', Atkinson was asked about the possibility of a further ''Blackadder'' series, to which the simple reply &quot;No, no chance&quot; was given:

:&quot;There was a plan for a film set in the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]], a very interesting one called ''The Red Adder''. He would have been a lieutenant in the Secret Police. Then the revolution happened and at the end he is in the same office doing the same job but just the colours on his uniform have changed. It was quite a sweet idea and we got quite a long way with it but in the end it died a death.&quot;

[[Stephen Fry]] has expressed the view that, since the series went out on such a good &quot;high&quot;, a film might not be a good idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/060620k.php &quot;Atkinson Developing &quot;Black Adder&quot; Film&quot;], [[Darkhorizons.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his June 2007 stage performance, chronicled on the Tony Robinson's Cunning Night Out DVD, Robinson states that after filming the ''Back &amp; Forth special'', the general idea was to reunite for another special in 2010. Robinson jokingly remarked that Hugh Laurie's success on ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' may make that difficult.

At the end of ''Blackadder Rides Again'' Robinson asked Tim McInnerny if he would do another series and he responded &quot;no&quot;, because he thought people wouldn't want to see them as they are now and would rather remember them for how they were. In the same documentary, Rowan Atkinson voiced his similar view; 'Times past; that's what they were!' However, Miranda Richardson and Tony Robinson expressed enthusiasm towards the idea of a series set in the Wild West, whilst John Lloyd favoured an idea for a series with a [[Neanderthal]] Blackadder. Lastly Stephen Fry suggested a series set during the [[Holocaust]] but later remarked that &quot;perhaps some things should be left alone.&quot;
Shortly afterwards in [[Comic Relief]] 2011 t-shirts with pictures of [[Lord Blackadder]] and [[Queenie]] were sold.

==Media availability==
*All series and many of the specials are available on DVD and [[VHS|video]], and as well many are available on BBC Audio Cassette. As of 2008 a &quot;Best of BBC&quot; edition box set is available containing all four major series together with ''Blackadder's Christmas Carol'' and ''Back &amp; Forth''. All 4 seasons and the Christmas special are also available for download on [[iTunes]].

The '''Boii''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] plural, singular ''Boius''; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{polytonic|Βόϊοι}}) were one of the most prominent [[Celts|ancient Celtic]] tribes of the later [[Iron Age]], attested at various times in [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (northern [[Italy]]), [[Pannonia]] ([[Hungary]] and its western neighbours), in and around [[Bohemia]], and [[Transalpine Gaul]]. In addition the archaeological evidence indicates that in the 2nd century BC Celts expanded from Bohemia through the Kłodzko valley into [[Silesia]], now part of [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rankin|1996|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They first appear in history in connection with the [[Campaign history of the Roman military#Celtic invasion of Italia (390–387 BC)|Gallic invasion of north Italy]], 390 BC, when they made the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] city of Felsina their new capital, [[Bologna|Bononia (Bologna)]]. After a series of wars they were decisively beaten by the Romans in a [[Battle of Mutina 193 BCE|battle near Mutina (Modena)]] and their territory became part of the Roman province of [[Cisalpine Gaul]]. According to [[Strabo]], writing two centuries after the events, rather than being destroyed by the Romans like their Celtic neighbours, &lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;the Boii were merely driven out of the regions they occupied; and after migrating to the regions round about the [[Danube|Ister]], lived with the [[Taurisci]], and carried on war against the [[Daci]] until they perished, tribe and all — and thus they left their country, which was a part of [[Illyria]], to their neighbours as a pasture-ground for sheep.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, 5.213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Around 60 BC, a group of Boians joined the [[Helvetii|Helvetians']] ill-fated attempt to conquer land in western Gaul and were defeated by [[Julius Caesar]], along with their allies, in the [[battle of Bibracte]]. Caesar settled the remnants of that group in [[Gorgobina]], from where they sent two thousand to [[Vercingetorix]]'s aid at the [[battle of Alesia]] six years later. The eastern Boians on the Danube were incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]] in 8 AD.

==Etymology and name==
From all the different names of the same Celtic people in literature and inscriptions it is possible to abstract a [[continental Celtic]] segment, boio-.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Continental Celtic Place-Names|editor-first=Alexander|editor-last=Falileyev|publisher=Aberystwyth University|year=2007|title=Boii|url=http://cadair.aber.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/2160/282/5/ContCelticPNDictionary.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two major derivations of this segment, both presupposing that it belongs to the family of [[Indo-European languages]]: from 'cow' and from 'warrior.' The Boii would thus be either &quot;the herding people&quot; or &quot;the warrior people.&quot;

The &quot;cow&quot; derivation depends most immediately on the [[Old Irish]] legal term for &quot;outsider:&quot; ''amboue'', from [[proto-Celtic]] *ambouios, &quot;not a cattle owner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=225|title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia|first=John T. |last=Koch|edition= illustrated|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2006|id=ISBN 1-85109-440-7, 9781851094400|location=Santa Barbara, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a reference to the first known historical Boii, [[Polybius]] relates&lt;ref name=PB.2.17&gt;''Histories'', II.17.&lt;/ref&gt; that their wealth consisted of cattle and gold, that they depended on agriculture and war, and that a man's status depended on the number of associates and assistants he had. The latter were presumably the *ambouii, as opposed to the man of status, who was *bouvios, a cattle owner, and the *bouii were originally a class, &quot;the cattle owners.&quot;

[[File:HallstattIlllyrianFootmanwithJavelins.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Depiction of a soldier wearing a plumed pot helmet, [[Hallstatt culture]] Bronze belt plaque from [[Vače]], [[Slovenia]], ca. 400 BC]]
The &quot;warrior&quot; derivation was adopted by the linguist, [[Julius Pokorny]], who presented it as being from Indo-European *bhei(ə)-, *bhī-, &quot;hit;&quot; however, not finding any Celtic names close to it (except for the Boii), he adduces examples somewhat more widely from originals further back in time: phohiio-s-, a [[Venetic]] personal name; Boioi, an [[Illyria]]n tribe; Boiōtoi, a Greek tribal name (&quot;the [[Boeotia]]ns&quot;) and a few others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|language=German|pages=117–118|encyclopedia=Indogermanisches Etymologisches Woerterbuch|first=Julius|last=Pokorny|authorlink=Julius Pokorny|title=bhei(ə)-, bhī-|url=http://www.indoeuropean.nl/|publisher=University of Leiden|date=1998-2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boii would be from the [[Apophony|o-grade]] of *bhei-, which is *bhoi-. Such a connection is possible if the original form of Boii belonged to a tribe of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] speakers long before the time of the historic Boii. The Celtic tribe of central Europe must in that case be a final daughter population of a linguistically diversifying ancestor tribe.

The same wider connections can be hypothesized for the &quot;cow&quot; derivation: the Boeotians have been known for well over a century as a people of kine, which might have been parallel to the meaning of [[Italy#Etymology|Italy]] as a &quot;land of calves.&quot; Indo-European reconstructions can be made using {{PIE|*gʷou-}} &quot;cow&quot; as a basis, such as {{PIE|*gʷowjeh³s}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birkhan|1999|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary derived words include ''[[Boiorix]]'' (&quot;king of the Boii&quot;, one of the chieftains of the [[Cimbri]]) and ''Boiodurum'' (&quot;gate/fort of the Boii&quot;, modern [[Passau]]) in Germany. Their memory also survives in the modern regional names of [[Bohemia]] (''Boiohaemum''), a mixed-language form from boio- and [[Proto-Germanic]] *''haimaz'', &quot;home&quot;: &quot;home of the Boii,&quot; and 'Bayern', [[Bavaria]], which is derived from the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ''Baiovarii'' tribe (Germ. ''*baio-warioz'': the first component is most plausibly explained as a Germanic version of ''Boii''; the second part is a common formational morpheme of Germanic tribal names, meaning 'dwellers', as in [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''-ware'');&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Indoeuropean short ''o'', as in the Celtic ''Boii'', developed to ''a'' in Germanic. As far as its formation is concerned, the name seems to be a hybrid between Celtic or Latin and Germanic, as the thematic vowel ''bai-'''''o'''- would have to be an ''a'' in a Germanic compound (cf. Celtic ''ambio-rix'' vs. Germanic ''þiuda-reiks'', &quot;Theoderic&quot;). This, however, should not be used as an argument against the 'traditional' etymology, as such forms are quite common (cf. ''Raetovarii'', an Allemanic tribe) and are most likely influenced by the Latin background of the ancient writers.&lt;/ref&gt; this combination &quot;Boii-dwellers&quot; may have meant &quot;those who dwell where the Boii formerly dwelt&quot;.

==History==
[[Image:Boians.png|upright=1.5|right|thumbnail|400px|Migratory movements of the Boii]]

===Settlement in north Italy===
According to the ancient authors, the Boii arrived in northern Italy by crossing the [[Alps]]. While of the other the tribes who had come to Italy along with the Boii, the [[Senones]], [[Lingones]] and [[Cenomani]] are also attested in Gaul at the time of the Roman conquest, there is no such clear evidence for the Boii in Gaul. It remains therefore unclear where exactly the [[Central Europe]]an origins of the Boii lay, if somewhere in Gaul, [[Southern Germany]] or in Bohemia.

[[Polybius]] relates that the Celts were close neighbors of the [[Etruscans]] and &quot;cast covetous eyes on their beautiful country.&quot;&lt;ref name=PB.2.17&gt;''Histories'', II.17.&lt;/ref&gt; Invading the [[Po valley]] with a large army they drove out the Etruscans and resettled it, the Boii taking the right bank in the center of the valley. [[Strabo]] confirms that the Boii emigrated from their lands across the [[Alps]]&lt;ref&gt;''Geography'', IV.4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and were one of the largest tribes of the Celts.&lt;ref&gt;''Geography'', V.1.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boii occupied the old Etruscan settlement of [[Felsina#History|Felsina]], which they named ''Bononia'' ([[Bologna]]). Polybius describes the Celtic way of life in Cisalpine Gaul as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;They lived in unwalled villages, without any superfluous furniture; for as they slept on beds of leaves and fed on meat and were exclusively occupied with war and agriculture, their lives were very simple, and they had no knowledge whatever of any art or science. Their possessions consisted of cattle and gold, because these were the only things they could carry about with them everywhere according to circumstances and shift where they chose. They treated comradeship as of the greatest importance, those among them being the most feared and most powerful who were thought to have the largest number of attendants and associates.&quot;''&lt;ref name=PB.2.17/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The archaeological evidence from Bologna and its vicinity contradicts the testimony of Polybius and Livy on some points, who say the Boii expelled the Etruscans and perhaps some were forced to leave. It much rather indicates that the Boii neither destroyed nor depopulated Felsinum, but simply moved in and became part of the population by intermarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=201–202|title=Beyond the Rubicon: Romans and Gauls in Republican Italy|first=J. H. C.|last= Williams|edition=illustrated|publisher= Oxford University Press|year=2001|id=ISBN 0-19-815300-7, 9780198153009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cemeteries of the period in Bologna contain [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] weapons and other artifacts, as well as Etruscan items such as bronze mirrors. At [[Pianoro|Monte Bibele]] not far away one grave contained La Tène weapons and a pot with an Etruscan female name scratched on it.

===War against Rome===
In the second half of the 3rd century BC, the Boii allied with the other Cisalpine Gauls and the Etruscans against Rome. They also fought alongside [[Hannibal]], killing (in 216 BC) the Roman general [[Lucius Postumius Albinus (consul 234 and 229 BC)|L. Postumius Albinus]], whose skull was then turned into a sacrificial bowl.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Rome'', XXIII, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; A short time earlier, they had been defeated at [[Battle of Telamon (224 BC)|Telamon]] in 224 BC, and were again later at [[Battle of Placentia (194 BC)|Placentia in 194 BC]] (modern [[Piacenza]]) and [[Battle of Mutina 193 BCE|Mutina in 193 BC]] (modern [[Modena]]). After the loss of their capital, according to Strabo, a large portion of the Boii left Italy.

===Boii on the Danube===
Contrary to the interpretation of the classical writers, the Pannonian Boii attested in later sources are not simply the remnants of those who had fled from Italy, but rather another division of the tribe, which had settled there much earlier. The burial rites of the Italian Boii show many similarities with contemporary Bohemia, such as [[inhumation]], which was uncommon with the other Cisalpine Gauls, or the absence of the typically western Celtic [[torc]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe, Barry: &quot;The Ancient Celts&quot;, Penguin Books 1999, pp. 72f.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it much more likely that the Cisalpine Boii had actually originated from Bohemia rather than the other way round.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birkhan|1999|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having migrated to Italy from north of the Alps, some of the defeated Celts simply moved back to their kinsfolk.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Other tribes of whom divisions are attested both in the 'Celtic homeland' and at the periphery include the Senones (Umbria and the Marne region), Lingones (Aemilia and the Langres plateau), Cenomani (Venetia and Maine), Tectosages (Galatia and Provence).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pannonian Boii are mentioned again in the late 2nd century BC when they repelled the [[Cimbri]] and [[Teutones]] (Strabo VII, 2, 2). Later on, they attacked the city of [[Noreia]] (in modern Austria) shortly before a group of Boii (32,000 according to [[Julius Caesar]] - the number is probably an exaggeration) joined the [[Helvetii]] in their attempt to settle in western Gaul. After the Helvetian defeat at [[Bibracte]], the influential [[Aedui]] tribe allowed the Boii survivors to settle on their territory, where they occupied the ''oppidum'' of [[Gorgobina]]. Although attacked by [[Vercingetorix]] during one phase of the war, they supported him with two thousand troops at the battle of [[Alesia]] (Caes. Bell. Gall., VII, 75).

Again, other parts of the Boii had remained closer to their traditional home, and settled in the Slovak and [[Hungary|Hungarian lowlands]] by the [[Danube]] and the [[Mur River|Mura]], with a centre at [[Bratislava]]. Around 60 BC they clashed with the rising power of the [[Dacians]] under their king [[Burebista]] and were defeated. When the Romans finally conquered [[Pannonia]] in 8 AD, the Boii seem not to have opposed them. Their former territory was now called ''deserta Boiorum'' (deserta meaning 'empty or sparsely populated lands').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birkhan|1999|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Boii had not been exterminated: There was a ''civitas Boiorum et Azaliorum'' (the Azalii being a neighbouring tribe) which was under the jurisdiction of a prefect of the Danube shore (''praefectus ripae Danuvii'').&lt;ref&gt;[[CIL]] IX 5363)&lt;/ref&gt; This civitas, a common Roman  administrative term designating both a city and the tribal district around it, was later adjoined to the city of [[Carnuntum]].

==The Boii in ancient sources==
===Plautus===
[[Plautus]] refers to the Boii in ''[[Captivi]]'':
:''At nunc Siculus non est, Boius est, Boiam terit''
:But now he is not a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] — he is a Boian, he has got a Boian woman.
There is a play on words: ''Boia'' means &quot;woman of the Boii&quot;, also &quot;convicted criminal's restraint collar&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Titus Maccius |last=Plautus |title=Amphitryo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Bacchides, Captivi |first2=Paul, Translator |last2=Nixon |publisher=Gutenberg Project | year=2005 |origyear=1916 |id=EBook No. 16564 |page=890 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Livy===
In volume 21 of his work ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', [[Livy]] (59 BC - 17 AD) claims that it was a Boian man that offered to show [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]] the way across the [[Alps]].
:When, after the action had thus occurred, his own men returned to each general, [[Publius Cornelius Scipio|Scipio]] could adopt no fixed plan of proceeding, except that he should form his measures from the plans and undertakings of the enemy: and Hannibal, uncertain whether he should pursue the march he had commenced into [[Italy]], or fight with the Roman army which had first presented itself, the arrival of ambassadors from the Boii, and of a petty prince called [[Magalus]], diverted from an immediate engagement; who, declaring that they would be the guides of his journey and the companions of his dangers, gave it as their opinion, that Italy ought to be attacked with the entire force of the war, his strength having been nowhere previously impaired.

===Inscriptions===
In the 1st century BC, the Boii living in an [[enclosed oppidum|oppidum]] of [[Bratislava]] (Slovakia) minted [[Biatec]]s, high-quality coins with inscriptions (probably the names of kings) in Latin letters. This is the only &quot;written source&quot; provided by the Boii themselves.

'''Backgammon''' is one of the oldest [[board game]]s for two players. The playing pieces are moved according to the roll of [[dice]], and players win by removing all of their pieces from the board. There are many variants of backgammon, most of which share common traits. Backgammon is a member of the [[Tables (board game)|tables]] family, one of the oldest classes of board games in the world.

Although luck is involved and factors into the outcome, strategy plays a more important role in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammonluckskill &quot;Backgammon Luck ''vs'' Skill&quot;], backgammon.org&lt;/ref&gt; With each roll of the dice players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent. Players may raise the stakes during the game. There is an established repertoire of common tactics and occurrences.

Like [[chess]], backgammon has been studied with great interest by [[Computer science|computer scientists]]. Owing to this research, backgammon software has been developed capable of beating world-class human players.

==Rules==
[[Image:Bg-movement.svg|thumb|Paths of movement for red and black, with checkers in the starting position]]
Backgammon playing pieces are known variously as [[draughts|checkers, draughts]], stones, men, [[Boardgame counter|counters]], pawns, or chips.

The objective is to remove (bear off) all of one's own checkers from the board before one's opponent can do the same. The checkers are scattered at first and may be blocked or hit by the opponent. As the playing time for each individual game is short, it is often played in matches, where [[victory]] is awarded to the first player to reach a certain number of points.

===Setup===
Each side of the board has a track of 12 long triangles, called points. The points are considered to be connected across one edge of the board, forming a continuous track in the shape of a [[horseshoe]], and are numbered from 1 to 24. Players begin with two checkers on their 24-point, three checkers on their 8-point, and five checkers each on their 13-point and their 6-point. The two players move their checkers in opposing directions, from the 24-point towards the 1-point.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-winners&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Robertie |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Robertie |title=Backgammon for Winners |edition=Third |year=2002 |publisher=Cardoza |isbn=1-58042-043-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Points 1 through 6 are called the home board or inner board, and points 7 through 12 are called the outer board. The 7-point is referred to as the bar point, and the 13-point as the mid point.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-winners&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Hoyle's Rules of Games |edition=Third Revised and Updated |publisher=Signet |year=2001 |pages=321–330 |isbn=0-451-20484-0 |author=edited by Albert H. Morehead and Geoffrey Mott-Smith.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement===

[[File:Backgammon example.ogv|thumb|Video of a game of backgammon, showing movement around the board, entering from the bar, formation of primes, use of the doubling cube and bearing off]]

A player may only stack 6 stones on the same point. In no case are you allowed to put more than the max amount on the same place.
To start the game, each player rolls one die, and the player with the higher number moves first using both the numbers shown. If the players roll the same number, they must roll again as the first move can not be a double. Both dice must land completely flat on the right hand side of the gameboard. The players then alternate turns, rolling two dice at the beginning of each turn.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-winners&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt;

After rolling the dice players must, if possible, move their checkers according to the number of pips shown on each die. For example, if the player rolls a 6 and a 3 (notated as &quot;6-3&quot;), that player must move one checker six points forward, and another or the same checker three points forward. The same checker may be moved twice as long as the two moves are distinct: six and then three, or three and then six. If a player rolls two of the same number, called doubles, that player must play each die twice. For example, upon rolling a 5-5 that player may move up to four separate checkers forward five spaces each. For any roll, if a player can move both dice, that player is compelled to do so.  If players cannot move either die in a roll, given the position of their checkers then that turn is over and the turn passes to the opponent. In order to score in this game you must role exactly the amount of spaces to leave the game board. If you role a number more than the amount of spaces, you forfeit your turn.

If it is possible to move either die, but not both, the higher number must be played. For example if a player rolls 6-3 and can only move a 6 or a 3, the 6 being the bigger number must be moved; if it is possible to move the 3 but not the 6 then the 3 is played.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-winners&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt; Further, if one die is unable to be moved, but such a move is made possible by the moving of the other die, that move is compulsory.

In the course of a move, a checker may land on any point that is unoccupied or is occupied only by a player's own checkers. It may also land on a point occupied by exactly one opposing checker, or &quot;blot&quot;.  In this case, the blot has been hit, and is placed in the middle of the board on the bar that divides the two sides of the playing surface.  A checker may never land on a point occupied by two or more opposing checkers; thus, no point is ever occupied by checkers from both players simultaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-winners&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt;

Checkers placed on the bar re-enter the game through the opponent's home board. A roll of 2 allows the checker to enter on the 23-point, a roll of 3 on the 22-point, and so forth. A player may not move any other checkers until all checkers on the bar belonging to that player have re-entered the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-winners&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt;

When all of a player's checkers are in that player's home board, that player may start removing them; this is called bearing off. A roll of 1 may be used to bear off a checker from the 1-point, a 2 from the 2-point, and so on. A die may not be used to bear off checkers from a lower-numbered point unless there are no checkers on any higher points.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-winners&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt; For example if a player rolls a 6 and a 5, but has no checkers on the 6-point, though 2 checkers remain on the 5-point, then the 6 and the 5 must be used to bear off the 2 checkers from the 5-point. When bearing off, a player may also move a lower die roll before the higher even if that means 'the full value of the higher die' is not fully utilized. For example, if a player has exactly 1 checker remaining on the 6-point, and rolls a 6 and a 1, the player may move the 6-point checker 1 place to the 5-point with the lower die roll of 1, and then bear that checker off the 5-point using the die roll of 6; this is sometimes useful tactically.

If one player has not borne off any checkers by the time that player's opponent has borne off all fifteen, then the player has lost '''a gammon''', which counts for double a normal loss. If the losing player has not borne off any checkers and still has checkers on the bar or in the opponent's home board, then the player has lost '''a backgammon''', which counts for triple a normal loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-winners&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt;

===Doubling cube===
[[Image:Backgammon DoublingCube.jpg|thumb|Doubling cube]]
To speed up match play and to provide an added dimension for strategy, a doubling cube is usually used. The doubling cube is not a die to be rolled but rather a marker, in the form of a cube with the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 inscribed on its sides, denoting the current stake. At the start of each game, the doubling cube is placed on the bar with the number 64 showing;  the cube is then said to be &quot;centered, on 1&quot;. When the cube is centered, the player about to roll may propose that the game be played for twice the current stakes. His opponent must either accept (&quot;take&quot;) the doubled stakes or resign (&quot;drop&quot;) the game immediately. If the opponent takes, the cube, now showing the doubled stake, is moved to the opponent's side of the board.  This is done to indicate that the right to re-double belongs exclusively to the player who last accepted a double. Whenever a player accepts doubled stakes, the cube is placed on his side of the board with the corresponding [[power of two]] facing upward.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-winners&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoyle&quot;/&gt; If the opponent drops the doubled stakes, he loses the game at the current value of the doubling cube. For instance, if the cube showed the number 2 and a player wanted to redouble the stakes to put it at 4, the opponent choosing to drop the redouble would lose two, or twice the original stake.

The game is rarely redoubled beyond four times the original stake, but there is no limit on the number of redoubles. Although 64 is the highest number depicted on the doubling cube, the stakes may rise to 128, 256, and so on. In money games, a player is often permitted to &quot;'''beaver'''&quot; when offered the cube, doubling the value of the game again, while retaining possession of the cube.&lt;ref name=&quot;bill_robertie-beavers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gammonvillage.com/backgammon/news/early_beavers.cfm |title=Backgammon Beavers |accessdate=2007-10-17 |last=Robertie |first=Bill |publisher=GammonVillage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of the doubling cube &quot;beaver&quot; is the &quot;'''raccoon'''.&quot; Players who doubled their opponent, seeing the opponent beaver the cube, may in turn then double the stakes once again (&quot;raccoon&quot;) as part of that cube phase before any dice are rolled. The opponent retains the doubling cube. E.g. White doubles Black to 2 points, Black accepts then beavers the cube to 4 points; White, confident of a win, raccoons the cube to 8 points, whilst Black retains the cube. Such a move adds greatly to the risk of having to face the doubling cube coming back at 8 times its original value when first doubling the opponent (offered at 2 points, counter offered at 16 points) should the luck of the dice change.

Some players may opt to invoke '''The Murphy rule''' or the &quot;automatic double rule.&quot; If both opponents roll the same opening number, the doubling cube is incremented on each occasion yet remains in the middle of the board, available to either player. The Murphy rule may be invoked with a maximum number of automatic doubles allowed and that limit is agreed to prior to a game or match commencing. When a player decides to double the opponent, the value is then a double of whatever face value is shown (e.g. if two automatic doubles have occurred putting the cube up to 4, the first in-game double will be for 8 points).  The Murphy rule is not an official rule in backgammon and is rarely, if ever, seen in use at officially sanctioned tournaments.

The '''Jacoby rule''', named after [[Oswald Jacoby]], allows gammons and backgammons to count for their respective double and triple values only if the cube has already been offered and accepted. This encourages a player with a large lead to double, possibly ending the game, rather than to play it to conclusion hoping for a gammon or backgammon. The Jacoby rule is widely used in money play but is not used in match play.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-serious&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Robertie |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Robertie |title=Backgammon for Serious Players |edition=Second |year=2006 |pages=19–22 |publisher=Cardoza |isbn=0-940685-68-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Crawford rule''', named after [[John R. Crawford]], is designed to make match play more equitable for the player in the lead. If a player is one point away from winning a match, that player's opponent will always want to double as early as possible in order to catch up. Whether the game is worth one point or two, the trailing player must win to continue the match. To balance the situation, the Crawford rule requires that when a player first reaches a score one point short of winning, neither player may use the doubling cube for the following game, called the '''Crawford game'''. After the Crawford game, normal use of the doubling cube resumes. The Crawford rule is routinely used in tournament match play.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-serious&quot;/&gt;  It is possible for a Crawford game never to occur in a match.

If the Crawford rule is in effect, then another option is the '''Holland rule''', which stipulates that after the Crawford game, a player cannot double until after at least two rolls have been played by each side. It was common in tournament play in the 1980s but is now rarely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bkgm.com/gloss/lookup.cgi?pat=holland+rule |title=Backgammon Glossary/Holland Rule |publisher=Bkgm.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variants===
[[Image:Alfonso-todas-tablas.jpg|thumb|''Todas tablas'' from the [[Libro de los juegos]]]]
{{Main|Tables (board game)}}
There are many variants of standard backgammon rules. Some are played primarily throughout one geographic region, and others add new tactical elements to the game. Variants commonly alter the starting position, restrict certain moves, or assign special value to certain dice rolls, but in some geographic regions even the rules and directions of the checkers movement change, rendering the game fundamentally different.

'''[[Acey-deucey]]''' is a variant of backgammon in which players start with no checkers on the board, and must bear them on at the beginning of the game. The roll of 1-2 is given special consideration, allowing the player, after moving the 1 and the 2, to select any desired doubles move. A player also receives an extra turn after a roll of 1-2 or of doubles.&lt;ref&gt;The Backgammon Book, Chapter 11, O. Jacoby &amp; J.R. Crawford, 1970, Macmillan &amp; co&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypergammon''' is a variant of backgammon in which players have only three checkers on the board, starting with one each on the 24-, 23- and 22-points. The game has been [[solved game|strongly solved]], meaning that exact [[expected value|equities]] are available for all 32 million possible positions.&lt;ref name=Tesauro2002&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tesauro, G. | year = 2002 | title = Programming backgammon using self-teaching neural nets | journal = Artificial Intelligence | volume = 134 | issue = 1 | pages = 181–199| url = http://www.math-info.univ-paris5.fr/~bouzy/Doc/PJR/Backgammon.pdf  | accessdate = 2007-08-08 | doi = 10.1016/S0004-3702(01)00110-2 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;strato-variants&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gammonlife.com/variants/index.htm |title=Backgammon Variants |accessdate=2007-08-08 |last=Strato |first=Michael |publisher=Gammonlife }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nackgammon''' is a variant of backgammon invented by Nick &quot;Nack&quot; Ballard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.flash.net/~markthom/html/nackgammon.html|title=Nackgammon |accessdate=2009-02-04 |last=Thompson |first=Mark |publisher=mindfun }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which players start with one fewer checker on the six point and midpoint and two checkers on the 23 point.&lt;ref name=&quot;strato-variants&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gammonline.com/members/Sep01/articles/nackg.htm |title=Nackgammon |accessdate=2007-08-08 |last=Woolsey |first=Kit |date=September 2001|publisher=Gammonline }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russian backgammon''' is a variant in which players start with no checkers on the board, and both players move in the same direction to bear off in a common home board.  In this variant, doubles are more powerful: four moves are played as in standard backgammon, followed by four moves according to the difference of the dice value from 7, and then the player has another turn (with a few exceptions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bkgm.com/variants/RussianBackgammon.html |title=Russian Backgammon |publisher=Bkgm.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Gul bara|Gul Bara]]''' and '''[[Tapa (game)|Tapa]]''' are also variants of the game popular in southeastern Europe and Turkey. The play will iterate among Backgammon, Gul Bara, and Tapa until one of the players reaches a score of 7 or 5.

Another simple variant of Backgammon is to only allow a maximum of five checkers on any point. This variation is not part of the official rules, but has proved popular with casual players in some regions (e.g., Britain).&lt;ref&gt;Discussion at [http://www.bkgm.com/rgb/rgb.cgi?view+130 bkgm.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy and tactics==
[[Image:Backgammon-set from American civil war.jpeg|thumb|Backgammon set, 19th century]]

Backgammon has an established [[Backgammon opening theory|opening theory]], although it is less detailed than that of games like chess. The [[Game tree|tree]] of positions expands rapidly because of the number of possible dice rolls and the moves available on each turn. Recent computer analysis has offered more insight on opening plays, but the midgame is reached quickly. After the opening, backgammon players frequently rely on some established general strategies, combining and switching among them to adapt to the changing conditions of a game.

The most direct strategy is simply to avoid being hit, trapped, or held in a stand-off.  A &quot;running game&quot; describes a strategy of moving as quickly as possible around the board, and is most successful when a player is already ahead in the race.&lt;ref name=&quot;magriel&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Magriel |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Magriel |title=Backgammon |year=1976 |publisher=Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Co |isbn= 0-8129-0615-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this fails, one may opt for a &quot;holding game&quot;, maintaining control of a point on one's opponent's side of the board, called an anchor. As the game progresses, this player may gain an advantage by hitting an opponent's blot from the anchor, or by rolling large doubles that allow the checkers to escape into a running game.&lt;ref name=&quot;magriel&quot;/&gt;

The &quot;priming game&quot; involves building a wall of checkers, called a prime, covering a number of consecutive points. This obstructs opposing checkers that are behind the prime. A checker trapped behind a six-point prime cannot escape until the prime is broken.&lt;ref name=&quot;magriel&quot;/&gt; A particularly successful priming effort may lead to a &quot;blitz&quot;, which is a strategy of covering the entire home board as quickly as possible while keeping one's opponent on the bar. Because the opponent has difficulty re-entering from the bar or escaping, a player can quickly gain a running advantage and win the game, often with a gammon.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-winners&quot;/&gt;

A &quot;backgame&quot; is a strategy of placing two or more anchors in an opponent's home board, while building a prime in one's own board. The anchors obstruct the opponent's checkers and create opportunities to hit them as they move home. The backgame is generally used only to salvage a game wherein a player is already significantly behind; using a backgame as an initial strategy is usually unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-winners&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;magriel&quot;/&gt;

&quot;Duplication&quot; refers to the placement of checkers such that one's opponent needs the same dice rolls to achieve different goals. For example, players may position all of their blots in such a way that the opponent must roll a 2 in order to hit any of them, reducing the probability of being hit more than once.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-winners&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;magriel&quot;/&gt; &quot;Diversification&quot; refers to a complementary tactic of placing one's own checkers in such a way that more numbers are useful.&lt;ref name=&quot;magriel&quot;/&gt;

Many positions require a measurement of a player's standing in the race, for example, in making a doubling cube decision, or in determining whether to run home and begin bearing off. The minimum total of dice rolls needed to move a player's checkers around and off the board is called the &quot;pip count&quot;. The difference between the two players' pip counts is frequently used as a measure of the leader's racing advantage. Players often use [[mental calculation]] techniques to determine pip counts in live play.&lt;ref name=&quot;magriel&quot;/&gt;

==Social and competitive play==
[[Image:Wurfzabel.jpg|thumb|Medieval players, from the 13th century [[Carmina Burana]]]]

===Club and tournament play===
Enthusiasts have formed [[club]]s for social play of backgammon. Local clubs may hold informal gatherings, with members meeting at cafés and bars in the evening to play and converse.&lt;ref name=&quot;sydney&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Tribes of Sydney—Sydney Backgammon Club |work=The Daily Telegraph (Australia) |date=June 24, 2006 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bray1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Bray |first=Chris |title=Backgammon |work=The Independent (London) |date=June 29, 2002 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few clubs offer additional services, maintaining their own facilities or offering computer analysis of troublesome plays.&lt;ref name=&quot;bray2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Bray |first=Chris |title=Backgammon |work=The Independent (London) |date=November 25, 2000 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some club leaders have noticed a recent growth of interest in backgammon, and attribute it to the game's popularity on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;laverty&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Laverty |first=Roy |title=Backgammon warriors—columnist, club member square off as board game's popularity grows |work=The Alameda Times-Star (Section: Bay Area Living)|date=May 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[backgammon chouette]] permits three or more players to participate in a single game, often for money. One player competes against a team of all the other participants, and positions rotate after each game. Chouette play often permits the use of multiple doubling cubes.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-winners&quot;/&gt;

Backgammon clubs may also organize [[tournaments]]. Large club tournaments sometimes draw competitors from other regions, with final matches viewed by hundreds of spectators.&lt;ref name=&quot;magriel-nyt&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Magriel |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Magriel |title=Backgammon: Before Planning Big Attack, Be Sure to Cover Your Rear |work=The New York Times, Late City Final Edition |date=June 1, 1980 |pages=50, section 1, part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top players at regional tournaments often compete in major national and international championships. Winners at major tournaments may receive prizes of tens of thousands of [[US dollar|dollars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;maxa&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Maxa |first=Rudy |authorlink=Rudy Maxa |title=Where the Rich And the Royal Play Their Games—Monte Carlo's Seven-Day Backgammon Soiree With Countesses, Princes and Other Sharpies |work=The Washington Post |date=September 6, 1981 |page=H1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International competition===
{{See also|List of World Backgammon champions}}
The first world championship competition in backgammon was held in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], Nevada in 1967. [[Tim Holland (backgammon)|Tim Holland]] was declared the winner that year and at the tournament the following year. For unknown reasons, there was no championship in 1969 or 1970, but in 1971, Tim Holland again won the title. The competition remained in Las Vegas until 1975, when it moved to [[Paradise Island]] in the [[Bahamas]]. The years 1976, 1977 &amp; 1978 saw &quot;dual&quot; World Championships, one in the Bahamas attended by the Americans, and the ''European Open Championships'' in [[Monte Carlo]] with mostly European players. In 1979, Lewis Deyong, who had promoted the Bahamas World Championship for the prior three years, suggested that the two events be combined.&lt;ref name=PLAY65&gt;[http://www.play65.com/World-Backgammon-Championships-History.html] Play65, The History of the World Backgammon Championships&lt;/ref&gt; Monte Carlo was universally acknowledged as the site of the World Backgammon Championship and has remained as such for thirty years.&lt;ref name=&quot;mindzine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/classic/bg/tournaments/world00report.html |title=Backgammon News—World Championships 2000 |author=Michael Crane |publisher=Mind Sports Worldwide| date=July 25, 2000 |accessdate=2006-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monte Carlo tournament draws hundreds of players and spectators, and is played over the course of a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;maxa&quot;/&gt;

By the 21st century, the largest international tournaments had established the basis of a tour for top professional players. Major tournaments are held yearly worldwide. [[PartyGaming]] sponsored the first [[World Series of Backgammon]] in 2006 from Cannes and later the 'Backgammon Million' tournament held in the [[Bahamas]] in January 2007 with a prize pool of one million dollars, the largest for any tournament to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;partygammon&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=PartyGammon.com to Stage First Ever US$1 Million Backgammon Tournament |work=PR Newswire |date=July 10, 2006 |publisher=[[Lexis-Nexis]] |accessdate=2006-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[World Series of Backgammon]] ran the world's largest international events in London, the UK Masters, the biggest tournament ever held in the UK with 128 international class players; the Nordic Open which instantly became the largest in the world with around 500 players in all flights and 153 in the Championship, and Cannes, which hosted the Riviera Cup, the traditional follow-up tournament to the World Championships. Cannes also hosted the WSOB Championship, the WSOB finale which saw 16 players play three-point shootout matches for €160,000. The event was recorded for television in Europe airing on Eurosport.

The [http://www.world-backgammon-association.com World Backgammon Association (WBA)] has been holding the biggest backgammon Tour of the circuit since 2007, the &quot;European Backgammon Tour&quot; (EBGT), regrouping tournaments such as &quot;Portuguese Open&quot;, &quot;Georgian Open&quot;, &quot;French Open&quot;, &quot;Cyprus Open&quot;, &quot;City of Venice&quot;, etc. With a total payout of around US$1,000,000, it is the richest circuit in backgammon, bringing the best players of the world together. WBA also stages the &quot;US Open&quot; and other events around the globe. WBA has contributed to a high stakes event called &quot;Crowns Cup&quot; broadcast on several TV-channels.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  In 2011, the WBA has announced collaborating with the online backgammon provider [[Play65]] for the 2011 season of the European Backgammon Tour. The [http://play65ebgt.com/index.html Play65/EBGT] season has eight stops, seven in several European locations and one in the US (in collaboration with the [http://www.chicagopoint.com/abt.html American Backgammon Tour]), and a corresponding number of online qualifiers. The season will be finished with a Grand Finale in [[Lefkosa]], [[Northern Cyprus]], where €25,000 will be split between the three finalists.

===Gambling===
When backgammon is [[Gambling|played for money]], the most common arrangement is to assign a monetary value to each point, and to play to a certain score, or until either player chooses to stop. The stakes are raised by gammons, backgammons, and use of the doubling cube. Backgammon is sometimes available in [[casino]]s. Before the commercialization of [[neural network]] programs, [[proposition bet]]s on specific positions were very common among backgammon players and gamblers.&lt;ref&gt;Wachtel, Robert [http://www.backgammon.org/articles/backgammon-proposition-week/ &quot;Backgammon Proposition&quot;] backgammon.org&lt;/ref&gt; As with most gambling games, successful play requires a combination of luck and skill, as a single dice roll can sometimes significantly change the outcome of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;magriel&quot;/&gt;

==Software==
===Play and analysis===
[[Image:GNU bg screenshot.png|thumb|A screen shot of GNU Backgammon, showing an evaluation and rollout of possible moves]]
Backgammon has been studied considerably by [[Computer science|computer scientists]]. [[Artificial neural network|Neural networks]] and other approaches have offered significant advances to software for gameplay and analysis.

The first strong computer opponent was BKG 9.8. It was written by [[Hans Berliner]] in the late 1970s on a DEC [[PDP-10]] as an experiment in evaluating board game positions. Early versions of BKG played badly even against poor players, but Berliner noticed that its critical mistakes were always at transitional phases in the game. He applied principles of [[fuzzy logic]] to improve its play between phases, and by July 1979, BKG 9.8 was strong enough to play against the reigning world champion [[Luigi Villa]]. It won the match, 7–1, becoming the first computer program to defeat a world champion in any board game. Berliner stated that the victory was largely a matter of luck, as the computer received more favorable dice rolls.&lt;ref name=&quot;berliner-acm&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berliner |first=Hans |title=Backgammon program beats world champ |journal=ACM SIGART Bulletin |issue=69 |month=January |year=1980 |pages=6–9 |doi=10.1145/1056433.1056434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, backgammon programmers found more success with an approach based on [[artificial neural network]]s. [[TD-Gammon]], developed by Gerald Tesauro of [[IBM]], was the first of these programs to play near the expert level. Its neural network was trained using [[temporal difference learning]] applied to data generated from self-play.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesauro-acm&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tesauro |first=Gerald |url=http://www.research.ibm.com/massive/tdl.html |title=Temporal difference learning and TD-Gammon |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=38 |issue=3 |month=March |year=1995 |pages=58–68 |doi=10.1145/203330.203343}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to assessments by [[Bill Robertie]] and [[Kit Woolsey]], TD-Gammon's play was at or above the level of the top human players in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesauro-acm&quot;/&gt; Woolsey said of the program that &quot;There is no question in my mind that its positional judgment is far better than mine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tesauro-acm&quot;/&gt;

Tesauro proposed using rollout analysis to compare the performance of computer algorithms against human players.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tesauro2002&quot;/&gt; In this method, a Monte-Carlo evaluation of positions is conducted (typically thousands of trials) where different random dice sequences are simulated. The rollout score of the human (or the computer) is the difference of the average game results by following the selected move versus following the best move, then averaged for the entire set of taken moves.

Neural network research has resulted in three modern [[Proprietary software|proprietary programs]], JellyFish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jellyfish-backgammon.com/ |title=Jellyfish |publisher=Jellyfish-backgammon.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowie&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgsnowie.com Snowie]&lt;/ref&gt; and eXtreme Gammon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extremegammon.com eXtreme Gammon]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[shareware]] BGBlitz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgblitz.com |title=BGBlitz |publisher=BGBlitz |date= |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[free software]] GNU Backgammon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnubg.org GNU Backgammon].&lt;/ref&gt; These programs not only play the game, but offer tools for analyzing games and offering detailed comparisons of individual moves. The strength of these programs lies in their neural networks' weights tables, which are the result of months of training. Without them, these programs play no better than a human novice. For the bearoff phase, backgammon software usually relies on a database containing precomputed equities for all possible bearoff positions.

===Internet play===
Backgammon software has been developed not only to play and analyze games, but also to facilitate play between humans over the [[internet]]. Dice rolls are provided by [[random number generator|random]] or [[pseudorandom number generator]]s. Real-time online play began with the [[First Internet Backgammon Server]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;fibs-hist&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Schneider |first=Andreas |coauthors=et al. |url=http://www.fibs.com/guide.html#history |title=Brief history of FIBS |publisher=FIBS, the First Internet Backgammon Server |accessdate=2006-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the longest running non-commercial backgammon server and retains an international community of backgammon players.

Excavations at [[Shahr-e Sokhteh]] ([[Persian language|Persian]] شهر سوخته , literally &quot;The Burnt City&quot;) in [[Iran]] have shown that a similar game existed there around 3000 BC. The artifacts include two dice and 60 checkers, and the set is believed to be 100 to 200 years older than the sets found in Ur, and on the board found at Shahr-e Sokhteh the fields are fashioned by the coils of a snake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payvand&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/04/dec/1029.html |title=World's Oldest Backgammon Discovered In Burnt City  |work=Payvand News |date=December 4, 2004 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica board game &quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Schädler , Dunn-Vaturi |first= Ulrich , Anne-Elizabeth | title= BOARD GAMES in pre-Islamic Persia | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=2010-05-07|url=http://www.iranica.com/articles/board-games-in-pre-islamic-persia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Touraj Daryaee]] (2006)— on the subject of the first written mention of early precursors of backgammon—writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The game of backgammon is first mentioned in Bhartrhari’s ''Vairagyasataka'' (p. 39), composed around the late sixth or early seventh century AD. The use of dice for the game is another indication of its Indic origin, since dice and gambling were a favorite pastime in ancient India. The rules of the game, however, first appeared in the [[Middle Persian]] text ''Wızarisnı Catrang ud Nihisnı New Ardaxsır'' (Explanation of Chess and Invention of Backgammon), composed in the sixth century during the rule of the Sasanian king Khosrow I (530–571). The text assigns its invention to the Persian sage Wuzurgmihr (Persian) [[Burzoe|Buzarjumihr/Bozorgmehr]], who was the minister of King [[Khosrau I|Khosrow I]], as a challenge for the Indian sages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daryaee, Touraj (2006) in &quot;Backgammon&quot; in ''Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia'' ed. Meri, Josef W. &amp; Bacharach, Jere L, pp. 88-89. Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 11th century ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the [[Persia]]n poet [[Ferdowsi]] credits [[Burzoe]] with the invention of the tables game ''nard'' in the 6th century. He describes an encounter between Burzoe and a [[Raja]] visiting from India. The Raja introduces the game of [[chess]], and Burzoe demonstrates ''nard'', played with dice made from [[ivory]] and [[teak]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wilkinson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilkinson |first=Charles K |title=Chessmen and Chess |journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |volume=New Series 1 |issue=9 |month=May |year=1943 |pages=271–279 |doi=10.2307/3257111 |url=http://jstor.org/stable/3257111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;murray&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Murray |first=Harold James Ruthven |authorlink=Harold James Ruthven Murray |title=A History of Board-Games Other than Chess |publisher=Hacker Art Books |year=1952 |isbn=0-87817-211-4 |chapter=6: Race-Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Nard is the name for the Persian version of backgammon, which has different initial positions and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranian.com/Alimagham/2006/February/Backgammon/index.html, &quot;Backgammon, or Takheth Nard&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; H.J.R.

===Egypt and Iraq===
Board games have existed for millennia in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Southwest Asia]]. The ancient Egyptian game [[senet]], was excavated, along with illustrations, from ancient Egyptian royal tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayes |first=William C.|title=Egyptian Tomb Reliefs of the Old Kingdom |journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |volume=New Series 4 |issue=7 |month=March |year=1946. |pages=170–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Game of Ur]], played in ancient [[Mesopotamia]], may also be an ancestor of modern day table games.

===Rome===
The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] played a number of games remarkably similar to backgammon. ''[[Ludus duodecim scriptorum]]'' (&quot;Game of twelve lines&quot;) used a board with three rows of 12 points each, and the checkers were moved across all three rows according to the roll of dice. Little specific text about the gameplay has survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;austin-roman1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Austin |first=Roland G. |title=Roman Board Games. I |journal=Greece &amp; Rome |volume=4 |issue=10 |month=October |year=1934 |pages=24–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tabula]]'', meaning &quot;table&quot; or &quot;board&quot;, was a game mentioned in an epigram of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] (AD 476–481). It was similar to modern backgammon in that the object of the game was to be the first to bear off all of one's checkers. Players threw three dice and moved their checkers in opposing directions on a board of 24 points.&lt;ref name=&quot;austin-roman2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Austin |first=Roland G. |title=Roman Board Games.

===East Asia===
It was popular for a time but then replaced by other games such as the chess variant [[Xiangqi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cctv.com/special/zgctty/20070605/107991.shtml [博弈篇&amp;#93;舶来棋戏——双陆]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The ''jeux de tables'' (Games of Tables), predecessors of modern backgammon, first appeared in France during the 11th Century and became a favorite pastime of gamblers. In 1254, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] issued a decree prohibiting his court officials and subjects from playing.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lillich&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lillich |first=Meredith Parsons |title=The Tric-Trac Window of Le Mans |journal=The Art Bulletin |volume=65 |issue=1 |month=March |year=1983 |pages=23–33 |doi=10.2307/3050296 |url=http://jstor.org/stable/3050296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tables games were played in Germany in the 12th century, and had reached [[Iceland]] by the 13th century. In [[Spain]], the [[Alfonso X]] manuscript ''[[Libro de los juegos]]'', completed in 1283, describes rules for a number of dice and table games in addition to its extensive discussion of chess.&lt;ref name=&quot;wollesen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wollesen |first=Jens T |title=Sub specie ludi...: Text and Images in Alfonso El Sabio's Libro de Acedrex, Dados e Tablas |journal=Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte |volume=53 |issue=3 |year=1990 |pages=277–308 |doi=10.2307/1482540 |url=http://jstor.org/stable/1482540}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th Century, tables games had spread to [[Sweden]]. A wooden board and checkers were recovered from the wreck of the [[Regalskeppet Vasa|Vasa]] among the belongings of the ship's officers. Backgammon appears widely in paintings of this period, mainly those of Dutch and German painters ([[Van Ostade]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]] and others). One surviving artwork is &quot;[[Cardsharps (Caravaggio)|Cardsharps]]&quot; by [[Caravaggio]] (the backgammon board is in the lower left). Others are the Hell of Bosch and interior of an Inn by Jan Steen.

[[Image:Hoyle-backgammon.png|thumb|''A Short Treatise on the Game of Backgammon'', by Edmond Hoyle]]

In the sixteenth century, [[Elizabethan]] laws and church regulations prohibited playing tables, but by the eighteenth century backgammon was popular among the English clergy.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray&quot;/&gt; [[Edmund Hoyle]] published ''A Short Treatise on the Game of Back-Gammon'' in 1743; this described rules and strategy for the game and was bound together with a similar text on [[whist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Allee |first=Sheila |url=http://www.utexas.edu/supportut/news_pub/yg_foreedge.html |title=A Foregone Conclusion: Fore-Edge Books Are Unique Additions to Ransom Collection |publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |accessdate=2006-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, the word &quot;backgammon&quot; is most likely derived from &quot;back&quot; and [[Middle English]] &quot;''gamen''&quot;, meaning &quot;game&quot; or &quot;play&quot;. The earliest use documented by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] was in 1650.&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=backgammon |journal=[[The Oxford English Dictionary]], Second Edition |url=http://dictionary.oed.com |year=1989 |accessdate=2006-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
Backgammon is still a very popular game in Turkey, and it is customary to name the dice rolls with their Persian number names: yek (1), dü (2), se (3), cehar (4), penc (5), şeş (6).

===United States===
The most recent major development in backgammon was the addition of the doubling cube. It was first introduced in the 1920s in [[New York City]] among members of gaming clubs in the [[Lower East Side]].&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-501&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Robertie |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Robertie |title=501 Essential Backgammon Problems |edition=Second Printing |year=2002 |page=22 |publisher=Cardoza |isbn=1-58042-019-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cube required players not only to select the best move in a given position, but also to estimate the probability of winning from that position, transforming backgammon into the [[expected value]]-driven game played in the 20th and 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertie-501&quot;/&gt;

Beginning in the mid-1960s, the popularity of Backgammon surged, in part due to the charisma of [[Prince Alexis Obolensky]], who was known as “The Father of Modern Backgammon”.&lt;ref name=GAM&gt;[http://www.gammonlife.com/news/the_inventor_of_doubling_in_backgammon.htm] GammonLife&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Obe&quot;, as he was called by friends, co-founded the International Backgammon Association&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gammonvillage.com/backgammon/news/article_display.cfm?resourceid=937&lt;/ref&gt; which published a set of official rules. He also established the World Backgammon Club of Manhattan, devised a backgammon tournament system in 1963, then organized the first major international Backgammon tournament in March, 1964 which attracted royalty, celebrities and the [[paparazzi]]. The game became a huge fad and was played on college campuses, in discothèques and at country clubs;&lt;ref name=GAM /&gt; stockbrokers and bankers began playing at conservative men's clubs.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Bernard Weintraub]] |coauthors= |title=Urge to Play Backgammon Sweeping Men's Clubs |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70A16F73A5F1A7493C1A8178AD85F428685F9&amp;scp=14&amp;sq=Tim%20Holland%20backgammon&amp;st=cse |quote=A disk and dice game that has been played in Middle Eastern streets for thousands of years, in English homes for hundreds of years, and on Bronx stoops for dozens of years has suddenly gripped the bankers and brokers of old-line men's clubs all over town. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=January 13, 1966 |accessdate=2010-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People young and old all across the country dusted off their boards and checkers. Cigarette, liquor and car companies began to sponsor tournaments and [[Hugh Hefner]] held backgammon parties at the [[Playboy Mansion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.play65.com/World-Backgammon-Championships-History.html] Play65.com, World Backgammon Championships&lt;/ref&gt; Backgammon clubs were formed and tournaments were held, resulting in a World Championship promoted in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=PLAY65 /&gt;

Most recently, the [[US Backgammon Federation]] (USBGF) was organized in 2009 to repopularize the game in the United States.  Board and committee members include many of the top players, tournament directors and writers in the worldwide backgammon community.  The USBGF has recently created a [http://usbgf.org/standards-of-ethical-practice/ Standards of Ethical Practice] to address issues tournament rules fail to touch on.

===Summary===
After Moses' death, Joshua, by virtue of his previous appointment as Moses' successor, received from God the command to cross the [[Jordan River]]. In execution of this order Joshua issues the requisite instructions to the stewards of the people for the crossing of the Jordan; and he reminds the [[Transjordan (Bible)|Transjordanian tribes]] – [[Tribe of Reuben|Reubeni]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], and the half [[tribe of Manasseh]] – of their pledge given to Moses to help their brethren.

Having reiterated the duty to follow the [[mitzvah]], Joshua orders the Israelites to set forth, and they leave [[Abila (Peraea)|Shittim]]. When they reach the [[Jordan river|Jordan River]], Joshua states that [[Ark of the covenant|the Ark]] will miraculously cross the Jordan. As soon as the Ark reaches the river, a [[miracle]] duly occurs, and the river stops flowing and rapidly dries up, so the priests carrying it halt, allowing the rest of the Israelites to cross as well. In commemoration of the event, Joshua orders two monuments to be erected: one in the riverbed; the other on the western bank, where the Israelites encamp.

The Israelites are [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcised]] at [[Gibeath-Haaraloth]] (translated as ''hill of foreskins''). Those who had been born in the desert had not been circumcised. The people are therefore circumcised, and the area is named [[Gilgal]] in memory (''Gilgal'' sounds like ''Gallothi'', ''I have removed'', but is more likely to translate as ''circle of standing stones'').

The Israelites then commence with the [[Battle of Jericho]]. Placing Jericho under siege, the Israelites circle it once a day for six days, and on the seventh make seven circuits, each time loudly blowing horns and shouting. On the final circuit, the walls cave in, and the inhabitants, except Rahab and her family, are slaughtered. A curse is pronounced against rebuilding the city.

[[Ai (Bible)|Ai]] is surveyed and pronounced weak, so the Israelite army sends only a small group to attack them. However they are defeated, causing Joshua and the people to despair. But God announces that the people have sinned: someone has stolen some of the spoils from Jericho which are meant to be for the temple. Consequently the Israelites set out to discover the sinner by [[Urim and Thummim|casting lots]], whittling them down first by tribe ([[Tribe of Judah|Judah]]), then clan (Zarhites), then sept (Zabdi), then finally detecting it as [[Achan (Bible)|Achan]]. Achan admits having taken a costly Babylonian garment, besides silver and gold, and his confession is verified by the finding of the treasure buried in his tent, so Achan is taken into the valley of [[Achor]], where he and his household are stoned and burned to death.

Afterwards, 30,000 Israelites set an ambush of Ai overnight, and in the morning another Israelite force attack and then feign retreat, drawing the forces of Ai far away from the city. When Joshua raises his lance, the 30,000 men preparing the ambush strike, while Joshua starts attacking again, thus surrounding Ai's forces. The entire city is burned and its inhabitants slaughtered. The king of Ai, however, is taken alive and delivered to Joshua. He is then impaled on a stake for public display before being buried outside the city gates, following Hebrew guidelines for the guilty (Deut. 21:23).

Joshua erects an altar on Mount Ebal and makes offerings upon it and carves into it the law of Moses. The people are arranged into two sections, with one facing [[Ebal]] and the other facing [[Gerizim]]. They each read the blessings and curses specified in [[Deuteronomy]] as appropriate.

The [[Hivites]] fool the Israelites into thinking them foreigners and gain a nonaggression treaty from the Israelites. Even after its detection, the fraud is not abrogated, though the Hivites are punished by being treated as the lowest social class (referred to via the Hebrew [[idiom]] &quot;hewers of wood and drawers of water for the altar of Yhwh&quot;).

[[Image:Dore joshua sun.jpg|left|thumb|300px|An 1883 depiction of Joshua commanding the sun to stand still in the sky.]]
[[Adonizedek]], king of [[Jerusalem]], brings about an alliance of the &quot;five kings of the Amorites&quot; (the kings of [[Hebron]], [[Jarmuth]], [[Lachish]], and [[Eglon (king)|Eglon]], and himself), and they besiege the Hivites in [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]], whom they perceive as [[treason|traitors]]. The Hivites implore Joshua's help, and so he launches a surprise attack following a night march, causing the Amorites to panic and flee as far as [[Beth-horon]]. A poem is quoted from the [[Sefer haYashar (Biblical references)|Book of Jasher]], which states that the sun stood still at Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of [[Ajalon]], in order that Joshua could complete the battle. Despite the five kings' cowardly attempt at avoiding retribution by hiding inside a cave, they are discovered and trapped there until their army has been completely obliterated. Afterwards, the kings are brought to Joshua, who first humiliates them, then orders their death and has them impaled for public display. At sunset, the bodies are thrown back into the cave from which they hid, and the entrance sealed.

[[Jabin]], king of [[Hazor (archaeological site)|Hazor]], his army, and his [[vassal]]s, rendezvous at [[Hula Valley|Merom]]. Joshua, however, executes a swift attack and is able to defeat them. Pursuing them to a great distance, he hamstrings their horses, burns their chariots, captures Hazor, slaughters its inhabitants, and burns it to the ground. Lesser royal residences are also captured and their inhabitants slaughtered, although the cities on the hill remain.

==Composition==
While the book is ascribed by tradition dating from the Babylonian Talmud (section 15a of the [[Bava Batra]], a work dating from the 3rd century CE) to Joshua, it never names its author. Most scholars in the second half of the 20th century have viewed the book as part of the series which includes [[Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]], making up the &quot;Deuteronomistic History&quot; of Israel.&lt;ref name=knoppers1&gt;Knoppers 2000, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of [[Martin Noth]], who articulated the theory in 1943, the partition of the History into books such as Joshua was a later development.&lt;ref name=knoppers1/&gt; The prevailing view in modern scholarship is that the author, or authors, of the History worked in the time of [[Josiah]] or the [[Babylonian exile]] or both.&lt;ref name=barton159&gt;Barton 2001, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Deuteronomistic hypothesis has always encountered difficulties with Joshua, and large proportions of its text are ascribed to a post-Exilic [[Priestly source|Priestly]] revision.&lt;ref name=barton159/&gt; There are also signs of a modern trend towards stressing the independent development of the books that make up the series, which allows for the preservation an ancient &quot;Joshua&quot; tradition with the book its own special (non-Deuteronomistic) themes and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Barton 2001, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre and themes==
The major themes of Joshua include:
*Worship of YHWH alone through a single central shrine (identified with the sanctuary at [[Shiloh (Biblical city)|Shiloh]]);
*Holy war (notably the insistence on total destruction of all non-Israelites as the command of YHWH) in Israelite territory;
*Holy land (the land of Canaan is the gift of YHWH, who may give it to whomever he wishes) also in Genesis;
*Exodus (Joshua mimics Exodus, the crossing of the Jordan mirroring the crossing of the Red Sea: Joshua is the fulfillment of the promise made to Israel)
*Service to YHWH (the gift of the land is permanent, however conditional on continued obedience to YHWH)&lt;ref name=barton159/&gt;

Joshua is the account of YHWH's war campaign in Canaan, validating Israel's entitlement to the land.&lt;ref&gt;Barton 2001, pp. 157–8.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also &quot;a paradigm of how [[Israel]] was to live in the land: 12 tribes, with a designated leader, united by [[covenant]] in warfare and in worship of [[YHWH]] alone at single sanctuary – all in obedience to the commands of [[Moses]] as found in [[Deuteronomy]]. The fulfillment of these commands is the principle theme of the book,&quot; weaving together what were believed to be independent fictitious [[legend]]s into a narrative that represent the unique theological stamp of the Deuteronomistic authors.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan 2009, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Deuteronomistic authors of Joshua use [[etiological]] narratives (i.e., stories explaining how things came to be) as a device to help accomplish its theological objectives. ([[Joshua]] “includes more [[etiological]] narratives than any other book of the Bible – 12 of them containing the phrase ‘to this day’).&quot;&lt;ref name=coogan163&gt;Coogan 2009, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the [[battle of Jericho]], for example, is best understood as an explanation of the ruins there and of a taboo on building on the site (i.e. because it belonged to God). Similarly, the stories of [[Rahab]] (6:25) and of the Gibeonites who trick the Israelites into sparing them are probably based on a legend that helped to explain why there were non-[[Israelite]] people living as [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]]-worshipers among the people [[Israel]] at the time of the writing of [[Joshua]], despite the supposed command of Yahweh, understood as the [[God of Israel]], for the extermination of all non-Israelites in the Promised Land.&lt;ref name=coogan164&gt;Coogan 2009, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include: how [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]] (&quot;Ruin&quot; in Hebrew) got its name; why there are 12 stones on the banks of the [[Jordan River]] at [[Gilgal]] (4:1 ff.); and how large boulders blocking caves came block the mouth of a certain cave (10:1–43).&lt;ref name=coogan163/&gt;

===Parallels between Joshua and Moses===
Joshua is the main character in the book, and his career is patterned heavily on that of Moses.&lt;ref name=coogan167&gt;Coogan 2009, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael D. Coogan specifically draws the following parallels: 
*Joshua sent spies to scout out the land near Jericho (2:1), just as Moses sent spies from the wilderness to scout out the [[Promised Land]] (Num. 13; Deut. 1:19–25).
*Joshua led the Israelites out of the wilderness into the Promised Land, crossing the Jordan River as if on dry ground (3:16), just as Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt through the Red Sea, which they crossed as if on dry land (Ex. 14:22).
*After crossing the [[Jordan River]], the Israelites celebrated the Passover (5:10–12) just as they did immediately before [[the Exodus]] (Ex. 12).
*Joshua's vision of the &quot;commander of Yahweh's army&quot; (5:13–15) is reminiscent of the divine revelation to Moses in the burning bush (Ex. 3:1–6).
*Joshua successfully intercedes on behalf of the Israelites when Yahweh is angry for their failure to fully observe the &quot;ban&quot; ([[herem]]), just as Moses frequently persuaded God not to punish the people (Ex. 32:11–14, Num. 11:2, 14:13–19).
*Joshua and the Israelites were able to defeat the people at [[Ai (Bible)]] because Joshua followed the divine instruction to extend his sword (Josh 8:18), just as the people were able to defeat the Amalekites as long as Moses extended his hand that held &quot;the staff of God&quot; (Ex. 17:8–13).
*Joshua served as the mediator of the renewed covenant between Yahweh and Israel at Shechem (8:30–35; 24), just as Moses was the mediator of Yahweh's covenant with the people at [[Mount Sinai]]/[[Mount Horeb]].
*Before his death Joshua delivered a farewell address to the Israelites (23–24), just as Moses had delivered his farewell address (Deut. 32–33).&lt;ref name=coogan167/&gt;

==Textual features==
===Etiological narratives===
The book of Joshua contains several [[etiological]] narratives that explain the origins of religious rituals, topographical features, genealogical relationships, and other aspects of ancient Israelite life. An example of such a narrative is found in 8:28, &quot;Joshua burned Ai, and made it forever a heap of ruins, as it is to this day.&quot; This narrative provides an explanation of the impressive ruins at [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]]. Another example is the story of Rahab found in 6:25, &quot;Rahab the prostitute, with her father's house and all who belonged to her, Joshua spared. She has lived in Israel to this day. For she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.&quot; Coogan argues that this text originated as a response to the question of how a Canaanite group became part of Israel, which was not customary.&lt;ref name=coogan164/&gt;

===Conquest of Canaan===
{{see also|Battle of Jericho}}
The first record of the name Israel occurs in the [[Merneptah stele]], erected for Egyptian Pharaoh [[Merneptah]] c. 1209 BCE, &quot;Israel is laid waste and his seed is not.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stager in Coogan 1998, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William G. Dever|William Dever]] sees this &quot;Israel&quot; in the central highlands as a cultural and probably political entity, well enough established to be perceived by the Egyptians as a possible challenge to their hegemony, but an ethnic group rather than an organised state.&lt;ref&gt;Dever 2003, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of villages in the highlands increased to more than 300 by the end of Iron Age I&lt;ref name=mcnutt47&gt;McNutt 1999, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; (more and larger in the north), with the settled population rising from 20,000 in the twelfth century to 40,000 in the eleventh.&lt;ref name=mcnutt70&gt;McNutt 1999, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The villagers probably shared the highlands with other communities such as pastoral nomads, but only villagers left sufficient remains to determine their settlement patterns.&lt;ref name=mcnutt69&gt;McNutt 1999, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Villages had populations of up to 300 or 400,&lt;ref name=mcnutt70/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2005, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; which lived by farming and herding and were largely self-sufficient;&lt;ref&gt;McNutt 1999, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; economic interchange was prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2005, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists and historians see more continuity than discontinuity between these highland settlements and the preceding Late Bronze Canaanite culture;&lt;ref&gt;Bright 2000, p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt; certain features such as ceramic repertoire and agrarian settlement plans have been said to be distinctives of highland sites,&lt;ref&gt;Killebrew 2005, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and collar-rimmed jars and four-roomed houses have been said to be intrinsically &quot;Israelite,&quot; but have also been said to belong to a commonly shared culture throughout Iron I Canaan.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1986, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; While some archaeologists interpret the absence of pig bones from the highland sites as an indicator of ethnicity,&lt;ref&gt;Killebrew 2005, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; this is not certain.&lt;ref name=bright473&gt;Bright 2000, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bible]] narratives are ascribed to the eras they depict by ''[[Bava Batra]]'' 14b ff. ([[Talmud]]) and early [[Church Fathers]]. Modern critic Michael Coogan sees Joshua 1–12 as a carefully constructed idealized etiological narrative rather than an objective record of history.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan 2009, pp. 163–4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2010}} Accordingly, theories of the emergence of Israel into the land of Canaan include the following. ''Gradual infiltration'' suggests Israel was a semipastoral group of nomads who settled in the hill country of Canaan, based on archaeological information and some biblical support in Judges 1. ''Peasant revolt'' adapts the infiltration model's assumptions, suggesting a peasant class revolted against the rulers of Canaan at the instigation of proto-Israelite [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]] worshipers,&lt;ref&gt;Merrill 1995, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2010}} accounting for the [[Amarna Letters]]' evidence of the [[Habiru]], but also relying on hard-to-apply Marxist economic assumptions. Many scholars are tempted to attribute widespread Late Bronze Age city destructions west of the Jordan to ''rapid conquest'' (Joshua 1–12),&lt;ref name=miller71/&gt; saying that Israel first emerged as twelve unified tribes violently sweeping through and conquering the land of Canaan.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill 1995, pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2010}} Miller and Hayes say &quot;it is not clear ... that these cities were destroyed simultaneously&quot;, or by a single enemy, or by military action; they believe that with a few exceptions (Hazor, Lachish), the cities where destructions are indicated are not the ones the Bible associates with Joshua's conquest; and they believe that those cities that are associated with the Biblical account usually have little or no sign of even being occupied or destroyed at the time.&lt;ref name=miller71&gt;Miller 1986, pp. 71–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ban===
The ban refers to the spoils of war being set apart for Yahweh worship and prohibited for any other use. The book of Joshua details how Yahweh commanded the extermination of the people of the land of Canaan, &quot;men and women, young and old&quot; (6:21) and the &quot;ban&quot; applied to these conquests. Items included in the ban were objects, animals, and human beings. The assumed point of the ban was to avoid [[apostasy]] and ensure Israel would not corrupt its worship of Yahweh with Canaanite practices. A modern theory for the ban and the extermination of the indigenous people proposes that it was a way of avoiding diseases that the Israelites would not have the immunity to withstand.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan 2009, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Two stories regarding the ban emerge in the book of Joshua. The first, in chapter two, is the story of [[Rahab]], a Canaanite prostitute, who helps two of Joshua's spies escape being caught in exchange for her life and the life of her family during the conquest. Rahab and her family are spared from the ban and become the first Canaanites within the tribe of Israel. The second occurrence is in chapter seven when Achan, a prominent Israelite, defied the ban and stole a &quot;mantle from Shinar, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels&quot;, and buried them under his tent (7:21). His transgression was revealed when the conquest at [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]] failed and Joshua inquired of Yahweh as to why.

{{Tanakh OT}}
The '''Book of Ezra''' is a book of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Originally combined with the [[Book of Nehemiah]] in a single book of [[Ezra-Nehemiah]], the two became separated in the early centuries of the Christian era.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com.au&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=IfxMeDl6BZgC&amp;dq=The+books+of+Ezra+and+Nehemiah+Fensham&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6sqOTJSYD8mecZbBvK8M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fensham, F. Charles, &quot;The books of Ezra and Nehemiah&quot; (Eerdmans, 1982)] p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Its subject is [[the Return to Zion]] following the close of the [[Babylonian captivity]], and it is divided into two parts, the first telling the story of the first return of exiles in the first year of [[Cyrus the Great]] (538 BCE) and the completion and dedication of the new [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in the sixth year of [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] (515 BCE), the second telling of the subsequent mission of [[Ezra]] to Jerusalem and his struggle to purify the Jews from the sin of marriage with non-Jews. Together with the [[Book of Nehemiah]], it represents the final chapter in the historical narrative of the [[Hebrew bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Biblical Period from Abraham to Ezra: An Historical Survey|last= Albright|first= William|authorlink= William F.

Ezra is written to fit a schematic pattern in which the God of Israel inspires a king of Persia to commission a leader from the Jewish community to carry out a mission; three successive leaders carry out three such missions, the first rebuilding the Temple, the second purifying the Jewish community, and the third sealing of the holy city itself behind a wall. (This last mission, that of [[Nehemiah]], is not part of the Book of Ezra.) The theological program of the book explains the many problems its chronological structure presents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=VI1bMiMXLs0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ezra-Nehemiah++By+Mark+A.+Throntveit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OY78crOXZ-&amp;sig=7uqxRctUrCFZlvVxstY1J1C_K0I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=x8qOTI7vLIe-cczHuZgE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Throntveit, Mark A., &quot;Ezra-Nehemiah&quot; (John Knox Press, 1992)] pp.1-3&lt;/ref&gt; It probably appeared in its earliest version around 400 BCE, and continued to be revised and edited for several centuries after before being accepted as scriptural around the time of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=m1V1DeBS6P0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Judaism,+the+first+phase:+the+place+of+Ezra+and+Nehemiah+in+the+origins&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LBwE7k7-kA&amp;sig=op-caFN9i6l1JShKPoRBIIybVsY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4kOQTOGVDY2lcaGZ-dwM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Blenkinsopp, Joseph, &quot;Judaism, the first phase&quot; (Eerdmans, 2009)] p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{Books of the Old Testament}}
''For the bible text, see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+1&amp;version=NIV Bible Gateway (opens at NIV version)]

The Book of Ezra consists of ten chapters: chapters 1-6, covering the period from the [[Decree of Cyrus]] to the dedication of the [[Second Temple]], are told in the third person; chapters 7-10, dealing with the mission of Ezra, are told largely in the first person. The book contains several documents presented as historical inclusions.

;''Chapters 1-6 (documents included in the text in italics)''
*1. ''Decree of Cyrus, first version'': [[Cyrus (Bible)|Cyrus]], inspired by God, returns the Temple vessels to [[Sheshbazzar]], &quot;prince of Judah&quot;, and directs the Israelites to return to Jerusalem with him and rebuild the Temple.
*2. 42,360 exiles, with men servants, women servants and &quot;singing men and women&quot;, return from Babylon to Jerusalem and Judah under the leadership of [[Zerubbabel]] and [[Jeshua the High Priest]].
*3. [[Jeshua the High Priest]] and Zerubbabel build the altar and celebrate the [[Feast of Tabernacles]]. In the second year the foundations of the Temple are laid and the dedication takes place with great rejoicing.
*4. ''Letter of the Samaritans to Artaxerxes, and reply of Artaxerxes'': The &quot;enemies of Judah and Benjamin&quot; offer to help with the rebuilding, but are rebuffed; they then work to frustrate the builders &quot;down to the reign of Darius.&quot; The officials of Samaria write to king Artaxerxes warning him that Jerusalem is being rebuilt, and the king orders the work to stop. &quot;Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.&quot;
*5. ''Tattenai's letter to Darius'': Through the exhortations of the prophets [[Haggai]] and [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], Zerubbabel and Joshua recommence the building of the Temple. [[Tatnai|Tattenai]], satrap over both Judah and Samaria, writes to Darius warning him that Jerusalem is being rebuilt and advising that the archives be searched to discover the decree of Cyrus.
*6. ''Decree of Cyrus, second version, and decree of Darius'': Darius finds the decree, directs Tattenai not to disturb the Jews in their work, and exempts them from tribute and supplies everything necessary for the offerings. The Temple is finished in the month of Adar in the sixth year of Darius, and the Israelites assemble to celebrate its completion.

;''Chapters 7-10''
*7. ''Letter of Artaxerxes to Ezra (Artaxerxes' rescript)'': King Artaxerxes is moved by God to commission Ezra &quot;to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God&quot; and to &quot;appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of Trans-Euphrates—all who know the laws of your God.&quot; Artaxerxes gives Ezra much gold and directs all Persian officials to aid him.
*8. Ezra gathers a large body of returnees and much gold and silver and precious vessels for the Temple and camps by a canal outside Babylon. There he discovers he has no Levites, and so sends messengers to gather some. The exiles then return to Jerusalem, where they distribute the gold and silver and offer sacrifices to God.
*9. Ezra is informed that some of the Jews already in Jerusalem have married non-Jewish women. Ezra is appalled at this proof of sin, and prays to God: &quot;O God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.&quot;
*10. Despite the opposition of some of their number, the Israelites assemble and send away their foreign wives and children.

==Historical background==

In the early 6th century Judah rebelled against Babylon and was destroyed. As a result the royal court, the priests, the prophets and scribes, were taken into captivity in Babylon. There a profound intellectual revolution took place, the exiles blaming their fate on disobedience to their God and looking forward to a future when he would allow a purified people to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple. The same period saw the rapid rise of Persia, previously an unimportant kingdom in present-day southern Iran, to a position of great power, and in 539 BCE [[Cyrus the Great]], the Persian ruler, conquered Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=IfxMeDl6BZgC&amp;dq=The+books+of+Ezra+and+Nehemiah+Fensham&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6sqOTJSYD8mecZbBvK8M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fensham, F. Charles, &quot;The books of Ezra and Nehemiah&quot; (Eerdmans, 1982)] p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to describe the parties and politics of Judah in this period because of the lack of historical source, but there seem to have been three important groups involved: the returnees from the exile who claimed the reconstruction with the support of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]; &quot;the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin&quot;; and a third group, &quot;people of the land,&quot; who seem to be local opposition against the returnees building the Temple in Jerusalem.

==Texts==
===Ezra-Nehemiah===

The oldest texts of the bible treat Ezra-plus-Nehemiah as a single book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=FOGMPDZQ-l0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ezra,+Nehemiah,+Esther+Allen+Laniak&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aem-Fh_gBo&amp;sig=VFBi6Ajd1vQKNstel3xyz9iUVAI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V8uOTNilCJO8cdbn0K4M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  Allen, L., and Laniak, T., &quot;Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther&quot; (Hendrickson, 2003)] p.4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ezra-Nehemiah]] was first divided into two separate works by the early Christian scholar [[Origen]], in the 3rd century, and the separation became entrenched in Christian bibles in the Western European tradition when this was followed by [[Jerome]] in his Latin translation.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com.au&quot;/&gt; It was not until the Middle Ages that the two became separated in Jewish bibles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=nydPyx_n1vYC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=Introduction+to+the+Old+Testament%22,+chapter+on+Ezra,+by+T.+Longman+and+R.+Dillard,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d5fj7Ku1gQ&amp;sig=yQuKHVv-aRfDGOblBMa9n1EzwLo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=n1mRTKGDGM6JcIaYjcAB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dillard, Raymond B., and Longman, Tremper, &quot;An introduction to the Old Testament&quot; (Zondervan)] p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Esdras===
[[1 Esdras]] (or Esdras α - there is also an Esdras β) - is a Greek-language text which covers much of the same material as Esdras, Nehemiah and Chronicles, but with significant differences in content and order. Some scholars, including Joseph Blenkinsopp in his 1988 commentary on Ezra-Nehemiah, holding that it is a late 2nd/early 1st century BC revision of Esdras and Esdras β,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=3PvirfZkfvQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ezra-Nehemiah:+A+Commentary++By+Joseph+Blenkinsopp&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=faKMTPPKDsSPcYLm_Y4E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Blenkinsopp, Joseph, &quot;Ezra-Nehemiah: A Commentary&quot; (Eerdmans, 1988)] pp.70-71&lt;/ref&gt; while others such as L.L. Grabbe believe it to be independent of the Hebrew-language Ezra-Nehemiah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=VK2fEzruIn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+the+Jews+and+Judaism+in+the+Second+Temple+Period,+Volume+1++Lester+L.+Grabbe&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20history%20of%20the%20Jews%20and%20Judaism%20in%20the%20Second%20Temple%20Period%2C%20Volume%201%20%20Lester%20L.%20Grabbe&amp;f=false Grabbe, L.L., &quot;A history of the Jews and Judaism in the Second Temple Period, Volume 1&quot; (T&amp;T Clark, 2004)] p.83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure, composition and date==
===Structure===
The contents of Ezra-Nehemiah are structured in theological, rather than chronological, order: &quot;The Temple must come first, then the purifying of the community, then the building of the outer walls of the city, and so finally all could reach a grand climax in the reading of the law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Coggins, &quot;The books of Ezra and Nehemiah&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 1976)p.107, quoted in [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=VI1bMiMXLs0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ezra-Nehemiah++By+Mark+A.+Throntveit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OY78crOXZ-&amp;sig=7uqxRctUrCFZlvVxstY1J1C_K0I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=x8qOTI7vLIe-cczHuZgE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Throntveit, Mark A., &quot;Ezra-Nehemiah&quot; (John Knox Press, 1992)] p.3&lt;/ref&gt;
The &quot;plot&quot; follows a repeating pattern in which the God of Israel &quot;stirs up&quot; the king of Persia to commission a Jewish leader (Zerubbabel, Ezra, Nehemiah) to undertake a mission; the leader completes his mission in the face of opposition; and success is marked by a great assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=VI1bMiMXLs0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ezra-Nehemiah++By+Mark+A.+Throntveit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OY78crOXZ-&amp;sig=7uqxRctUrCFZlvVxstY1J1C_K0I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=x8qOTI7vLIe-cczHuZgE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Throntveit, Mark A., &quot;Ezra-Nehemiah&quot; (John Knox Press, 1992)] pp.2-4&lt;/ref&gt; The tasks of the three leaders are progressive: first the Temple is restored (Zerubabbel), then the community of Israel (Ezra), and finally the walls which will separate the purified community and Temple from the outside world (Nehemiah).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=VI1bMiMXLs0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ezra-Nehemiah++By+Mark+A.+Throntveit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OY78crOXZ-&amp;sig=7uqxRctUrCFZlvVxstY1J1C_K0I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=x8qOTI7vLIe-cczHuZgE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Throntveit, Mark A., &quot;Ezra-Nehemiah&quot; (John Knox Press, 1992)] p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern is completed with a final coda in which Nehemiah restores the cult of Yahweh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=VI1bMiMXLs0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ezra-Nehemiah++By+Mark+A.+Throntveit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OY78crOXZ-&amp;sig=7uqxRctUrCFZlvVxstY1J1C_K0I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=x8qOTI7vLIe-cczHuZgE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Throntveit, Mark A., &quot;Ezra-Nehemiah&quot; (John Knox Press, 1992)] p.2&lt;/ref&gt; This concern with a schematic pattern-making, rather than with history in the modern sense of a factual account of events in the order in which they occurred, explains the origin of the many problems which surround both Ezra and Nehemiah as historical sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=VI1bMiMXLs0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ezra-Nehemiah++By+Mark+A.+Throntveit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OY78crOXZ-&amp;sig=7uqxRctUrCFZlvVxstY1J1C_K0I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=x8qOTI7vLIe-cczHuZgE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Throntveit, Mark A., &quot;Ezra-Nehemiah&quot; (John Knox Press, 1992)] pp1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition===

In the 20th century views on the composition of Ezra revolved around the competing views that either it was written by Ezra himself, who may also have been the author of the [[Books of Chronicles]], or alternatively, that the author of Chronicles was also the author of Ezra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=IfxMeDl6BZgC&amp;dq=The+books+of+Ezra+and+Nehemiah+Fensham&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6sqOTJSYD8mecZbBvK8M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fensham, F. Charles, &quot;The books of Ezra and Nehemiah&quot; (Eerdmans, 1982)] pp.1-2 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently it has been increasingly recognised that Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles all have extremely complex histories stretching over many stages of editing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=xRS8P0RDXeoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ezra+the+scribe:+the+development+of+Ezra+7-10+and+Nehemiah+8&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nskI6byf4g&amp;sig=RCaWZmZlbDVhhhQBYeLmAbGKMiw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PMuOTIb6N4TJcay3-b0E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pakkala, Juha, &quot;Ezra the scribe: the development of Ezra 7-10 and Nehemiah 8&quot; (Walter de Gryter, 2004)] p.16&lt;/ref&gt; and most scholars now are cautious of assuming a unified composition with a single theology and point of view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=VK2fEzruIn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+the+Jews+and+Judaism+in+the+Second+Temple+Period,+Volume+1++Lester+L.+Grabbe&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20history%20of%20the%20Jews%20and%20Judaism%20in%20the%20Second%20Temple%20Period%2C%20Volume%201%20%20Lester%20L.%20Grabbe&amp;f=false Grabbe, L.L., &quot;A history of the Jews and Judaism in the Second Temple Period, Volume 1&quot; (T&amp;T Clark, 2004)] p.71&lt;/ref&gt; As an indication of the many layers of editing which Ezra has undergone, one recent study finds that Ezra 1-6 and Ezra 9-10 were originally separate documents, that they were spliced together at a later stage by the authors of Ezra 7-6, and that all have undergone extensive later editing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=xRS8P0RDXeoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ezra+the+scribe:+the+development+of+Ezra+7-10+and+Nehemiah+8&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nskI6byf4g&amp;sig=RCaWZmZlbDVhhhQBYeLmAbGKMiw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PMuOTIb6N4TJcay3-b0E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pakkala, Juha, &quot;Ezra the scribe: the development of Ezra 7-10 and Nehemiah 8&quot; (Walter de Gryter, 2004), pp.132, 135, and p.302, Appendix C: reconstructed text of Ezra 7-10]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Date===

There is general recognition that the editing of Ezra continued well into the [[Hellenistic era]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=m1V1DeBS6P0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Judaism,+the+first+phase:+the+place+of+Ezra+and+Nehemiah+in+the+origins&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LBwE7k7-kA&amp;sig=op-caFN9i6l1JShKPoRBIIybVsY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4kOQTOGVDY2lcaGZ-dwM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Blenkinsopp, Joseph, &quot;Judaism, the first phase&quot; (Eerdmans, 2009)] p.87&lt;/ref&gt; The question of when the core of the book originated depends in the first place on the dates assigned to Ezra himself (assuming him to have been a historic person). The only clue to go by is the note in Ezra 7:7-8 that he arrived in Jerusalem in &quot;the seventh year of Artaxerxes.&quot; Unfortunately there were three kings of this name and the text doesn't specify which one. The traditional date, and currently the most popular candidate, is 458 BCE, based on the assumption that the king is Artaxerxes I. A date of 398 BCE, based on the possibility that the king might be Artaxerxes II, was once popular but has been seriously challenged in recent scholarship. A date of 428 BCE, based on the idea that the &quot;seventh&quot; year of Artaxerxes is a mistake for &quot;thirty-seventh&quot; year, has become less popular, as it is based entirely on conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=RcB9XepTzRMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Levitical+authorship+of+Ezra-Nehemiah&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tdbHiV4lsf&amp;sig=heOovXSmQhX0whh0Ap9fUKNPHkY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Dk6QTJWALMOpcev_sfoM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Min, Kyung-Jin, &quot;The Levitical authorship of Ezra-Nehemiah&quot; (T&amp;T Clark, 2004)] p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persian documents==
Seven purported Persian decrees of kings or letters to and from high officials are quoted in Ezra. Their authenticity has been contentious, some scholars accepting at least some of them as genuine, others rejecting them, either in whole or in part. L.L. Grabbe surveys six tests against which the documents can be measured (comparative known Persian material, linguistic details, contents, presence of Jewish theology, the Persian attitude to local religions, and Persian letter-writing formulas) and concludes that all the documents are late post-Persian works and probable forgeries, but that some features suggest a genuine Persian correspondence behind some of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=VK2fEzruIn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+the+Jews+and+Judaism+in+the+Second+Temple+Period,+Volume+1++Lester+L.+Grabbe&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20history%20of%20the%20Jews%20and%20Judaism%20in%20the%20Second%20Temple%20Period%2C%20Volume%201%20%20Lester%20L.%20Grabbe&amp;f=false Grabbe, L.L., &quot;A history of the Jews and Judaism in the Second Temple Period, Volume 1&quot; (T&amp;T Clark, 2004)] p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tanakh OT}}
The '''Book of Daniel''' (Hebrew: דניאל) is a book in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. In the Jewish canon, the book of Daniel is included with the [[Ketuvim|Writings]] not in the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]]. The book tells of how [[Daniel]], a [[Judean]] exile at the court of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] (605 to 562 BC), the ruler of [[Babylon]], becomes a high government official&lt;ref&gt;Daniel 2:48, Mesoretic text. In Jewish tradition [[Daniel in rabbinic literature|Daniel]] is not counted in the list of [[prophets]].&lt;/ref&gt; and delivers various visions. 

The traditionalist view dates Daniel to the 6th century. However, in the critical view, &quot;there would be few modern biblical scholars ... who would now seriously defend such an opinion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The New Jerome Biblical Commentary&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

The earliest [[Biblical manuscript|manuscripts]] discovered, like the traditional Jewish version, are written partly in Hebrew and partly in Aramaic,&lt;ref&gt;[[Geza Vermes|Vermes, Geza]], ''The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English'', London: Penguin, 1998. ISBN 0-14-024501-4&lt;/ref&gt; and consist of a series of six third-person narratives (chapters one to six) followed by four [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] visions in the first person (chapters seven to twelve). The narratives take the form of court tales which focus on tests of religious [[fidelity]] involving Daniel and his friends (chapters one, three and six), and Daniel's interpretation of royal dreams and visions (chapters two, four and five). In the second part of the book, Daniel recounts his own reception of dreams, visions and angelic interpretations.

==Structure and contents==
===The Court Tales===

The first six chapters comprise a series of court tales involving Daniel and his three companions. The first account is in Hebrew; then Aramaic is used from ch. 2:4, beginning with the speech of the &quot;[[Chaldea]]ns&quot;, through chapter seven. Hebrew is then used from chapter eight through chapter twelve. Three additional sections are preserved only in the [[Septuagint]], and are considered [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]]l by Protestant Christians and Jews, and [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] by Catholic and Orthodox Christians.

====Daniel in the service of the king====
After being taken [[Babylonian captivity|captive to Babylon]], Daniel and his three friends ([[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]]) keep the law and enter the king's service. In matters of wisdom, literature, and learning they are judged &quot;ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in the kingdom&quot;. Daniel, moreover, has a unique talent for interpreting dreams and visions.

====The Great Image====
{{Main|Daniel 2}}
The king has a disturbing dream and asks his wise men to interpret it, but refuses to divulge its content. When they protest he sentences all of them, including Daniel and his friends, to death. Daniel intervenes and asks for a temporary stay of execution so that he can petition his God for a solution. He receives an explanatory vision in the night, and then relays the content and meaning of the king's dream the following day. [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] has dreamed of an enormous idol made of four metals, with feet of mixed iron and clay.  The image is completely destroyed by a rock that turns into a huge mountain, filling the whole earth. The idol's composition of metals is interpreted as a [[Nebuchadnezzar's statue vision in Daniel 2|series of successive kingdoms]], starting with Nebuchadnezzar. Finally all of these dominions are crushed by God's kingdom, a kingdom that will &quot;endure forever&quot;.

====The fiery furnace====
{{Main|Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego}}
Daniel's companions Ananias (Hananiah/Shadrach), Azariah (Abednego), and Mishael (Meshach) refuse to bow to the emperor's golden statue and are thrown into a furnace. As seen by Nebuchadnezzar, a fourth figure appears in the furnace with the three and God is credited for preserving them from the flames.

====The madness of Nebuchadnezzar====
[[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] recounts a dream of a huge tree which is suddenly cut down at the command of a heavenly messenger. Daniel is summoned and interprets the dream as referring to Nebuchadnezzar, who for seven years will lose his power and mind and become like a wild animal. All of this comes to pass until, at the end of the seven years, Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges that &quot;heaven rules&quot; and his kingdom and sanity are restored. The recurring image of a tree representing a kingdom appears at least three times in the Bible.

====Belshazzar's feast====
[[Belshazzar]] and his nobles blasphemously drink from sacred Jewish temple vessels, offering praise to inanimate gods, until a hand mysteriously appears before the crowd and [[The writing on the wall|writes upon the wall]] of the palace. The horrified king eventually summons Daniel who is able to read the writing and offer the following interpretation: ''Mene, Mene'' - God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end. ''Tekel'' - You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting. ''Upharsin'' - Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians. &quot;That very night&quot;, we are informed, Belshazzar was slain and &quot;Darius the Mede&quot; took over the kingdom.

====Daniel in the lions' den====
Daniel is elevated to a pre-eminent position under Darius which elicits the jealousy of other officials. Knowing of Daniel's devotion to his God, these officials trick the king into issuing an edict forbidding worship of any other god or man for a 30 day period. Because Daniel continues to pray three times a day to God towards Jerusalem, he is accused and king Darius, forced by his own decree, throws Daniel into the lions' den. God shuts up the mouths of the lions and the next morning king Darius finds Daniel unharmed and casts his accusers and their families into the lions' pit where they are instantly devoured.

===Apocalyptic visions ===
{{Eschatology}}
The four visions of chapters seven to twelve consist of four visions focusing on a [[Armilus|fearsome future king]] who attacks the &quot;saints&quot;, and the city and temple of Jerusalem; in contrast to the earlier chapters, they are introduced in the first person. One feature of this section is Daniel's reliance on heavenly figures to interpret and explain his visions. The historical setting of the first chapters does not appear, except in the form of regnal dates. Chapter seven is written in Aramaic while chapters eight to twelve are in Hebrew. This section of Daniel contains the first references to the &quot;kingdom of God&quot; in Jewish scripture, and the first overt reference to the resurrection of the dead.

====Vision of the great beasts====
{{Main|Daniel 7}}
The vision in the first year of [[Belshazzar]] the king of [[Babylon]] (7:1) concerning four great beasts (7:3) representing four future kings (7:17) or kingdoms (7:23), the fourth of which devours the whole earth, treading it down and crushing it (7:23). This fourth beast has ten horns representing ten kings. They are followed by a further wicked king, or &quot;little horn&quot;, who subdues three of the ten (7:24), speaks against the Most High, wages war against the saints, and attempts to change the set times and laws (7:25); after '[[Time, times, and half a time|a time and times and half a time]]', this king is judged and stripped of his kingdom by an &quot;Ancient of Days&quot; and his heavenly court (7:26); next, &quot;one like a son of man&quot; approaches the Ancient of Days and is invested with worldwide dominion; moreover, his everlasting reign over all kings and kingdoms is shared with &quot;the people of the Most High&quot; (7:27)

====Vision of the ram and goat====
{{Main|Daniel 8}}
The vision in the third year of Belshazzar concerning a [[Domestic sheep|ram]] and a male [[goat]] (8:1-27) which, we are informed, represent Medea, Persia (the ram's two horns), and Greece (the goat). The goat with a mighty horn becomes very powerful until the horn breaks off to be replaced by four &quot;lesser&quot; horns. The vision focuses on a wicked king who arises to challenge the &quot;army of the Lord&quot; by removing the daily temple sacrifice and desecrating the sanctuary for a period of &quot;twenty three hundred evening/mornings&quot;.

====Prophecy of the Seventy Septets====

{{Main|Prophecy of Seventy Weeks}}
The vision in first year of [[Darius I|Darius]] the son of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Ahasuerus]] (9:1) concerning [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks|seventy weeks]], or seventy &quot;sevens&quot;, apportioned for the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|history of the Israelites]] and of [[Jerusalem]] (9:24) This consists of a meditation on the prediction in Jeremiah that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years, a lengthy prayer by Daniel in which he pleads for God to restore Jerusalem and its temple, and an angelic explanation which focuses on a longer time period - &quot;seventy sevens&quot; - and a future restoration and destruction of city and temple by a coming ruler.

====Vision of the kings of north and south====
{{Main|Daniel 11}}
Daniel has a lengthy vision (10:1 - 12:13) in the third year of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] king of [[History of Persia|Persia]], regarding conflicts between the &quot;King of the North&quot; and the &quot;King of the South&quot; (= Egypt, 11:8). Starting with references to Persia and Greece it, again, culminates in the description of an arrogant king who desecrates the temple, sets up a &quot;desolating abomination&quot;, removes the daily sacrifice, and persecutes those who remain true to the &quot;holy covenant&quot;. The northern kingdom is likely that of the Seleucids, which climaxed in Antiochus IV &quot;Epiphanes&quot; persecuting Jews in Judea and placing an idol in the Temple in Jerusalem.

The visions of Daniel, with those of 1 Enoch, Isaiah, Jubilees, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, are the  inspiration for much of the apocalyptic ideology and symbolism of the [[Qumran]] community's [[Dead Sea scrolls]] and the early literature of Christianity.  &quot;Daniel's clear association with the Maccabean Uprising and those against Rome are a possible factor in the eventual downgrading of it, to include a redefinition of the role of prophet, keeping in mind that at roughly this time the Hebrew canon was being evaluated and adopted.&quot; (Eisenman 1997, p 19f).

==Textual witnesses==
The [[Septuagint]] translations of Daniel include material not found in the Hebrew [[Masoretic text]] version: the [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]] in chapter 3, and the stories of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susannah and the Elders]] and [[Bel and the Dragon]]; there is little doubt that these were added after the completion of the Hebrew/Aramaic book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=9r_Zs7T1nCMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Daniel:+with+an+introduction+to+apocalyptic+literature&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-KqrJ7cA7M&amp;sig=F7xiF-XLbr_NR25iastKnVE70PY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tSqwTPjFD8eecLmY2fYK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Collins, John Joseph, &quot;Daniel: with an introduction to apocalyptic literature&quot; (Eerdmans. 1984)] p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of eight copies of the book of Daniel have been found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls.&lt;ref name=&quot;eschatology_messianism_and_the_dead_sea_scrolls&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Evans | first1 = Craig A. | last2 = Flint | first2 = Peter W. | title = Eschatology, messianism, and the Dead Sea scrolls | url = http://books.google.com/?id=DDUw9mvbq4AC&amp;pg=PA44 | year = 1997 | publisher = W.B.

Myers, Astrid B. Beck]&lt;/ref&gt; Both Greek versions contain the [[Additions to Daniel|apocryphal chapters]] (c. 100 BC) not found in the Hebrew/Aramaic text of Daniel. Theodotion's translaton is much closer to the Hebrew/Aramaic Daniel of the Masoretic Hebrew Bible, and became so popular that it replaced the original Septuagint version of Daniel in all but two manuscripts of the Septuagint itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=L6zJG-9BZMQC&amp;pg=PA119 Invitation to the Apocrypha By Daniel J.

Wilson]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eerdmans commentary on the Bible By James D. G. Dunn, John William Rogerson&lt;/ref&gt;  For its part, the older (pre-Theodotion) Septuagint edition sometimes agrees more with the older Hebrew / Aramaic readings of the text of the Qumran fragments, against the more recent Theodotion / Masoretic version reflected in modern translations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Literary structure==
[[File:Daniel double chiasm.jpg|right|300px]]
{{See also|Prophecy_of_Seventy_Weeks#Literary_structure}}
[[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] William H. Shea Ph.D. (Archeology).&lt;ref name=&quot;Shea&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shea|1986|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the book of Daniel was composed as a double [[chiastic structure|chiasm]]. Chiastic or concentric structure is a common feature of ancient Hebrew poetry and literature. A qualification, however, is appropriate: while the chiastic structure of chapters 2 - 7, originally identified by A. Lenglet in 1972, is widely accepted by scholars, Shea's proposal for a similar structure in chapters 8 - 12 is not.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===Related themes have common label===
Related sections have a common label.  For instance those labeled '''A, A', A&quot;''' and '''A&quot;'''' are placed in parallel because they all have a similar theme: prophecies about successive kingdoms.
God's people suffer trials in the parts labelled '''B, B', B&quot;''' and '''B&quot;'''', although the suggested parallels in chapters 9 and 10 seem to have little in common with 3 and 6. The decision of kings to choose Daniel's God or not are the themes in '''C, C', C&quot;''' and '''C&quot;'''', provided we can agree with Shea that two individual verses in chapter 9 are the structural counterparts of chapters 4 and 5.  The trial faced by the Messiah is portrayed in the focal point of the book ('''D''' ) by Shea.

===Language emphasizes structure===
To emphasize the importance of the chiastic structure, the first chiasm was written in Aramaic and the second in Hebrew.   The literary structure explains why Aramaic continues to be used in chapter 7 rather than ending in chapter 6 at, seemingly, the end of the first half of the book.

===Structure has precedence over chronology===
The literary structure of the book takes precedence over chronology.  The first 6 narrative chapters are fit into the structure rather than defining it.  For instance, chapter 6 ( '''B'''' ), which ought to follow chapter 7 ( '''A'''' ) chronologically, is put in parallel with chapter 3 ( '''B''' ) because they both deal with the persecution of Daniel and his friends.  And chapter 5 ( '''C'''' ) should follow chapters 7 and 8 ( '''A&quot;''' ).  Instead, it is put in parallel with chapter 4 ( '''C''' ). In both divine judgements are pronounced against arrogant Babylonian kings.

===Grouping Emphasizes Prophecies===
This chiastic grouping of chapters having the same theme has important implications when it comes to the chapters containing prophecies ( '''A, A', A&quot;, A'&quot;''' ).   Not only are they parallel because they contain prophecies, but the prophecies themselves are parallel to each other. This parallelism between the prophecies [[Daniel Prophecy Literary Parallels#The Visions Considered Parallel by Christian's of all Ages|has been recognized for millennia.]] This does not mean, however, that Christian commentators have identified the same kingdoms in each chapter. While chapters 2 and 7 have generally - though not exclusively&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casey|1980|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; - been interpreted as extending to Roman times, chapter 8, for example, has traditionally been applied to the time of Antiochus Epiphanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|1978|p=}} Ford speaks of 'the almost universal application of [the little horn symbol of chapter 8] to Antiochus Epiphanes'. He also quotes the pre-critical and post-counter reformation view of the Anglican Bishop Thomas Newton in his &quot;Dissertation on the Prophecies...&quot; originally published in the mid 1700s (JF Dove,1838, p247): 'This little horn [of Daniel 8] is by the generality  of interpreters, both Jewish and Christian, ancient and modern, supposed to mean Antiochus Epiphanes.' Newton adds that 'most of the ancient fathers and modern divines and commentators' agree with Jerome in identifying Antiochus in chapter 8, while also allowing that &quot;Antiochus Epiphanes was a type of Antichrist&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
{{POV-section|date=January 2010}}
A major critic of Daniel, H. H. Rowley, considered [[Daniel 11|chapter 11]] as &quot;a first-class historical source for that period&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rowley|1950|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another scholar ranked the fifth chapter of Daniel &quot;just below the cuneiform literature&quot;, for accuracy as far as outstanding events are concerned, for non-Babylonian records on the close of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dougherty|1929|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even allowing for such possible exceptions, most of the content of the narrative is unhistorical.
The six objections given below represent, in order of significance, some of the major anachronisms.

===Darius the Mede===

Some historians criticize the notion of a separate [[Medes|Mede]] rule by pointing out that the Persians at that point in history had control over the [[Medes]], and that the contemporary cuneiform documents, such as the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] and the [[Babylonian Chronicle]], leave no room for any Mede occupation of Babylon before the Persians under Cyrus conquered it. It has been suggested&lt;ref name=&quot;heuvel&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|van den Heuvel|1998|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the author's apparent confusion on this issue could be due to his reliance on [[Jeremiah]] (see Dan. 9:2): and Jeremiah prophesied (in Jeremiah 51:11), at the height of the Median empire's power, that Babylon would fall to the Medes.

The personage whom ''Daniel'' describes as taking control of Babylon after Belshazzar is deposed is named as ''Darius the Mede,'' who rules over Babylon in chapters 6 and 9. ''Daniel'' reports that Darius was 'about 62 years old' when he was 'made king over Babylon.' Darius the Mede, while mentioned in the book of Daniel, the works of [[Flavius Josephus]], and Jewish [[midrashic|Midrash]] material, is not known from any primary historical sources. Neither the Babylonian nor the Persian histories record such a person. [[Herodotus]], who wrote his history about 440 BC, records that Babylon fell to the Persian army, under the control of King Cyrus, who had conquered the [[Median Empire]] as early as 550 BC.

As Darius the Mede is unknown to any other source, many historians view his presence in ''Daniel'' as simply a mistake of a much later author, who has perhaps inadvertently placed the Persian King [[Darius I]] at an earlier date than he actually reigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1994|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three key pieces of information seem to support this. Firstly, Darius I, like Cyrus, also conquered Babylon and personally commanded the Persian army that took the city in 522 BC to put down a rebellion. Secondly, Daniel's reference to Darius organising the empire by appointing satraps and administrators fits Darius I perfectly: he is known to history as the Persian king par excellence who professionalised the empire's bureaucracy and organised it into satrapies and tax districts. Thirdly, Darius I was an important figure in Jewish history, remembered as a king associated with Cyrus who permitted the returned exiles to rebuild the temple (see Ezra chs 1-6).

In Daniel 9:1, Darius is said to be the son of [[Ahasuerus]], commonly acknowledged to be a variant spelling of Xerxes (Esther 1:1). [[Darius I]] was the father of a king called Xerxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;heuvel&quot; /&gt;

====Responses to the problem of Darius the Mede====

As no ruler of this name is recorded, scholars have attempted to identify him with other figures:

;&quot;Darius the Mede&quot; as Cyrus the Great
This theory was first proposed by [[Donald Wiseman]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Unlike Gubaru or Astyages, [[Cyrus the Great]] of Persia was the king who took over the Babylonian Empire.  Cyrus was also married to a Mede, and had a Median mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen R. Miller 1994 p. 149&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, his maternal grandfather [[Astyages]], to whom he owed fealty, was the so-called &quot;Last King of the Median Empire.&quot; An analysis of variant early texts, particularly the Septuagint, reveals that the names &quot;Darius&quot; (דריוש DRYWS in Hebrew) and &quot;Cyrus&quot; (כורש KWRS) are reversed in 11:1, and may have been miscopied elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The appellation &quot;Mede&quot; (Heb. מדי MDY) may have been used as an ethnic term to apply to Persians as well, who were of the same race.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., as stated in [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]]' ''Diamerismos'', §204, among other places.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Dan. 6:28, &quot;So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian&quot;, could also be translated, &quot;So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius, that is, the reign of Cyrus the Persian.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colless&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Colless|1992|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, kings commonly took dual titles and Nabonidus, Cyrus' cousin, referred to Cyrus as &quot;the king of the Medes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen R. Miller 1994 p. 149&quot;/&gt;

;&quot;Darius the Mede&quot; as Gubaru/Ugbaru
[[Gubaru]] was the governor of Gutium, who actually led Cyrus's army that captured Babylon in the month of Tashritu in the 17th year (see Pierre Briant below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later Cyrus made his triumphal entry into Babylon and a week after that Gubaru died. It is possible that Cyrus may have rewarded Gubaru with a regional governorship for capturing the capital of the Babylonian Empire and ending the war.  Furthermore, under the first translation of Dan. 6:28, Darius ruled during the reign of Cyrus, and Dan. 5:31 states that Darius the Mede &quot;''received'' the kingdom&quot; of the Chaldeans.  Complicating this view is the question of whether or not Gubaru and Ugbaru are two different people, or simply variant spellings of the same name.

Verse 1 of &quot;[[Bel and the Dragon]]&quot; mentions [[Astyages]] the Mede, who was indeed the last king before Cyrus; but nearly the same verse is added in the Greek [[LXX]] after the end of chapter 6 of Daniel, but with &quot;Darius&quot; in place of &quot;Astyages&quot;. ( LXX Dan. 14:1 and Dan 6:29)

;&quot;Darius the Mede&quot; as king of the Medes
Talmudic and midrashic sources describe Darius the Mede as the uncle and father-in-law of Cyrus the Great, to whom Cyrus owed fealty.  After Darius's death, Cyrus took the throne. According to [[Josippon]], the Ahasuerus in the book of [[Esther]] was the son of Darius the Mede. The Midrash Tanchuma describes the fall of Babylon as described in Daniel and adds to the narrative Darius taking Vashti, the daughter of Belshazzar, as a wife for his son Ahasuerus.

;&quot;Darius the Mede&quot; as [[Cyaxares II]]
The little we know of Cyaxares from extra-Biblical sources matches the description offered in the Book of Daniel. According to Daniel, he began ruling when he was 62 years old (chapter 5, verse 31), appointed 120 satraps to govern over their provinces or districts (chapter 6, verse 1), was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans (chapter 9, verse 1), and pre-dated Cyrus (chapter 11, verse 1).

===Belshazzar===
For many years [[Belshazzar]] (Akk. bêl-šar-usur), was an enigma for historians. The book of Daniel states that he was &quot;king&quot; (Ar. מֶלֶך) the night that Babylon fell (chap. 5) and says that his &quot;father&quot; (Ar. אַב) was Nebuchadnezzar (5:2, 11, 13, 18). Prior to 1854, archeologists and historians knew nothing of Belshazzar outside the book of Daniel. Indeed, while the deuterocanonical [[Book of Baruch]] (Baruch 1:11, 12) and the writings of Josephus (Antiquities 10.11.2-4 §231-247) do mention Belshazzar, the references to Belshazzar in these works are ultimately dependent on the book of Daniel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1994|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Xenophon]] (Cyropaedia, 7.5.28-30&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Xenophon||}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Herodotus (The Histories, 1.191) recount the fall of Babylon to Cyrus the Great, yet neither of these writers give the name of the king of Babylon. Additionally, both Berossus’ and Ptolemy's king lists have [[Nabonidus]] (Akk. ''Nabû-nā'id'') as the last king of Babylon with no mention of Belshazzar.

From that time new evidence from Babylon has verified the existence of Belshazzar as well as his co-regency during the absence of his father, [[Nabonidus]], in Temâ. For example, In the [[Cylinder of Nabonidus|Nabonidus Cylinder]], Nabonidus petitions the god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] as follows: &quot;And as for Belshazzar my firstborn son, my own child, let the fear of your great divinity be in his heart, and may he commit no sin; may he enjoy happiness in life&quot;. In addition, The Verse Account of Nabonidus (British Museum tablet 38299) states, &quot;[Nabonidus] entrusted the army (?) to his oldest son, his first born, the troops in the country he ordered under his command. He let everything go, ''entrusted the kingship'' (Akk. ''šarrûtu'') to him, and, himself, he started out for a long journey. The military forces of Akkad marching with him, he turned to Temâ deep in the west&quot; (Col. II, lines 18 - 29. 18). In line with the statement that Nabonidus &quot;entrusted the kingship&quot; to Belshazzar in his absence, there is evidence that Belshazzar's name was used with his father's in oath formulas, that he was able to pass edicts, lease farmlands, and receive the &quot;royal privilege&quot; to eat the food offered to the gods.

The available information concerning Belshazzar's regency goes silent after Nabonidus' fourteenth year. According to the Nabonidus Chronicle, Nabonidus was back from Temâ by his seventeenth year and celebrated the New Year's Festival (Akk. ''[[Assyrian new year|Akitu]]''). Whether or not Belshazzar continued his regency under his father's authority after his return cannot be demonstrated from the available documents. Some scholars have argued that the non-observance of the ''Akitu'' during Nabonidus' absence demonstrates that Belshazzar was not the &quot;king&quot; since it shows that he could not officiate over the festival. However, The Verse Account of Nabonidus says, &quot;Nabonidus said: 'I shall build a temple for him (the Moon god Sin)...till I have achieved this, till I have obtained what is my desire, I shall omit all festivals, I shall order even the New Year's festival to cease!'&quot; Thus, the halting of the ''Akitu'' may have been done by the king's command rather an inability on the part of Belshazzar.  This stated, the fact that Belshazzar did not disobey his father's command is evidence that Nabonidus remained the official (and actual) king of Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: K-P, By Geoffrey W. Bromiley, see &quot;Nebonidus,&quot; pp 468-470&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nabonidus cylinder sippar bm1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Nabonidus Cylinder]]]]
There is no evidence that Belshazzar ever officially held the title of &quot;king&quot; as he is never called such in the [[Cylinder of Nabonidus|Nabonidus Cylinder]]. Furthermore, the Aramaic term מלך (''mlk'', king) applied in Daniel could be used to translate titles of various levels of high ranking officials. (This can be seen in the case of a 9th century BC Akkadian/Aramaic bilingual inscription found at Tel Fekheriyeh in 1979 which reads &quot;king&quot; for the Akkadian &quot;governor&quot;.)  A contract tablet dating to the third year of his regency (550 BC) includes the designation &quot;son of the king.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lenci|2008|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This, of course, is not proof that he possessed any status as the official king of Babylon.  The bottom line is that Nabonidus was still alive when Cyrus conquered Babylon, and had not been replaced as the official king of Babylon by Belshazzar.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

No known extrabiblical text indicates a blood relation between Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar. Historians have objected to this aspect of the record in Daniel. There were several rulers over Babylon between the death of Nebuchadnezzar and the rulership of Nabonidus and Belshazzar. Some{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} have attributed the lack of mention of these rulers as indicating the author mistakenly thought that the two rulerships were consecutive. The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', holding to a later date of the book (see 'Date'), supposed that &quot;during the long period of oral tradition the unimportant kings of Babylon might easily have been forgotten, and the last king, who was vanquished by Cyrus, would have been taken as the successor of the well-known Nebuchadnezzar.&quot; Based on this reasoning, some historians have considered the reference to Belshazzar's relationship to Nebuchadnezzar simply an error based on the above misconception.

However, there is another explanation.  Belshazzar is never called an independent king in the book of Daniel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hasel|1977|p=168, note 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, in Daniel 5:7, 16, 29 Belshazzar implies that he is the second ruler in the kingdom, not the sole ruler; and yet, he has sufficient power to make someone the third ruler in the kingdom.  Secondly, co-regencies were not that uncommon in the Ancient Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1917|pp=107–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shea|1982|pp=148–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, Wilson, in the previous reference, showed that the very word &quot;king&quot; was used in a variety of ways other than that which we use today. The same also applies to the use of the word &quot;son&quot;--it doesn't necessarily mean a biological relationship and can carry the meaning &quot;successor.&quot; For example, the 9th century Assyrian [[Black Obelisk]] lists [[Jehu]] as the &quot;son of [[Omri]]&quot; even though [[Jehu]] was from a different lineage and did not take the crown directly after [[Omri]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen R. Miller 1994 p. 149&quot;/&gt;  Finally, Daniel is not writing an official state document for Babylon such as one would expect from the court scribes, although the lack of accurate specificity in the references also tends to be inconsistent with the claim of an early date for Daniel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Millard|1977|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2009|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Madness of Nebuchadnezzar ===
There are also historical objections to the account of the [[insanity]] suffered by [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] found in the fourth chapter of Daniel. Three Aramaic [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] fragments known as ''The Prayer of Nabonidus'' (4QPrNab, sometimes given as 4QOrNab) seem to contain a number of parallels with Daniel chapter four: a Babylonian king (spelled ''N-b-n-y'') is afflicted by God with an &quot;evil disease&quot; for a period of seven years; he is cured and his sins forgiven after the intervention of a Jewish exile who is described as a &quot;diviner&quot;; he issues a written proclamation in praise of the Most High God, and speaks in the first person. These tiny fragments turned up in a collection of Dead Sea Scrolls possessed by the Jordanian Government, and were first published by Milik in 1956. Long before this, scholars had speculated that Nabonidus' exile in Teima lay behind the story of Nebuchadnezzar's banishment and madness in Daniel chapter four.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of differences between ''The Prayer of Nabonidus'' and the account of Nebuchadnezzar's madness:

# Different kings are involved in the two accounts
# Nebuchadnezzar's &quot;affliction&quot; was of the mind whereas Nabonidus' seems to have been a skin disease.
# According to one possible translation, the exorcist or diviner heals Nabonidus and pardons his sins, whereas in Daniel Nebuchadnezzar is cured when he &quot;[lifts] up [his] eyes to heaven&quot; and &quot;[acknowledges] that the Most High is sovereign&quot;. (An alternative reading with sound support, however, attributes the healing and forgiveness of Nabonidus' sins to God &lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Flint, ''The Daniel Tradition at Qumran'', in Collins et al. (2002), p.336.&lt;/ref&gt; )
# Nebuchadnezzar's illness occurs in Babylon; Nabonidus is stricken in Tema. (The end result, though, is that both kings are absent from Babylon for the duration of their illnesses, since Nebuchadnezzar is &quot;driven away from mankind.&quot; (4:33, NASB))
# Finally, some of the words and phrases of the prayer have to be inferred from the context because the text is fragmentary. [Archer, Gleason L. &quot;Daniel&quot;, &lt;U&gt;Expositor's&lt;/u&gt;. Vol. 7 (Zondervan, 1985): 15; he cites Harrison, R. K. &lt;U&gt;Introduction to the Old Testament&lt;/u&gt;. (Tyndale, 1969): 1118-9]

Some feel that the ''Prayer of Nabonidus'' shows signs of dependence upon the book of Daniel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Regardless of whether there is any direct literary dependence, however, the &quot;general consensus&quot; of scholars is that Daniel four ultimately draws upon traditions and legends about Nabonidus.&lt;ref name=&quot;collins&quot;&gt;{{|Collins|1994|p=217-218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthias Henze further suggests that the story of Nebuchadnezzar's madness draws on the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh. He argues that the author of Daniel uses elements from the description of the wild man Enkidu, who roams the steppe with the animals, to paint a sarcastic and mocking portrait of the king of Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;The Madness of King Nebuchadnezzar..., Leiden, Brill, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that a reference to the insanity of Nebuchadnezzar is to be found in a cuneiform text: BM 34113.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Date of Nebuchadnezzar's first siege of Jerusalem===
The Book of Daniel begins by stating:

:In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnez'zar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. ([[King James Version]])

This appears to be a description of the first siege of Jerusalem in 597 BC, which occurred in the 11th year of [[Jehoiakim]] and into the reign of his son [[Jehoiachin]]. (see ({{bibleverse||2Kings|24|KJV}}), ({{bibleverse||Daniel|5:1-5|KJV}}), and ({{bibleverse||2Chronicles|36|KJV}})). The third year of Jehoiakim (606 BC), saw Nebuchadnezzar not yet King of Babylon, and the Egyptians still dominant in the region. Nebuchadnezzar did not become &quot;King of Babylon&quot; until after the [[Battle of Carchemish]], in Jehoiakim's fourth year(Jer 25:1). In Jeremiah 36:9, we find Jehoiakim in Jerusalem in his fifth year, two years after the time that Daniel claims he was carried away to Babylon.

[[Rashi]] (ad loc.) clarifies this matter as follows. He quotes KingsII 24:1 which states that Jehoiakim, after being captured, served Nebuchadnezzar for three years and then rebelled against him. Daniel 1:1, says Rashi, refers to the third year of Jehoiakim's rebellion, which was within his eleventh year.

The ''Babylonian Chronicle'' records that Nebuchadnezzar first defeated the Egyptians under Pharaoh [[Necho II|Necho]] in [[Battle of Carchemish]]. He then conquered the whole of Hatti-land, a region that includes the kingdom of Judah. Apologists argue this would coincide with the coming of Nebuchadnezzar recorded in Dan 1:1. The historian Berossus records that Nebuchadnezzar took Jewish captives back to Babylon after the [[Battle of Carchemish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gaston|2009|pp=19–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Berossus]] account however is based on the mistaken premise that Babylonia already ruled Syria, Palestine and Egypt before the Battle of Carchemish. The Berrosus excerpts are very fragmented and may not have been preserved unadulterated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=Z9QUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA69 Studies on the Hasmonean period], Joshua Efrón, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiochus IV Epiphanes===
[[Image:Antiochos IV Epiphanes.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coin of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The reverse shows [[Zeus]] (''King of the Gods'') enthroned  carrying the Goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] (''Victory''). The legend reads: &quot;King Antiochus. God Manifest, Bearing Victory.&quot;]]
Critical scholars have asserted that the prophecies in the Book of Daniel reflect the persecutions of the Jews by the Greek [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] who ruled the Jews from 175&amp;ndash;164 BC, and his desecration of the altar in the temple at Jerusalem, and consequently they date its composition to that period. In particular, the vision in [[Daniel 11|Chapter 11]], which focuses on a series of wars between the &quot;King of the North&quot; and the &quot;King of the South&quot;, is generally interpreted as a record of Levantine history from the time of [[Alexander the Great]] down to the era of Antiochus IV, with the &quot;Kings of the North&quot; being the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid kings of Syria]] and the &quot;Kings of the South&quot; being the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt]].

Scottish theologian [[John Drane]] notes that other details of the stories in the early chapters of Daniel are also similar to the prevailing conditions in the era of Antiochus. &quot;Belshazzar for example, falls from power because he defiled the sacred objects taken from the Temple in Jerusalem (Dan. 5:1-4), in much the same way as Antiochus repeatedly robbed the Temple in Jerusalem. The worship of the great statue set up by Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 3:1-18) and the story of the [[Bel and the Dragon|Bel]] found in the [[Septuagint]] highlighted the same issues as Antiochus' action in setting up an image of [[Zeus]] in the Temple at Jerusalem. Indeed it may be implied that the images were actual statues of the kings themselves. Even the story of Nebuchadnezzar's madness (Dan. 4:19-33) may have been intended to be reminiscent of the commonly held belief that Antiochus was mad (&quot;[[epimanes]]&quot;). The people of a later age would also recognize those apostate Jews who collaborated with the unbelieving [[Seleucids]] in the duplicitous figures of the spies and informers who plotted against Daniel and ensured that he was shut up in the den of lions (Dan. 6:1-14). The issue of food, which features so largely in the opening story of Daniel (Dan. 1:3-16), was one of the whole crucial points in the whole argument about [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]]. Much of the opposition that sparked the [[Maccabean revolt]] was concerned with the unwillingness of faithful Jews to eat pork and other [[kashrut|unclean foods]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Introducing the Old Testament'' By John William Drane, John Drane, pp. 221-222&lt;/ref&gt; 

This conclusion regarding the date of composition was first drawn by the philosopher [[Porphyry of Tyros]], a 3rd century [[paganism|pagan]] and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]], whose fifteen-volume work ''Against the Christians'' is only known to us through [[Jerome]]'s reply. The ''identification'' of Antiochus Epiphanes in Daniel, however, is a much older&lt;ref&gt;Casey P.M, Porphyry and the origin of the Book of Daniel, ''Journal of Theological Studies'', 1976, pp. 15-33&lt;/ref&gt; interpretation which seems to be reflected, for example, in 1 Maccabees 1:54 (c100 BC), where an idol of [[Zeus]] set up upon the altar of burnt offering under Antiochus is referred to as an &quot;[[abomination of desolation]]&quot; (cf. Dan. 9:27, 11:31).&lt;ref&gt;Horrible abomination: šiqqǔṣ šômēm in the original Hebrew, a contemptuous pun on the title 'baal hashshamayim' (Lord of heaven), title of the Semitic storm god [[Hadad]] with whom Zeus Olympius had been identified. ''cf. e.g., J.A. Montgomery, Daniel, p. 388''&lt;/ref&gt; This identification is made explicit in Josephus' exposition of Daniel chapter eight (''Antiquities'' 10:11, c94 AD) where he almost certainly cites a common Jewish interpretative tradition by identifying the &quot;little horn&quot; as Antiochus. According to British historian [[Bryan Rennie]], the conclusion that the Book of Daniel was written at the time of the profanation of the Temple by Antiochus IV would explain why the author is not very precise about 6th century events, why he is so precise about the time of Antiochus, and why he was never counted among the prophets.&lt;ref name=&quot;rennie&quot;&gt;[http://www.westminster.edu/staff/brennie/rel101/daniel.htm The Dating of the Book of Daniel, [[Bryan Rennie]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars are virtually unanimous in regarding the Book of Daniel as a message of encouragement to those people([[Hasideans|hasidim]])&lt;ref&gt;Interpreting the Bible: a handbook of terms and methods, W.

===The Kingdoms===
====Pre-Roman interpretation====

Referencing the canonization of Jewish scripture, most likely ending during the [[Hasmonean|Hasmonean period]] (see [[Development of the Jewish canon]], the Jewish section of [[Bible canon]], as well as the section &quot;Antiochus Epiphanes&quot; above), most secular historians and higher critics, and some contemporary Jewish and Christian scholars advocate a scheme of interpreting the kingdoms in the Book of Daniel strictly within the context of the kingdoms that reigned over Judea from the [[Babylonian Empire]] to the [[Seleucids]] of Syria, dealing with other issues separately.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/re/jewish-apocalyptic_bruce.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.auss.info/auss_publication_file.php?pub_id=665&amp;journal=1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The prototypical pre-Roman scheme&lt;ref&gt;http://www.annettereed.com/RS-3R03/reed3R03_2-7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  includes:
# the [[Babylonian captivity|Neo-Babylonian]] period of involvement from ''c.'' 587–539 BC,
# the [[Achaemenid Empire|Medo-Persian]] period of involvement from ''c.'' 539–332 BC,
# the [[Macedonian Empire|Macedonian]] period of involvement, starting with [[Alexander the Great]] and continuing through the [[Diadochi]] from ''c.'' 332–305 BC to
# the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] period of involvement from ''c.'' 305–219 BC, and
# the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] period of involvement starting with [[Antiochus the Great|Antiochus III Megas]] and culimating in the events of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] and the confrontation with [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]].

The Maccabean Revolt concluded with the Jews' victory over the [[Seleucid empire|Seleucids]] on the [[Nicanor (Seleucid general)|Day of Nicanor]], 161 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=265&amp;letter=N Nicanor]&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate issues:

* Some secular historians and certain critics would say that the book of Daniel has little to no significance beyond its historical setting.{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}

* [[Reconstructionists]] of all types, [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealists]], and the advocates of [[Realized eschatology|Realized/Sapiential Eschatology]] would say that the Book of Daniel is primarily historical, but it is significant as godly instruction.

* In ''Revelation'' {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|17:10}}, John divided the kingdoms the same way as the Jews of his day would have, speaking of five kings that &quot;were&quot; (from Babylon to the Seleucids), one that &quot;is&quot; (the [[Roman Empire]]), with a seventh that was &quot;yet to come&quot; which would &quot;become an eighth, but is of the seven.&quot;

* Insofar as Judaism and Christianity is concerned, the Jews' cleansing of the Temple in Jerusalem near the midpoint of the Maccabean Revolt is commemorated annually at [[Hanukkah]], which Jesus observed according to John {{bibleverse-nb||John|10:22}}.

====Post-Roman interpretation====
[[Jewish eschatology|Jewish]] and Christian [[Historicism (Christianity)|Historicists]], [[Futurism (Christianity)|Futurists]], [[Dispensationalist]]s, [[Partial preterism|Partial Preterists]], and other futuristic Jewish and Christian hybrids, as well as certain [[Messianic Jews]] typically believe that the kingdoms in Daniel (with variations) are:

#the Neo-Babylonian Empire
#the Medo-Persian Empire
#the Macedonian Empire of Alexander and his successors to the Ptolomaic and Seleucid Empires together, and
#the Roman Empire, with other implications to come later.

This was the scheme described by [[Jerome]] in his &quot;Commentary on Daniel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/jerome_daniel_02_text.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Preterism|Full Preterists]], [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealists]], certain [[Christian Reconstructionism|Reconstructionists]] and other non-futurists likewise typically believe in the same general sequence, but they teach that Daniel's prophecies ended with the destruction of the Second Temple of Jerusalem, and have little to no implications beyond that.

All of these schools of prophetic thought typically start from the same basic premise (with variations), but differ in their conclusions (as described afterward):

* Other scholars argue that there was a split between the [[Medes]] and [[Persian empire|Persians]].&lt;ref&gt;A short introduction to the Hebrew Bible, John J. Collins, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate issues:

''The following statements are archetypical, and do not represent every variant of this mode of interpreting Daniel's kingdoms:''

* [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish]] and Christian [[Historicism (Christianity)|Historicists]] (as generally taught in the Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant Churches [see [[Historicism (Christianity)]]]) believe that the fulfillment of the prophecies of Daniel continue in a straight line through to the End of the Age.

* [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish]] and Christian [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurists]], [[Dispensationalism|Dispensationalists]], and, to some degree, [[Partial preterism|Partial Preterists]] believe that the prophecies of Daniel stopped with the destruction of the Second Temple of Jerusalem and will resume at some point in the future after a gap in prophecy that accounts for the Church Age.

* [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Jewish Reconstructionists]] and [[Preterism|Full Preterists]] believe that Daniel is completely fulfilled, and that the believers are now working to establish the Kingdom of God on earth.

====Other views====

Others like Walton have advocated a combination of both schemes, but in different parts of Daniel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_daniel_walton.html &quot;The Four Kingdoms Of Daniel&quot;] by John H. Walton, ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 29.1 (1986): 25-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Scholars have speculated about the bilingual literary structure of Daniel - Chapters 2 through 7 in Aramaic, the rest in Hebrew.  One of the most frequent speculations is that the entire book (excepting 9:4-20) was originally written in Aramaic, with portions translated into Hebrew, possibly to increase acceptance&lt;ref&gt;Hartman and Di Lella, (1990), 408.&lt;/ref&gt; - many Aramaisms in the Hebrew text find proposed explanation by the hypothesis of an inexact initial translation into Hebrew.

According to John Collins in his 1993 commentary, ''Daniel, Hermeneia Commentary'', the Aramaic in Daniel is of a later form than that used in the Samaria correspondence, but slightly earlier than the form used in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], meaning that the Aramaic chapters 2-6 may have been written earlier in the Hellenistic period than the rest of the book, with the vision in chapter 7 being the only Aramaic portion dating to the time of Antiochus.  The Hebrew portion is, for all intents and purposes, identical to that found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, meaning chapters 1 and 8-12 were in existence before the late 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Hermeneia Commentary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | title = The Skeptical Review Online
  | url = http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/2001/3/013mail.html 2
  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the above, the ''Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Zondervan, 1990) claims that the language of Daniel, in comparison with the Hebrew and Aramaic texts of the Hellenistic period, &quot;prove quite conclusively to any scholar that the second-century date and Palestinian provenance of the Book of Daniel cannot be upheld any longer without violence being done to the science of linguistics.&quot; It adds that the serious mistakes of the Septuagint to render many Persian and Accadian terms, as the offices mentioned in Dan. 3:3, proves ignorance of words of the old past, already forgotten in the Hellenistic period, indicating that the Book of Daniel was written in the late 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;There is no possibility that the text of Daniel could have been composed as late as the Maccabean uprising, and that there is every likelihood that the Aramaic comes from the same period, if not a century earlier, than the Aramaic of the [[Elephantine Papyri]] and of Ezra, which are admittedly fifth-century productions. It goes without saying that if the predictions concerning the period of Antiochus III and Antiochus IV (222-164 BC) are composed in language antedating the second-century and third-century B.C., then the whole effort to explain Daniel as a vaticinium ex eventu must be abandoned.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

E.C. Lucas is more cautious in his assessment of linguistic arguments as well. Evaluating Collins' approach, he considers &quot;the wide geographical spread from which the material comes and the implicit assumption that linguistic developments would have occurred uniformly throughout this area&quot; a weakness and concludes, &quot;The character of the Hebrew and Aramaic could support a date in the fifth or fourth century for the extant written form of the book, but does not demand a second-century date.&quot; He agrees with Collins that there are &quot;clear differences&quot; between Qumran Hebrew and the Hebrew of Daniel.&lt;ref&gt;E.C. Lucas, ''Daniel'' (Apollos OT Commentary; Apollos, 2002) p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loan words===
Three Greek words used within the text have long been considered evidence for a late dating of Daniel.  All three are terms for musical instruments: ''κιθαρις'' ([[cithara]]), ''ψαλτηριον'' ([[psaltery]]) and ''συμφωνια'' ([[symphonia]]). The existence of the Greek word ''symphonia'' was cited by Rowlings as having its earliest known use in the 2nd century BC, but it has subsequently been shown that Pythagoras, born in the 6th century BC, used the term,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

It is known that &quot;Greek mercenaries and slaves served in the Babylonian and Assyrian periods, some of whom were undoubtedly versed in Greek music and musical instruments.&quot; It has been speculated{{By whom|date=January 2011}} that this would explain the existence of the three Greek musical terms in Daniel's book. On the other hand, it has been claimed that the non-existence of other Greek words is a strong witness against the theory of the writing of the book in the Hellenistic period, since &quot;it is inconceivable that Greek terms for government and administration would not have been adopted into Aramaic by the second century BC&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank E. Gaebelein]], ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'', Vol. 7, Zondervan, 1985, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[John Goldingay]], a proponent of the late date, admits &quot;the Greek words hardly necessitate a very late date.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;John E. Goldingay, Daniel, (Word Biblical Commentary, 30; Dallas: Word Books, 1989), p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also nineteen Persian loan-words in the book, most of them having to do with governmental positions. Judea was under Persian administration for two centuries until the arrival of [[Alexander the Great]] in 333 BC.

===Use of the word 'Chaldeans'===
The book of Daniel uses the term &quot;[[Chaldea]]n&quot; to refer both to an ethnic group, and to astrologers in general.  According to Montgomery and Hammer {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Daniel's use of the word 'Chaldean' to refer to astrologers in general is an [[anachronism]], as during the Neo-Babylonian and early Persian periods (when Daniel is said to have lived), it referred only to an ethnicity. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} (Compare the later [[Chaldean Oracles]]).

==Unity of Daniel==
There exists a broad consensus among scholars that the legendary stories of chapters 1-6 are almost certainly older than the visions in chapters 7-12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=X-XYJ0yp140C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+book+of+Daniel:+composition+and+reception+John+Joseph+Collins,+Peter+W.+Flint,+Cameron+VanEpps&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zLmCM-SJYN&amp;sig=FR1Y-2FdZVPmNRsiMqTqbYvcbLU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4Wm9TP3ZEcHXcb6VwMQN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Collins, John Joseph, Flint, Peter W., VanEpps, Cameron (eds)' &quot;The book of Daniel: composition and reception&quot; (Brill, 2001)] p.2&lt;/ref&gt; The wide differences between the oldest manuscripts of chapters 4-6 suggests that these chapters originally circulated separately from the rest of the book and may have been transmitted orally,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=X-XYJ0yp140C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+book+of+Daniel:+composition+and+reception+John+Joseph+Collins,+Peter+W.+Flint,+Cameron+VanEpps&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zLmCM-SJYN&amp;sig=FR1Y-2FdZVPmNRsiMqTqbYvcbLU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4Wm9TP3ZEcHXcb6VwMQN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Collins, John Joseph, Flint, Peter W., VanEpps, Cameron (eds)' &quot;The book of Daniel: composition and reception&quot; (Brill, 2001)] p.3&lt;/ref&gt; and it is clear that the stories and visions that make up the book as we now have it were selected from a wider corpus of Daniel literature available to the author(s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=X-XYJ0yp140C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+book+of+Daniel:+composition+and+reception+John+Joseph+Collins,+Peter+W.+Flint,+Cameron+VanEpps&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zLmCM-SJYN&amp;sig=FR1Y-2FdZVPmNRsiMqTqbYvcbLU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4Wm9TP3ZEcHXcb6VwMQN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Collins, John Joseph, Flint, Peter W., VanEpps, Cameron (eds)' &quot;The book of Daniel: composition and reception&quot; (Brill, 2001)] p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian uses of Daniel==
{{Christian Eschatology}}

The &quot;Song of the Three Holy Youths&quot; is part of the [[Matins]] service in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and of [[Lauds]] on Sundays and feast days in [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].

The various episodes in the first half of the book are used by Christians as moral stories, and are often believed to foreshadow events in the [[gospel]]s.

The apocalyptic section is important to Christians for the image of the &quot;one like a [[son of Man]]&quot; (Dan. 7:13),&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/daniel/7-13.htm Parallel translations of Daniel 7:13]&lt;/ref&gt; and Jesus is presented using the same wording in the [[Book of Revelation]] in 1:13-15.&lt;ref name=Bromiley1995&gt;{{Cite book| title = International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: K-P Volume 3 of The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia| url = http://books.google.com/?id=r7QTYwYvvx0C&amp;pg=PA800| year = 1995| author = Bromiley, Geoffrey W.| publisher = Wm.

Christians sometimes see this as a claim by Jesus that he is the [[Messiah]].  According to the [[New American Bible]] and some Christian theologians, &quot;one like a son of man&quot; represents &quot;the saints of the Most High&quot; as interpreted in the vision later (Dan 7:16-18, 21-22, 25-27) and Jesus made the title &quot;Son of Man&quot; a distinguishing self reference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/daniel/daniel7.htm#foot8 New American Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=GP2VY68mp7AC&amp;pg=PA233 Introducing the New Testament: its literature and theology], [[Paul J.

Traditional Christians have embraced the prophecies of the Book of Daniel, as they believe they were clearly advised by their [[Christ|Messiah]], Jesus, to be watchful for their fulfillment in the &quot;[[end times]]&quot; of this world. In the [[Olivet discourse]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|13:14|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Matt.|24:15|NIV}}) Jesus applies Daniel's prophecy of a [[desolating sacrilege]] set up in the temple (Dan. 9:27, 11:31) to a future event—the [[siege of Jerusalem (70)|CE 70 destruction of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig Blomberg]], Jesus and the Gospels, Apollos 1997, pp.322-326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;christian_origins_and_the_question_of_god_a01&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Wright | first1 = N. T. | title = Christian origins and the question of God.

Many Christians today re-apply this prediction to a final tribulation immediately preceding [[last judgment|Judgement Day]]. Some consider the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks]] to be particularly compelling due to what they interpret to be prophetic accuracy.

According to some scholars, Dan. 12:2 is the earliest clear reference in the Hebrew Scriptures to the [[resurrection of the dead]],&lt;ref&gt;Hartman and Di Lella, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;419&lt;/ref&gt; with many &quot;countrymen&quot; awakening from death, some to eternal life and some to eternal disgrace. This belief is also expressed in [[2 Maccabees]] and is linked, as in Daniel, with the idea of divine retribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=WtnR-6_PlJAC&amp;pg=PA1444 Encyclopedia of theology: the concise Sacramentum mundi],  Karl Rahner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2 Macc. 7:14 : &quot;And when he was now ready to die, he spoke thus: It is better, being put to death by men, to look for hope from God, to be raised up again by him; for, as to thee (Antiochus Epiphanes), thou shalt have no resurrection unto life&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of [[resurrection]] was to be elaborated in the New Testament and Christian doctrine.

'''Batman''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] created by the artist [[Bob Kane]] and writer [[Bill Finger]]. A [[comic book]] [[superhero]], Batman first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #27 (May 1939), and since then has appeared in many of [[DC Comics]]’ publications. Originally referred to as &quot;'''the Bat-Man'''&quot; and still referred to at times as &quot;'''the Batman'''&quot;, he is additionally known as &quot;'''The Caped Crusader'''&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleisher&quot;&gt;Fleisher, Michael L. ''The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes Volume 1 Batman'' Collier Books 1976 ISBN 0-02-080090-8 p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;'''The Dark Knight'''&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleisher&quot;/&gt;  &quot;'''The Darknight Detective'''&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleisher&quot;/&gt; and &quot;'''The World's Greatest Detective'''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleisher&quot;/&gt;

In the original version of the story and the vast majority of retellings, Batman's [[secret identity]] is '''Bruce Wayne''', an American millionaire (later billionaire) playboy, industrialist, and philanthropist. Having witnessed the murder of his parents as a child, he swore revenge on crime, an oath tempered with the greater ideal of justice. Wayne trains himself both physically and intellectually and dons a [[bat]]-themed costume in order to fight crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = | contribution = Batman | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 40–44 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batman operates in the fictional American [[Gotham City]], assisted by various supporting characters including his crime-fighting partner, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], his butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the police commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]], and occasionally the heroine [[Batgirl]]. He fights an assortment of villains such as the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], [[Two-Face]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Catwoman]]. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]; he makes use of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, martial arts skills, an indomitable will, fear, and intimidation in his continuous war on crime.

Batman became a very popular character soon after his introduction and gained his own comic book title, ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'', in 1940. As the decades wore on, differing interpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' [[Television program|television series]] used a [[Camp (style)|camp]] aesthetic which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in the 1986 miniseries ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'', by writer-artist [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], while the success of [[Film director|director]] [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' also helped to reignite popular interest in the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Big Question: What is the history of Batman, and why does he still appeal? |publisher=[[The Independent]] |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/the-big-question-what-is-the-history-of-batman-and-why-does-he-still-appeal-873780.html | location=London | date=July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cultural icon]], Batman has been [[Batman franchise media|licensed and adapted into a variety of media]], from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world such as [[toy]]s and [[video game]]s. In May of 2011, Batman placed 2nd on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==

{{See also|List of Batman comics}}

===Creation===
In early 1939, the success of [[Superman]] in ''[[Action Comics]]'' prompted editors at the comic book division of [[National Publications]] (the future DC Comics) to request more superheroes for its titles. In response, [[Bob Kane]] created &quot;the Bat-Man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Les Daniels|Daniels, Les]]. ''Batman: The Complete History''. Chronicle Books, 1999. ISBN 0-8118-4232-0, pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborator [[Bill Finger]] recalled &quot;Kane had an idea for a character called 'Batman', and he'd like me to see the drawings. I went over to Kane's, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of ... reddish tights, I believe, with boots ... no gloves, no gauntlets ... with a small [[domino mask]], swinging on a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it was a big sign ... BATMAN.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Steranko|Steranko, Jim]]. ''The Steranko History of Comics 1''. Reading, PA: Supergraphics, 1970. (ISBN 0-517-50188-0)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finger offered such suggestions as giving the character a [[cowl]] instead of a simple domino mask, a cape instead of wings, and gloves, and removing the red sections from the original costume.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 21, 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Havholm, Peter|title=Corporate Authorship: A Response to Jerome Christensen|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=30|issue=1|month=Autumn|year=2003|page=192|issn=00931896|doi=10.1086/380810|last2=Sandifer|first2=Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Archives 3&quot;&gt;Biography by Joe Desris, in ''Batman Archives'', Volume 3 ([[DC Comics]], 1994), p. 223 ISBN 1-56389-099-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Les Daniels |last=Daniels |first=Les |title=Batman: The Complete History |publisher=Chronicle Books |year=1999 |isbn=0-8118-4232-0 |pages=21, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finger said he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity: &quot;Bruce Wayne's first name came from [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]], the [[Scotland|Scottish]] patriot. Bruce, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock ... then I thought of [[Anthony Wayne|Mad Anthony Wayne]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;creation&quot;&gt;Kane, Andrae, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; He later said his suggestions were influenced by [[Lee Falk]]'s popular ''[[The Phantom]]'', a [[Print syndication|syndicated]] [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] character with which Kane was familiar as well.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Kane, Andrae, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Various aspects of Batman's personality, character history, visual design, and equipment were inspired by contemporary popular culture of the 1930s, including movies, pulp magazines, comic strips, newspaper headlines, and even aspects of Kane himself.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Les. ''DC Comics: A Celebration of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes''. New York: Billboard Books/Watson-Guptill Publications, 2003, ISBN 0-8230-7919-8, pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Kane noted especially the influence of the films ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and ''[[The Bat Whispers]]'' (1930) in the creation of the iconography associated with the character, while Finger drew inspiration from literary characters [[Doc Savage]], [[The Shadow]], and [[Sherlock Holmes]] in his depiction of Batman as a master sleuth and scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, Bill. &quot;Batman: Commodity as Myth.&quot; ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. ISBN 0-85170-276-7, pg. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Kane, in his 1989 [[autobiography]], detailed Finger's contributions to Batman's creation:
{{quote|One day I called Bill and said, 'I have a new character called the Bat-Man and I've made some crude, elementary sketches I'd like you to look at'. He came over and I showed him the drawings. At the time, I only had a small domino mask, like the one Robin later wore, on Batman's face. Bill said, 'Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious?' At this point, the Bat-Man wore a red union suit; the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good combination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: 'Color it dark gray to make it look more ominous'. The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill and I talked, we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action, and changed them into a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope. Also, he didn't have any gloves on, and we added them so that he wouldn't leave fingerprints.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}

Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. This byline did not, originally, say &quot;Batman created by Bob Kane&quot;; his name was simply written on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced by credits for each story's actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] began receiving a &quot;created by&quot; credit on the Superman titles, along with [[William Moulton Marston]] being given the byline for creating [[Wonder Woman]], Batman stories began saying &quot;Created by Bob Kane&quot; in addition to the other credits.

Finger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he began, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing; in the letters page of ''Batman'' #169 (February 1965) for example, editor [[Julius Schwartz]] names him as the creator of the [[Riddler]], one of Batman's recurring villains. However, Finger's contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline. Kane wrote, &quot;Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career. He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;creation&quot; /&gt; At the time of Finger's death in 1974, DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co-creator.

[[Jerry Robinson]], who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit. He recalled Finger resenting his position, stating in a 2005 interview with ''[[The Comics Journal]]'':
{{quote|Bob made him more insecure, because while he slaved working on Batman, he wasn't sharing in any of the glory or the money that Bob began to make, which is why... [he was] going to leave [Kane's employ]. ... [Kane] should have credited Bill as co-creator, because I know; I was there. ... That was one thing I would never forgive Bob for, was not to take care of Bill or recognize his vital role in the creation of Batman. As with Siegel and Shuster, it should have been the same, the same co-creator credit in the strip, writer and artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Groth |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Groth |year=2005 |month=October |title=Jerry Robinson |journal=The Comics Journal |volume=1 |issue=271 |pages=80–81 |issn=0194-7869 |url=http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=350&amp;Itemid=48 |accessdate= 2007-11-18 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Kane initially rebutted Finger's claims at having created the character, writing in a 1965 open letter to fans that &quot;it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Batman, t' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[sic]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters. This statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue.&quot; Kane himself also commented on Finger's lack of credit. &quot;The trouble with being a 'ghost' writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without 'credit'. However, if one wants the 'credit', then one has to cease being a 'ghost' or follower and become a leader or innovator.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' 3. Winter 1999. [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Kane revisited Finger's situation, recalling in an interview, {{quote|In those days it was like, one artist and he had his name over it [the comic strip] — the policy of DC in the comic books was, if you can't write it, obtain other writers, but their names would never appear on the comic book in the finished version. So Bill never asked me for it [the byline] and I never volunteered — I guess my ego at that time. And I felt badly, really, when he [Finger] died.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Comic Book Interview Super Special: Batman&quot; Fictioneer Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Early years===
[[File:Detective Comics 27.jpg|thumb|Batman made his debut in ''Detective Comics'' #27 (May 1939). Cover art by [[Bob Kane]]]]
The first Batman story, &quot;The Case of the Chemical Syndicate,&quot; was published in ''Detective Comics'' #27 (May 1939). Finger said, &quot;Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals. Batman proved a hit character, and he received his own solo title in 1940, while continuing to star in ''Detective Comics''. By that time, National was the top-selling and most influential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company's other major hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Bradford W. ''Comic Book Nation''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 2001. ISBN 0-8018-7450-5, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The two characters were featured side-by-side as the stars of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', which was originally titled ''World's Best Comics'' when it debuted in fall 1940. Creators including [[Jerry Robinson]] and [[Dick Sprang]] also worked on the strips during this period.

Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved. Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character's jawline more pronounced, and lengthened the ears on the costume. &quot;About a year later he was almost the full figure, my mature Batman,&quot; Kane said.&lt;ref name = &quot;vapzdg&quot;&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Batman's utility belt|Batman's characteristic utility belt]] was introduced in ''Detective Comics'' #29 (July 1939), followed by the [[boomerang]]-like batarang and the first bat-themed vehicle, the [[Batplane]], in #31 (September 1939). The character's origin was revealed in #33 (November 1939), unfolding in a two-page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by the death of his parents. Written by Finger, it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. Days later, at their grave, the child vows that &quot;by the spirits of my parents [I will] avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane]]|inker=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|issue=33|title=Detective Comics|story=The Batman and How He Came to Be|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|date=November, 1939|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=560 ''Detective Comics'' #33] (November 1939), [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Jefferson Darowski, &quot;[http://www.pdfdownload.org/pdf2html/pdf2html.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontentdm.lib.byu.edu%2FETD%2Fimage%2Fetd2158.pdf&amp;images=yes The Mythic Symbols of Batman]&quot; December 2007. Retrieved 2008-03-20. [http://www.webcitation.org/5WSVLWqAU Archived] on 2008-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early, pulp-inflected portrayal of Batman started to soften in ''Detective Comics'' #38 (April 1940) with the introduction of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], Batman's kid sidekick.&lt;ref name = &quot;Wright_p17&quot;&gt;Wright, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Robin was introduced, based on Finger's suggestion Batman needed a &quot;[[Doctor Watson|Watson]]&quot; with whom Batman could talk.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Sales nearly doubled, despite Kane's preference for a solo Batman, and it sparked a proliferation of &quot;kid sidekicks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (2003), pg. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of the solo spin-off series ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent antagonists, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and [[Catwoman]], but for a story in which Batman shoots some monstrous giants to death. That story prompted editor [[Whitney Ellsworth]] to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun.&lt;ref name=dan42&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1942, the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the Batman mythos.&lt;ref name = &quot;Boichel_p9&quot;&gt;Boichel, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following [[World War II]], DC Comics &quot;adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de-emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy.&quot; The impact of this editorial approach was evident in ''Batman'' comics of the postwar period; removed from the &quot;bleak and menacing world&quot; of the strips of the early 1940s, Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a &quot;bright and colorful&quot; environment.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1950s and early 1960s===
Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s. In the story &quot;The Mightiest Team in the World&quot; in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #76 (June 1952), Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discovers each other's secret identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference|writer=[[Edmund Hamilton]]|penciller=[[Curt Swan]]|story=The Mightiest Team In the World|title=Superman #76|date=June 1952|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of this story, ''World's Finest Comics'' was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together, instead of the separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The team-up of the characters was &quot;a financial success in an era when those were few and far between&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 91&lt;/ref&gt; this series of stories ran until the book's cancellation in 1986.

Batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' in 1954. Wertham's thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books, and that these works corrupt the morals of the youth. Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Wertham's criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s, eventually leading to the establishment of the [[Comics Code Authority]]. The tendency towards a &quot;sunnier Batman&quot; in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the Comics Code.&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested by scholars that the characters of [[Batwoman]] (in 1956) and the pre-[[Barbara Gordon]] [[Bette Kane|Bat-Girl]] (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay, and the stories took on a campier, lighter feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=York |first=Christopher |title=All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s |journal=The International Journal of Comic Art |year=2000 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=100–110 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s, Batman stories gradually became more [[science fiction]]-oriented, an attempt at mimicking the success of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 94&lt;/ref&gt; New characters such as Batwoman, [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], and [[Bat-Mite]] were introduced. Batman's adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre space aliens. In 1960, Batman debuted as a member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #28 (February 1960), and went on to appear in several Justice League comic series starting later that same year.

===&quot;New Look&quot; Batman and camp===
By 1964, sales on Batman titles had fallen drastically. Bob Kane noted that, as a result, DC was &quot;planning to kill Batman off altogether.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 95&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, editor [[Julius Schwartz]] was assigned to the Batman titles. He presided over drastic changes, beginning with 1964's ''Detective Comics'' #327 (May 1964), which was cover-billed as the &quot;New Look&quot;. Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary, and to return him to more detective-oriented stories. He brought in artist [[Carmine Infantino]] to help overhaul the character. The [[Batmobile]] was redesigned, and Batman's costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat-insignia. The space aliens and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman, Ace, and Bat-Mite were retired. Batman's butler Alfred was killed off (though his death was quickly reversed due to fan response) while a new female relative for the Wayne family, Aunt Harriet, came to live with Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|story=Gotham Gang Line-Up!|title=[[Detective Comics]]|issue=328|date=June, 1964|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debut of the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character. The success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry, and ''Batman'' reached a circulation of close to 900,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, Mike. ''The Comic Book in America: An Illustrated History''. Dallas: Taylor, 1989. ISBN 0-87833-659-1, pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Elements such as the character of [[Batgirl]] and the show's [[Camp (style)|campy]] nature were introduced into the comics; the series also initiated the return of Alfred. Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time, the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968. In the aftermath, the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again. As Julius Schwartz noted, &quot;When the television show was a success, I was asked to be campy, and of course when the show faded, so did the comic books.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1969, writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]] made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from the campy portrayal of the 1960s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a &quot;grim avenger of the night.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pg. 233&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neil said his idea was &quot;simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Roberta E.; Uricchio, William. &quot;Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil.&quot; ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. ISBN 0-85170-276-7, pg. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neil and Adams first collaborated on the story &quot;The Secret of the Waiting Graves&quot; (''Detective Comics'' #395, January 1970). Few stories were true collaborations between O'Neil, Adams, Schwartz, and inker [[Dick Giordano]], and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s; nevertheless the influence of their work was &quot;tremendous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Giordano said: &quot;We went back to a grimmer, darker Batman, and I think that's why these stories did so well... Even today we're still using Neal's Batman with the long flowing cape and the pointy ears.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 141&lt;/ref&gt; While the work of O'Neil and Adams was popular with fans, the acclaim did little to help declining sales; the same held true with a similarly acclaimed run by writer [[Steve Englehart]] and penciler [[Marshall Rogers]] in ''Detective Comics'' #471-476 (August 1977 - April 1978), which went on to influence the 1989 movie ''Batman'' and be adapted for ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', which debuted in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=5&amp;id=40748 SciFi Wire (March 28, 2007): &quot;Batman Artist Rogers is Dead&quot;]: &quot;Even though their Batman run was only six issues, the three laid the foundation for later Batman comics. Their stories include the classic 'Laughing Fish' (in which the Joker's face appeared on fish); they were adapted for ''Batman: The Animated Series'' in the 1990s. Earlier drafts of the 1989 Batman movie with Michael Keaton as the Dark Knight were based heavily on their work.&quot;{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, circulation continued to drop through the 1970s and 1980s, hitting an all-time low in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Dark Knight Returns'' and later===
{{See also|Alternate versions of Batman}}
[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s limited series ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (Feb.-June 1986), which tells the story of a 50-year old Batman coming out of retirement in a possible future, reinvigorated the character. ''The Dark Knight Returns'' was a financial success and has since become one of the medium's most noted touchstones.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 147, 149&lt;/ref&gt; The series also sparked a major resurgence in the character's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, pg. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

That year Dennis O'Neil took over as editor of the Batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of Batman following DC's status quo-altering miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. O'Neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 155, 157&lt;/ref&gt; One outcome of this new approach was the &quot;[[Batman: Year One|Year One]]&quot; storyline in ''Batman'' #404-407 (Feb.-May 1987), in which Frank Miller and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] redefined the character's origins. Writer [[Alan Moore]] and artist [[Brian Bolland]] continued this dark trend with 1988's 48-page [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'', in which the Joker, attempting to drive [[Commissioner Gordon]] insane, cripples Gordon's daughter [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara]], and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner, physically and psychologically.

The Batman comics garnered major attention in 1988 when DC Comics created a [[Premium-rate telephone number|900 number]] for readers to call to vote on whether [[Jason Todd]], the second Robin, lived or died. Voters decided in favor of Jason's death by a narrow margin of 28 votes (see ''[[Batman: A Death in the Family]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 161&lt;/ref&gt; The following year saw the release of [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' feature film, which firmly brought the character back to the public's attention, grossing millions of dollars at the box office, and millions more in merchandising. However, the three sequels, Tim Burton's ''[[Batman Returns]]'' and director [[Joel Schumacher]]'s ''[[Batman Forever]]'' and ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'', did not perform as well at the box office. The ''Batman'' movie franchise was rebooted with director and co-writer [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[Batman Begins]]'' in 2005 and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' in 2008. In 1989, the first issue of ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'', the first new solo Batman title in nearly fifty years, sold close to a million copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Pearson, Roberta E.; Uricchio, William. &quot;Introduction.&quot; ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''.

The 1993 &quot;[[Knightfall]]&quot; story arc introduced a new villain, [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], who critically injures Bruce Wayne. Jean-Paul Valley, known as [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]], is called upon to wear the Batsuit during Wayne's convalescence. Writers [[Doug Moench]], [[Chuck Dixon]], and [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] worked on the Batman titles during &quot;Knightfall,&quot; and would also contribute to other Batman crossovers throughout the 1990s. 1998's &quot;[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]&quot; storyline served as the precursor to 1999's &quot;[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]&quot;, a year-long storyline that ran through all the Batman-related titles dealing with the effects of an [[earthquake]]-ravaged Gotham City. At the conclusion of &quot;No Man's Land&quot;, O'Neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by [[Bob Schreck]].

Another writer who rose to prominence on the Batman comic series, was [[Jeph Loeb]]. Along with longtime collaborator Tim Sale, they wrote two miniseries (&quot;The Long Halloween&quot; and &quot;Dark Victory&quot;) that pit an early in his career version of Batman against his entire rogue's gallery (most notably Two-Face, whose origin was re-envisioned by Loeb) while dealing with various mysteries involving serial killers Holiday and the Hangman, of which the former was the subject of intense debate and speculation amongst Batman fans. In 2003, Loeb teamed with artist [[Jim Lee]] to work on another mystery arc: &quot;[[Batman: Hush]]&quot; for the main Batman book. The twelve issue storyline saw Batman and Catwoman running the gauntlet against Batman's entire rogue's gallery, including an apparently resurrected Jason Todd, while seeking to find the identity of the mysterious supervillain Hush. While the character of Hush failed to catch on with readers, the arc was a sales success for DC. As the storyline was Jim Lee's first regular comic book work in nearly a decade, the series became #1 on the [[Diamond Comic Distributors]] sales chart for the first time since ''Batman'' #500 (October 1993) and Jason Todd's appearance laid the groundwork for writer [[Judd Winick]]'s subsequent run as writer on ''Batman'', with another multi-issue epic, &quot;Under the Hood,&quot; which ran from ''Batman'' #637-650.

In 2005, DC launched ''[[All-Star Batman and Robin]]'', a stand-alone comic series set outside the existing DC Universe. Written by Frank Miller and drawn by Jim Lee, the series was a commercial success for DC Comics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2006| title=Diamond's 2005 Year-End Sales Charts &amp; Market Share | format=http | work=newsarama.com | url=http://www.newsarama.com/marketreport/05Year_End.html | archivedate=May 25, 2006 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060525013002/http://www.newsarama.com/marketreport/05Year_End.html | accessdate=October 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2005| title=July 2005 Sales Charts: All-Star Batman &amp; Robin Lives Up To Its Name | format=http | work=newsarama.com | url=http://www.newsarama.com/marketreport/july05sales.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060907063905/http://www.newsarama.com/marketreport/july05sales.html|archivedate=September 7, 2006| accessdate=October 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; though widely panned by critics for its writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craveonline.com/articles/comics/04649326/all_star_batman_and_robin.html Review by Iann Robinson], Crave Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popmatters.com/comics/all-star-batman-robin-1-3.shtml Review by William Gatevackes], PopMatters, 10 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2006, the regular writers on ''Batman'' and ''Detective Comics'' were [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Paul Dini]], with Grant Morrison reincorporating controversial elements of Batman lore (most notably, the science fiction themed storylines of the 1950s Batman comics, which Morrison revised as hallucinations Batman suffered under the influence of various mind-bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training) into the character. Morrison's run climaxed with &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot;, which brought Batman up against the villainous &quot;Black Glove&quot; organization, which sought to drive Batman into madness. &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; segued into ''[[Final Crisis]]'' (also written by Morrison), which saw the apparent death of Batman at the hands of [[Darkseid]]. In the 2009 miniseries ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'', Wayne's former protégé Dick Grayson becomes the new Batman, and Wayne's son Damian becomes the new Robin.&lt;ref name=&quot;comics.ign.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Dan |title=Grant Morrison's New Batman and Robin |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/986/986031p1.html |date=August 8, 2009 |work= |publisher=IGN |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=George |first=Richard |title=Morrison discusses ''Batman and Robin'' |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/961/961488p1.html |date=March 11, 2009 |work= |publisher=IGN |accessdate=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Judd Winick returned to writing ''Batman'', while Grant Morrison was given his own series, titled ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;io9&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilkins |first=Alasdair |title=Batman Is Reborn...With A Vengeance |url=http://io9.com/5303197/batman-is-rebornwith-a-vengeance |date=June 27, 2009 |work=[[io9]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Batman's history has undergone various revisions, both minor and major. Few elements of the character's history have remained constant. Scholars William Uricchio and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s, &quot;Unlike some fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, pg. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character's [[origin story]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pearson pg 186&quot; /&gt; As a little boy, Bruce Wayne is horrified and traumatized to see his parents, the physician Dr. [[Thomas Wayne]] and his wife [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], being murdered by a mugger in front of his very eyes. This drives him to fight crime in [[Gotham City]] as Batman. Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, &quot;Until recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pearson pg 186&quot;&gt;Pearson; Uricchio. &quot;'I'm Not Fooled By That Cheap Disguise.'&quot; Pg. 186&lt;/ref&gt; a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;pearson pg 191&quot;&gt;Pearson, pg. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golden Age===
In Batman's first appearance in ''Detective Comics'' #27, he is already operating as a crime fighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane]]|story=The Case of the Chemical Syndicate|title=Detective Comics #27|date=May, 1939|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batman's origin is first presented in ''Detective Comics'' #33 (Nov. 1939), and is later fleshed out in ''Batman'' #47. As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable [[Gotham City]] socialites. Bruce is brought up in [[Wayne Manor]], with its wealthy splendor, and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named [[Joe Chill]] while on their way home from a movie theater. Bruce Wayne swears an oath to rid the city of the evil that had taken his parents' lives. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. &quot;Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot,&quot; Wayne remarks, &quot;so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible...&quot; As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to take on the persona of Batman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Bill Finger|penciller=Bob Kane|story=The Batman Wars Against the Dirigible of Doom|title=Detective Comics #33|date=November, 1939|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police. During this period Wayne has a fiancée named [[Julie Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;She first appears in ''Detective Comics'' #31 (Sept. 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his sidekick, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Paul Levitz]]|penciller=[[Joe Staton]]|story=The Untold Origin of the Justice Society |title=DC Special|issue=29|date=August/September 1977|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he, like Superman, is an honorary member,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Gardner Fox]]|penciller= |story= |title=[[All Star Comics]]|issue=3|date=Winter 1940/41|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of [[Gotham City Police Department|Gotham City's police department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Bob Kane]]|story= |title=Batman|issue=7|date=November, 1941|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, butler Alfred Pennyworth arrives at Wayne Manor, and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities joins their service.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #16 (May 1943); his original last name, Beagle, is revealed in ''Detective Comics'' #96 (Feb. 1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silver Age===
{{See also|Batman (Earth-Two)}}
The [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] as a new, updated version of [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]. Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as [[Earth-One]]. The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature a large number of science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until ''Detective Comics'' #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.

After the introduction of DC Comics' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle (as shown in ''[[Superman Family]]'' #211) and fathers [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]], who, as the Huntress, becomes (along with Dick Grayson, the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Robin]]) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or [[Green Lantern]], Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would on occasion make reference to stories from the Golden Age.&lt;ref&gt;One example is the Englehart/Rogers run of the late 1970s, which has editorial notes directing readers to issues such as ''Batman'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in ''Batman'' #208, January/February 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|story=The First Batman|title=Detective Comics|issue=235|date=September, 1956|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Edmond Hamilton]]|penciller=[[Dick Sprang]]|story=When Batman Was Robin|title=Detective Comics|issue=226|date=December, 1955|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 then-editor [[Paul Levitz]] commissioned the ''Untold Legend of the Batman'' [[limited series]] to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.

Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. Batman becomes a founding member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], appearing in its first story in 1960s ''[[Brave and the Bold]]'' #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''Brave and the Bold'' became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different [[DC Universe]] superhero each month.

In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from his mansion, [[Wayne Manor]] into a [[penthouse apartment]] atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl. Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of the Joker as a homicidal [[psychopathy|psychopath]], and the arrival of [[Ra's al Ghul]], a centuries-old [[terrorist]] who knows Batman's secret identity. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes [[Nightwing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

In the final issue of ''Brave and the Bold'' in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. He serves as the team's leader until ''Batman and the Outsiders'' #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.

===Modern Batman===
After the 12-issue [[limited series]] ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', DC Comics [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in the storyline &quot;[[Batman: Year One|Year One]]&quot; from ''Batman'' #404-407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Frank | authorlink = Frank Miller (comics)| coauthors = [[David Mazzucchelli]] and Richmond Lewis | title =[[Batman: Year One]] | publisher = [[DC Comics]] | year = 1987 | page = 98 | isbn = 1-85286-077-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence. While Dick Grayson's past remains much the same, the history of [[Jason Todd]], the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Max Allan Collins]]|penciller=[[Chris Warner]]|story=Did Robin Die Tonight?|title=Batman|issue=408|date=June, 1987|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following ''Crisis'', DC launched a new Batman title called ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the &quot;Year One&quot; period. Various stories from [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Matt Wagner]] also touch upon this era.

In 1988's &quot;[[Batman: A Death in the Family]]&quot; storyline from ''Batman'' #426-429 Jason Todd, the second Robin, is killed by the Joker.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt; Subsequently Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crime-fighting, a result of the pain of losing Jason Todd. Batman works solo until the decade's close, when [[Tim Drake]] becomes the new Robin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]|penciller=[[Norm Breyfogle]]|story=Master of Fear|title=[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]|issue=457|date=December, 1990|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, writers resurrected the Jason Todd character and have pitted him against his former mentor.

Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, DC published both the &quot;[[Death of Superman]]&quot; storyline and &quot;[[Knightfall]]&quot; . In the Knightfall storyline's first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] to take on the role. After the end of &quot;Knightfall,&quot; the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman's adventures, and Bruce Wayne's quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in &quot;KnightsEnd,&quot; as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains to return to the role.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Chuck. et al. &quot;Batman: Prodigal&quot;. ''Batman'' 512-514, ''Shadow of the Bat'' 32-34, ''Detective Comics'' 679-681, ''Robin'' 11-13. New York: DC Comics, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 company-wide crossover ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing [[Joe Chill]] from the new continuity, rendering stories such as &quot;Year Two&quot; non-canon.

Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the series, titled ''JLA''. While Batman contributes greatly to many of the team's successes, the Justice League is largely uninvolved as Batman and Gotham City face catastrophe in the decade's closing crossover arc. In 1998's &quot;[[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]&quot; storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States Government afterwards. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999's &quot;[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]&quot;.

Meanwhile, Batman's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of &quot;Batman: Officer Down&quot; and &quot;Batman: War Games/War Crimes&quot;; Batman's long-time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] are forced out of the police department in &quot;Officer Down&quot;, while &quot;War Games&quot; and &quot;War Crimes&quot; saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City's criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] the undisputed ruler of the city's criminal gangs. Other troubles come for Batman in the form of [[Lex Luthor]] (secretly behind the events of &quot;No Man's Land&quot;), who seeks revenge for Bruce Wayne cancelling all of his company's government contracts upon Luthor being elected [[President of the United States]]. Luthor arranges for the murder of Batman's on-again, off-again love interest Vesper (introduced in the mid-1990s) during the &quot;Bruce Wayne: Murderer?&quot; and &quot;[[Bruce Wayne: Fugitive]]&quot; story arcs. Though Batman is able to clear his name, he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha, who is recruited into the organization known as &quot;Checkmate&quot; while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn states evidence against her employer. While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper, Batman does get his revenge with help from [[Talia al Ghul]] in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #1-6: not only does he bring down Lex Luthor's Presidency but also engages in a hostile take-over of Luthor's corporate holdings, [[bankruptcy|bankrupting]] the villain in the process.

DC's 2005 [[limited series]] ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' reveals that JLA member [[Zatanna]] had edited Batman's memories to prevent him from stopping the League from [[lobotomy|lobotomizing]] [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] after he [[rape]]d [[Sue Dibny]]. This served as a retcon for Batman's complete distrust for his fellow superheroes, which, under writers such as Mark Waid in the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; arc in JLA, manifested itself in the form of Batman keeping extensive files on how to kill his fellow superheroes. Batman later creates the [[OMACs|Brother I]] satellite surveillance system to watch over and if necessary, kill the other heroes. It is eventually co-opted by [[Maxwell Lord]], who then kills superhero [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Blue Beetle]] to keep him from alerting the Justice League of the existence of Batman's murderous creation. The revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for Blue Beetle's death becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. In ''Infinite Crisis'' #7, [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] mentions that in the newly rewritten history of the &quot;[[Multiverse (DC Comics)|New Earth]]&quot;, created in the previous issue, the murderer of Martha and Thomas Wayne – again, Joe Chill – was captured, thus undoing the retcon created after ''Zero Hour''. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs, though at the very end Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing. Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger.

Following ''Infinite Crisis'', Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson (having recovered from his wounds), and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to &quot;rebuild Batman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #7, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Batman: Face the Face|Face the Face]]'' storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. Part of this absence is captured during Week 30 of the ''52'' series, which shows Batman fighting his inner demons.&lt;ref&gt;''52'' #30&lt;/ref&gt; Later on in ''52'', Batman is shown undergoing an intense meditation ritual in [[Nanda Parbat]]. This becomes an important part of the regular ''Batman'' title, which reveals that Batman is reborn as a more effective crime fighter while undergoing this ritual, having &quot;hunted down and ate&quot; the last traces of fear in his mind.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #673&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #681&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the &quot;Face the Face&quot; story arc, Bruce officially adopts Tim (who had lost both of his parents at various points in the character's history) as his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[James Dale Robinson|James Robinson]]|penciller=[[Don Kramer]]|story=Face the Face – Conclusion|title=[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]|issue=654|date=August, 2006|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The follow-up story arc in ''Batman'', ''[[Batman &amp; Son]]'', introduces [[Damian Wayne]], who is Batman's son with [[Talia al Ghul]]. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new ''Justice League of America'' series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Brad Meltzer]]|penciller=[[Ed Benes]]|story=The Tornado's Path|title=[[Justice League|Justice League of America]] (vol. 2)|issue=1|date=August, 2006|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is leading the newest incarnation of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Chuck Dixon]]|penciller=Julian Lopex|title=[[Outsiders (comics)|Batman and the Outsiders (vol. 2)]]|issue=1|date=November, 2007|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grant Morrison]]'s 2008 storyline, ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'', featuring Batman being physically and mentally broken by the enigmatic &quot;Black Glove,&quot; garnered much news coverage in advance of its highly promoted conclusion, which would supposedly feature the death of Bruce Wayne.&lt;ref name=&quot;SUN&quot;&gt;Rothstein, Simon. &quot;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/article1982939.ece Batman killed by his OWN dad].&quot; 28 November 2008.

[http://www.webcitation.org/5cfcFZA9F Archived] 28 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The original intention was, in fact, not for Batman to die in the pages of &quot;R.I.P.,&quot; but for the story to continue with the current DC event ''[[Final Crisis]]'' and have the death occur there. As such, a two-issue bridge arc was designed called &quot;Last Rites&quot; that showed Batman survive his helicopter crash into the Gotham City River and return to the Batcave, only to be summoned to the Hall of Justice by the JLA to help investigate Orion's death. This in turn led into the events of &quot;Final Crisis&quot; (which began publication during the conclusion of &quot;Batman RIP&quot;), where Batman is kidnapped by [[Granny Goodness]]. &quot;Last Rites&quot; told the tale of Batman being mentally probed by [[Darkseid]]'s minions Mokkari and Simyon, in an attempt to cull the personality traits that make Batman the successful superhero that he is in order to transplant them into cloned bodies. The plan fails due to the clones, unable to handle the stress and grief Batman processes on a daily basis choose to kill themselves rather than endure such a tortured existence. The two-parter concludes with a major &quot;Final Crisis&quot; plot point, as it is revealed that Batman kept the bullet used to kill Orion in his utility belt.&lt;ref name=&quot;deadatlast&quot;&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/010915-Batman-RIP-Finally.html Newsarama: &quot;Batman R.I.P. - Finally?&quot;] 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Batman's apparent death occurs in ''Final Crisis'' #6 when he confronts Darkseid. Batman announces that he will break his &quot;no gun&quot; rule while facing the villain. Wielding a sidearm made by [[Apokolips]], Batman shoots Darkseid in the chest with a bullet made of Radion (the same bullet used to kill Orion), just as Darkseid unleashes his [[Omega Sanction]], or the &quot;death that is life&quot;, upon Batman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Grant Morrison]]|penciller=[[J.G.

Although the presence of Batman's corpse would suggest that he is dead, at the conclusion of ''Final Crisis'' it is revealed that Batman has been sent to the distant past where he is able to watch the passing of [[Anthro (comics)|Anthro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Grant Morrison]]|title=Final Crisis #7|date=January 2009|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grant Morrison: Final Crisis Exit Interview, Part 2|url=http://newsarama.com/comics/020904-Grant-FC2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-issue ''[[Battle for the Cowl]]'' miniseries, ('cowl' referring to Batman's mask) sees those closest to Wayne compete for the &quot;right&quot; to assume the role of Batman. Eventually, Grayson reluctantly assumes the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Tony Daniel]]|title=Battle for the Cowl #3|date=May 2009|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Drake takes on the identity of [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]], questing around the world searching for Bruce Wayne, who he believes is still alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Chris Yost]]|title=Red Robin #1|date=August 2009|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Blackest Night]]'', the villain [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]] is seen digging up Bruce Wayne's body, stealing his skull, and recruiting it into the [[Black Lantern Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns]]|title=Blackest Night #0|date=June 2009|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deadman]], whose body has also become a Black Lantern, rushes to aid the new Batman and Robin, along with Red Robin against the Gotham villains who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns, as well as their own family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Peter J. Tomasi]]|title=Blackest Night: Batman #1|date=October 2009|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skull was briefly reanimated as a Black Lantern, reconstructing a body in the process by Black Hand's lord, [[Nekron]], to move against the Justice League and the Titans. After the Black Lantern Batman created several black power rings to attach to and kill the majority of the Justice League, the skull was returned to normal after Nekron explained it served its purpose as an emotional tether. Nekron also referred to the skull as &quot;Bruce Wayne&quot;, knowing that the body was not authentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns]]|title=Blackest Night #5|date=January 2010|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]'''s third storyline, &quot;Blackest Knight,&quot; it is revealed that the body left behind at the end of ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #6 was actually a clone created from a failed attempt by Darkseid to amass an army of &quot;Batmen&quot;. Because of this, the skull that was used by the Black Lantern Corps and reanimated by Nekron was a fake. Dick Grayson, thinking it was Bruce Wayne's real body, attempted to resurrect it in a [[Lazarus Pit]] only to be met with a fierce, mindless combatant. He then realized the truth about the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Grant Morrison]]|title=[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]'' #7|date=January 2010|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Grant Morrison]]|title=[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]'' #8|date=February 2010|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrison's storyline continues with the miniseries ''[[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne]]''. In the miniseries, Bruce travels through time from the [[prehistory|prehistoric]] era back to present-day Gotham.  However, the Dark Knight must overcome unforeseen obstacles: unbeknownst to the hero, Darkseid turned him into a living doomsday weapon when he sent him back in time, which forces Batman's allies to stop him.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Geddes |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/2009-12-09-morrison-bruce-wayne-st_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip |title=Grant Morrison on return of original Batman |work=[[USA Today]] |date=December 9, 2009 |accessdate=December 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Source&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Alex |last=Segura |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2009/12/09/dcu-in-2010-the-return-of-bruce-wayne-hits-in-april/ |title=DCU in 2010: The Return of Bruce Wayne hits in April |work=The Source |publisher=DC Comics.com |date=December 9, 2009 |accessdate=December 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SourceBatmanMay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2010/02/11/take-an-early-look-at-batman-titles-for-may/#more-7397 |title=Batman solicitations for May 2010 at DC's The Source |publisher=Dcu.blog.dccomics.com |date=2010-02-11 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to his allies, Batman is able to foil Darkseid's final plan and return to the present.

After Bruce's return, he returns to his role as the Dark Knight on a global scale, thus allowing Dick and Damian to continue as Gotham's Dynamic Duo. This is seen in the new ongoing series ''[[Batman, Inc.]]'', where Batman will form an army of heroes that will serve as the Batman on every country of the world. To this end, Bruce publicly announces that Wayne Enterprises will aid Batman on his mission, known as &quot;Batman, Incorporated.&quot; Also, Batman will be the protagonist in the new title ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]'', which will be written and drawn by [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]]. This new title will also see Batman remaining in Gotham to investigate about the disappearance of his friend Dawn Golden. This new title will see Batman investigating themes about mysticism and magic.

==Characterization==
Batman's primary character traits can be summarized as &quot;wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and obsession.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pearson pg 186&quot; /&gt; The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years due to different creative teams. Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: &quot;[[Julius Schwartz|Julie Schwartz]] did a Batman in ''Batman'' and ''Detective'' and [[Murray Boltinoff]] did a Batman in the ''Brave and the Bold'' and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not coordinate their efforts, did not pretend to, did not want to, were not asked to. Continuity was not important in those days.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson; Uricchio. &quot;Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil&quot; p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The driving force behind Batman's character is from his childhood. Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman's background and decided that &quot;there's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his trauma, he is driven to train to become a brilliant scientist&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;DETECTIVE Comics #33, November 1939, Bill Finger, Bob Kane&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;BATMAN #1 Spring 1940,Bill Finger, Bob Kane&lt;/ref&gt; and train his body into absolute physical perfection&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; to fight crime in [[Gotham City]] as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Another of Batman's characterizations is a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents, he must sometimes break laws himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by different artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman's origin have never varied at all in the comic books, the &quot;reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, pg. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The origin is the source of the character's traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character's adventures.&lt;ref name=&quot;pearson pg 186&quot; /&gt;

Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories. Frank Miller views the character as &quot;a [[Dionysus|dionysian]] figure, a force for [[anarchy]] that imposes an individual order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sharrett, Christopher. &quot;Batman and the Twilight of the Idols: An Interview with Frank Miller.&quot; ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. ISBN 0-85170-276-7, pg. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Dressed as a bat, Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime-fighting,&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, pg. 208&lt;/ref&gt; a fear that originates from the criminals' own guilty [[conscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennis O'Neil, Wizard Batman Special 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bruce Wayne===
In his secret identity, Batman is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy businessman who lives in Gotham City. To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is often seen as an irresponsible, superficial playboy who lives off his family's personal fortune (amassed when his family invested in Gotham real estate before the city was a bustling metropolis)&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis O'Neil]] ''Batman: Knightfall''. 1994, [[Bantam Books]]. ISBN 0-553-09673-7&lt;/ref&gt; and the profits of [[Wayne Enterprises]], a major private technology firm that he inherits. However, Wayne is also known for his contributions to charity, notably through his Wayne Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, pg. 202&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce creates the playboy public persona to aid in throwing off suspicion of his secret identity, often acting dim-witted and self-absorbed to further the act.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, 1999, pg. ??&lt;/ref&gt; Among the more noted measures he uses to maintain the facade is pretending he is a heavy drinker by claiming his glasses of [[ginger ale]] are strong beverages; Bruce is actually a strict [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]] to maintain his physical fitness and mental acuity.

Writers of both Batman and Superman stories have often compared the two within the context of various stories, to varying conclusions. Like Superman, the prominent persona of Batman's dual identities varies with time. Modern age comics have tended to portray &quot;Bruce Wayne&quot; as the facade, with &quot;Batman&quot; as the truer representation of his personality&lt;ref&gt;Scott Beatty, ''The Batman Handbook: The Ultimate Training Manual''. 2005, Quirk Books, p51. ISBN 1-59474-023-2&lt;/ref&gt; (in counterpoint to the post-Crisis Superman, whose &quot;[[Clark Kent]]&quot; persona is the 'real' personality, and &quot;Superman&quot; is the 'mask').&lt;ref&gt;Aichele, G. (1997). ''Rewriting Superman.'' In G. Aichele &amp; T. Pippin (Eds.), ''The Monstrous and the Unspeakable: The Bible as Fantastic Literature'' (pp. 75-101). Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' vol. 2, #53&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Batman Unmasked'', a television documentary about the psychology of the character, Associate Professor of Social Psychology at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and an adjunct [[behavioral science|behavioral scientist]] at the [[Rand Corporation]] [[Benjamin Karney]], notes that Batman's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's inherent humanity; that &quot;Batman, for all its benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it, is ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne's efforts to make the world better&quot;.

As noted in the Will Brooker book, ''Batman Unmasked'', &quot;the confirmation of Batman's identity lies with the young audience...he doesn't have to be Bruce Wayne; he just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and most importantly the morality, the humanity. There's just a sense about him: 'they trust him... and they're never wrong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Batman Unmasked |last=Brooker |first=Will |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=NY/London |isbn= 0-8264-1343-9 |page=368 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=GNRreYO91ogC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Unmasking+Batman |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finger came up with the name &quot;Bruce Wayne&quot; for the superhero's secret identity. In Jim Steranko's History of the Comics, vol. 1, Bill Finger reveals, &quot;Bruce Wayne's first name came from [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]], the Scottish patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock...then I thought of [[Anthony Wayne|Mad Anthony Wayne]].&quot; 

To the world at large, Bruce Wayne is seen as an irresponsible, superficial playboy who lives off his family's personal fortune and the major private technology firm that he inherits. Bruce creates the public persona to aid in throwing off suspicion of his secret identity, often acting dim-witted and self-absorbed to further the act. Batman makes it clear that he considers keeping his secret identity a top priority; on various occasions, he often risks death rather than exposing his skills in public as Bruce Wayne. However, Wayne is also known for his contributions to charity, notably through the Wayne Foundation, a charity devoted to helping the victims of crime and preventing people from becoming criminals.

In T. James Musler's book ''Unleashing the Superhero in Us All'', he explores the extent to which money is important in Bruce Wayne's life.&lt;ref&gt;T. James Musler. 2006. ''Unleashing the Superhero in Us All''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dick Grayson===
{{Main|Dick Grayson}}
While Wayne traveled through time to get back to the present, [[Dick Grayson]] became the new Batman. This was the second time he had taken on the mantle in Bruce Wayne's absence, albeit the first time (when Wayne was recovering from his broken back) reluctantly. After Wayne's &quot;death&quot;, Dick stated that he had no problem becoming Batman, but Wayne had left a prerecorded message telling him not to take up the mantle and to continue fighting crime as Nightwing with Robin at his side. Realizing that Gotham still needed the Dark Knight, Dick retired his Nightwing mantle to become the new Batman. With Wayne's return and plans to launch Batman worldwide, Dick will continue to be the Batman of Gotham City.

In an interview with [[IGN]], Morrison details that having Grayson as Batman and [[Damian Wayne]] as Robin will be a &quot;reverse&quot; of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, &quot;a more light-hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling, badass Robin.&quot; Morrison explains his intentions for the new characterization of Batman: &quot;Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman's partner since he was a kid, he's led the [[Teen Titans]], and he's trained with everybody in the DC Universe. So he's a very different kind of Batman. He's a lot easier; {{sic|hide=y|He's}} a lot looser and more relaxed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;comics.ign.com&quot;/&gt;

==Skills, abilities, and resources==
There are a plethora of superheroes without superpowers, but of them all the Batman character relies on &quot;his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Wright_p17&quot;/&gt; In the stories Batman is regarded as one of the world's greatest detectives.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Conray, ''500 Great Comicbook Action Heroes''. 2002, Collins &amp; Brown. ISBN 1-84411-004-4&lt;/ref&gt; In Grant Morrison's first storyline in ''JLA'', Superman describes Batman as &quot;the most dangerous man on Earth,&quot; able to defeat a team of superpowered aliens by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Grant Morrison]]|penciller=[[Howard Porter]]|story=War of the Worlds|title=JLA|issue=3|date=March, 1997|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a master of disguise, often gathering information under the identity of Matches Malone, a notorious gangster. Additionally, the Batman has been repeatedly described as one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, having either trained with or fought against the very best of them including such notables as [[Lady Shiva]], [[Bronze Tiger]], and [[Richard Dragon]].

===Costume===
{{Main|Batsuit}}
Batman's costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals.&lt;ref name=&quot;A1&quot;&gt;Daniels (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various stories and media, but the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape, a cowl covering most of the face featuring a pair of batlike ears, and a stylized bat emblem on the chest, and the ever-present utility belt. The costumes' colors are traditionally blue and grey,&lt;ref name=&quot;A1&quot; /&gt; although this colorization arose due to the way comic book art is colored.&lt;ref name=&quot;A1&quot; /&gt; Finger and Kane conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue.&lt;ref name=&quot;A1&quot; /&gt; This coloring has been claimed by Larry Ford, in ''Place, Power, Situation, and Spectacle: A Geography of Film'', to be a reversion of conventional color-coding symbolism, which sees &quot;bad guys&quot; wearing dark colors.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Ford, &quot;Lighting and Color in the Depiction&quot; in ''Place, Power, Situation, and Spectacle: A Geography of Film'', Stuart C. Aitken, Leo Zonn, Leo E. Zonn eds. 1994 Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p132. ISBN 0-8476-7826-1&lt;/ref&gt; Batman's gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the scallops. A yellow ellipse around the bat logo on the character's chest was added in 1964, and became the hero's trademark symbol, akin to the red and yellow &quot;S&quot; symbol of Superman.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt; The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl's ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O'Neil said, &quot;We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don't have to look the same . . . Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to put their own spin on it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 159–60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equipment===
{{See also|Batman's utility belt}}
[[File:USD205998.png|thumb|The 1966 television Batmobile was built by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] from a [[Lincoln Futura]] [[concept car]].]]
Batman uses a large arsenal of specialized gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian [[Les Daniels]] credits [[Gardner Fox]] with creating the concept of Batman's arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in ''Detective Comics'' #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the [[batarang]] and the &quot;Batgyro&quot; in ''Detective Comics'' #31 and #32 (September; October, 1939).&lt;ref name = &quot;vapzdg&quot;/&gt; Batman's primary vehicle is the [[Batmobile]], which is usually depicted as an imposing black car with large [[tailfin]]s that suggest a bat's wings. Batman's other vehicles include the [[Batplane]] (aka the Batwing), [[Batboat]], [[Bat-Sub]], and [[Batcycle]].

In proper practice, the &quot;bat&quot; prefix (as in batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' live-action television show]] and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' animated series) stretched the practice to [[Camp (style)|campy]] proportions. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such &quot;bat-&quot; names as the bat-computer, bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-[[shark repellent]] bat-spray, and bat-rope. The storyline &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; suggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the &quot;bat&quot; prefix on his own.

Batman keeps most of his field equipment in a utility belt. Over the years it is shown to contain a virtually limitless variety of crime-fighting tools. Different versions of the belt have these items stored in either pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it. A typical major exception to the range of Batman's equipment are conventional [[firearm]]s, which he refuses to use on principle considering that weapon class was the instrument of his parents' murder. Modern depictions of Batman have him compromise for practicality by arming his vehicles mainly for the purpose of removing obstacles or disabling enemy vehicles.

===Bat-Signal===
{{Main|Bat-Signal}}
When Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a [[searchlight]] with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat-Signal which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.

In various incarnations, most notably the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' TV series]], Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent cake cover on top. The line connects directly to Batman's residence, [[Wayne Manor]], specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne's study and the extension phone in the Batcave.

===Batcave===
{{Main|Batcave}}
The Batcave is Batman's secret headquarters, consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his mansion, Wayne Manor. It serves as his command center for both local and global surveillance, as well as housing his vehicles and equipment for his war on crime. It also is a storeroom for Batman's memorabilia. In both the comic ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' (issue #45) and the 2005 film ''[[Batman Begins]]'', the cave is said to have been part of the [[Underground Railroad]]. Of the heroes and villains who see the Batcave, few know where it is located.

==Supporting characters==
{{Main|List of Batman supporting characters}}
[[File:BatmanRobin.jpg|thumb|Batman with his [[sidekick]] [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Painting by [[Alex Ross]], based on the cover of ''Batman'' #9 by [[Jack Burnley]].]]
Batman's interactions with the characters around him, both heroes and villains, help to define the character.&lt;ref name=&quot;pearson pg 186&quot; /&gt; [[Chief of police|Commissioner]] [[James Gordon (comics)|James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon]], Batman's ally in the Gotham City police, debuted along with Batman in ''Detective Comics'' #27 and has been a consistent presence since then. Later on, Batman gained Alfred as his butler and [[Lucius Fox]] as his business manager and apparently unwitting [[armorer]]. However, the most important supporting role in the Batman mythos is filled by the hero's young sidekick Robin.&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The first Robin, Dick Grayson, eventually leaves his mentor and becomes the hero Nightwing, though he and Batman would still continue to work together. The second Robin, [[Jason Todd]], is badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker, but later returns as an adversary. [[Tim Drake]], the third Robin, first appeared in 1989 and went on to star in his own comic series. Alfred, Bruce Wayne's loyal butler, father figure, and one of the few to know his secret identity, &quot;[lends] a homey touch to Batman's environs and [is] ever ready to provide a steadying and reassuring hand&quot; to the hero and his sidekick.&lt;ref name = &quot;Boichel_p8&quot;&gt;Boichel, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Batman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the Justice League of America and the Outsiders. Batman has often been paired in adventure with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the co-stars of ''World's Finest'' and ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series. In pre-Crisis continuity, the two are depicted as close friends; however, in current continuity, they have a mutually respectful but uneasy relationship, with an emphasis on their differing views on crime-fighting and justice. In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #3 (December 2003), [[Superman]] observes, &quot;Sometimes, I admit, I think of Bruce as a man in a costume. Then, with some gadget from his utility belt, he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind. And how lucky I am to be able to call on him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| Writer = [[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]] | Penciller = [[Ed McGuinness|McGuinness, Ed]] | Inker = [[Dexter Vines|Vines, Dexter]] | Title = [[Superman/Batman]] | Volume =1 | Story = Running Wild | Issue = 3 | Date = December 2003 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batman is involved romantically with many women throughout his various incarnations. These range from society women such as [[Julie Madison]], [[Vicki Vale]], and [[Silver St. Cloud]], to allies like [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Sasha Bordeaux]], to even villainesses such as [[Catwoman]] and [[Talia al Ghul]], with the latter of whom he sired a son, Damian, and with the former of whom sired a daughter, Helena (on Earth-Two). While these relationships tend to be short, Batman's attraction to Catwoman is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear. Authors have gone back and forth over the years as to how Batman manages the 'playboy' aspect of Bruce Wayne's personality; at different times he embraces or flees from the women interested in attracting &quot;Gotham's most eligible bachelor.&quot;

Other supporting characters in Batman's world include former Batgirl [[Barbara Gordon]], Commissioner Gordon's daughter who, now using a wheelchair due to a gunshot wound inflicted by the Joker, serves the superhero community at large as the [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] Oracle; Azrael, a would-be assassin who replaces Bruce Wayne as Batman for a time; [[Cassandra Cain]], an assassin's daughter who became the new Batgirl, [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]], the sole surviving member of a mob family turned Gotham vigilante who has worked with Batman on occasion, [[Spoiler (comics)|Stephanie Brown]], the daughter of a criminal who operated as the Spoiler and temporarily as Robin, Ace the Bat-Hound, Batman's Canine partner;&lt;ref name=&quot;138D&quot;&gt;Daniels (1995), pg. 138&lt;/ref&gt; and Bat-Mite, an extra-dimensional imp who idolizes Batman.&lt;ref name=&quot;138D&quot; /&gt;

===Enemies===
[[File:Batmanfoes.jpg|thumb|A gathering of Batman's villains. Art by [[Jim Lee]].]]
{{Main|List of Batman enemies}}
Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. The list is one of the most recognizable in popular culture{{cite}}, many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime.&lt;ref name = &quot;Boichel_p8&quot;/&gt; Batman's &quot;most implacable foe&quot; is the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], a [[psychopath]]ic, clown-like criminal who, as a &quot;personification of the irrational&quot;, represents &quot;everything Batman [opposes].&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Boichel_p9&quot;/&gt; Other long time recurring antagonists include [[Catwoman]], the [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]], the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], [[Two-Face]], the [[Riddler]], [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], and [[Ra's al Ghul]], among many others.

==Cultural impact==
Batman has become a pop culture icon, recognized around the world. The character's presence has extended beyond his comic book origins; events such as the release of the 1989 ''Batman'' film and its accompanying merchandising &quot;brought the Batman to the forefront of public consciousness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;introduction&quot; /&gt; In an article commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the character, ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, &quot;Batman is a figure blurred by the endless reinvention that is modern mass culture. He is at once an icon and a commodity: the perfect cultural &lt;!-- IMPORTANT: Please do not amend the spelling of the following word, it is a direct quotation from a UK publication and is the correct spelling for that location.

===In other media===
{{Main|Batman franchise media}}
The character of Batman has appeared in various media aside from comic books. The character has been developed as a vehicle for [[newspaper]] syndicated [[comic strip]]s, [[book]]s, [[radio drama]]s, [[television]], and several theatrical [[feature film]]s. The first adaptation of Batman was as a daily newspaper [[comic strip]] which premiered on October 25, 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 50&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the character was adapted in the 15-part [[Serial film|serial]] ''[[Batman (serial)|Batman]]'', with [[Lewis Wilson]] becoming the first actor to portray Batman on screen. While Batman never had a [[radio]] series of his own, the character made occasional guest appearance in ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' starting in 1945 on occasions when Superman voice actor [[Bud Collyer]] needed time off.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dan99p64&quot;&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt; A second movie serial, ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'', followed in 1949, with [[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]] taking over the role of Batman. The exposure provided by these adaptations during the 1940s &quot;helped make [Batman] a household name for millions who never bought a comic book.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dan99p64&quot;/&gt;

In the 1964 publication of [[Donald Barthelme]]'s collection of short stories &quot;Come Back, Dr. Caligari&quot;, Barthelme wrote &quot;The Joker's Greatest Triumph.&quot; Batman is portrayed for purposes of spoof as a pretentious French-speaking rich man.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Lance. &quot;Linguistic Pratfalls in Barthelme&quot;, ''[[South Atlantic Review]]'' 5.4 (1986), pp. 69-77.

[[File:Batman keaton 89.jpg|left|thumb|[[Michael Keaton]] as Batman in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989)]]
The ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, starring [[Adam West]], premiered in January 1966 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network. Inflected with a [[Camp (style)|camp]] sense of humor, the show became a pop culture phenomenon. In his memoir, ''Back to the Batcave'', West notes his dislike for the term 'camp' as it was applied to the 1960s series, opining that the show was instead a [[farce]] or [[Parody|lampoon]], and a deliberate one, at that. The series ran for 120 episodes, ending in 1968. In between the first and second season of the ''Batman'' television series the cast and crew made the theatrical release ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' (1966). [[The Kinks]] performed the theme song from the Batman series on their 1967 album [[Live at Kelvin Hall]]. The popularity of the ''Batman'' TV series also resulted in the first animated adaptation of Batman in the series ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, pg. 14&lt;/ref&gt; the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as ''[[The Adventures of Batman]]'' and ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'' which produced thirty-three episodes between 1968 and 1977. From 1973 until 1986, Batman had a starring role in ABC's ''[[Super Friends]]'' series, which was animated by [[Hanna-Barbera]]. [[Olan Soule]] was the voice of Batman in all these series, but was eventually replaced during ''Super Friends'' by Adam West, who voiced the character in [[Filmation]]'s 1977 series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''.

In 1989, Batman returned to movie theaters in director [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' starring [[Michael Keaton]] as the title character. The film was a huge success; not only was it the top-grossing film of the year, but at the time was the fifth highest-grossing film in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batman.htm | title= Batman (1989) | publisher=BoxOfficeMojo.com | accessdate=2007-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film spawned three sequels: ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995), and ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' (1997), the latter two of which were directed by [[Joel Schumacher]] instead of Burton, and replaced Keaton as Batman with [[Val Kilmer]] and [[George Clooney]], respectively. The second Schumacher film, while a box office success, failed to outgross any of its predecessors and was critically panned, causing [[Warner Bros.]] to cancel the planned fifth film, ''Batman Triumphant'', and place the film series on hiatus.

In 1992, Batman returned to television in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', which was produced by [[Warner Bros.]] and broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television network. Author [[Les Daniels]] described the series as &quot;[coming] as close as any artistic statement has to defining the look of Batman for the 1990s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pg. 178&lt;/ref&gt; The success of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' led to the animated spin-off film ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'' (1993), as well as various other animated series set in the [[DC animated universe|same continuity]], including ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', and ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''. As with ''Batman: The Animated Series'', each of these productions featured [[Kevin Conroy]] as the voice of Batman. In 2004, a new animated series titled ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' made its debut with [[Rino Romano]] as the title character. In 2008, this show was replaced by another animated series, ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', with [[Diedrich Bader]] as Batman.

In 2005, ''[[Batman Begins]]'', a reboot of the film series, was released, directed by [[Christopher Nolan]] and starring [[Christian Bale]] as Batman. Its sequel, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (2008), set the record for the highest grossing opening weekend of all time in the U.S., earning approximately $158 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/ | title= Opening Weekends | publisher=BoxOfficeMojo.com | accessdate=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the fastest film to reach the $400 million mark in the history of American cinema (eighteenth day of release).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/fastest.htm?page=400&amp;p=.htm | title= Fastest to $400 million | publisher=BoxOfficeMojo.com | accessdate=2008-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These record breaking attendances saw ''The Dark Knight'' listed as the third-highest domestic grossing film of all time with $533 million, bested only by ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic.htm | title= All Time Domestic Box Office Results | publisher=BoxOfficeMojo.com | accessdate=2008-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An animated anthology feature set between the Nolan films, ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', was also released in 2008.

===Homosexual interpretations===
{{See|Homosexuality in the Batman franchise}}
[[File:Batbed.png|thumb|300px|Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson. Panel from ''Batman'' #84 (June 1954), page 24.]]

Controversy has arisen over various sexual interpretations made regarding the content of Batman comics in the early decades. [[Homosexuality|Homosexual]] interpretations have been part of the academic study of Batman since psychologist [[Fredric Wertham]] asserted in his ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' in 1954 that &quot;Batman stories are psychologically homosexual.&quot; He claimed, &quot;The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual [[sexual fantasy|fantasies]], of the nature of which they may be unconscious.&quot; Wertham wrote, &quot;Only someone ignorant of the fundamentals of psychiatry and of the [[psychopathology]] of sex can fail to realize a subtle atmosphere of [[homoeroticism]] which pervades the adventures of the mature 'Batman' and his young friend 'Robin.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wertham, Fredric. ''Seduction of the Innocent''. Rinehart and Company, Inc., 1954. pg. 189–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Andy Medhurst wrote in his 1991 essay &quot;Batman, Deviance, and Camp&quot; that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because &quot;he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality,&quot; &quot;the 1960s TV series remains a touchstone of camp,&quot; and &quot;[he] merits analysis as a notably successful construction of masculinity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Medhurst, Andy. &quot;Batman, Deviance, and Camp.&quot; ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. ISBN 0-85170-276-7, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

Creators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions. Writer Alan Grant has stated, &quot;The Batman I wrote for 13 years isn't gay. Denny O'Neil's Batman, [[Marv Wolfman]]'s Batman, everybody's Batman all the way back to Bob Kane... none of them wrote him as a gay character. Only Joel Schumacher might have had an opposing view.&quot; Writer [[Devin Grayson]] has commented, &quot;It depends who you ask, doesn't it? Since you're asking me, I'll say no, I don't think he is ... I certainly understand the gay readings, though.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is Batman Gay? |work= |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/panel/106070953757230.htm |accessdate=December 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Frank Miller has described the relationship between Batman and the Joker as a &quot;[[homophobia|homophobic]] nightmare,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sharrett, pg. 37-38&lt;/ref&gt; he views the character as [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimating]] his sexual urges into crimefighting, concluding, &quot;He'd be ''much'' healthier if he were gay.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sharrett, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burt Ward]], who portrayed Robin in the 1960s television show, has also remarked upon this interpretation in his autobiography ''Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights''; he writes that the relationship could be interpreted as a sexual one, with the show's [[double entendre]]s and lavish camp also possibly offering ambiguous interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bruce Wayne: Bachelor |work=Ninth Art: Andrew Wheeler Comment |url=http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=963 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050428003852/http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=963 |archivedate=2005-04-28 |accessdate=June 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such homosexual interpretations continue to attract attention. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics refused to allow permission for the reprinting of four panels (from ''Batman'' #79, 92, 105 and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper ''All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beatty |first=Bart |title=Don't Ask, Don't Tell: How Do You Illustrate an Academic Essay about Batman and Homosexuality? |journal=The Comics Journal |year=2000 |volume= |issue=228 |pages=17–18 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another happened in the summer of 2005, when painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of [[watercolor]]s depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mark Chamberlain (American, 1967) |publisher=Artnet |url=http://www.artnet.com/Galleries/Artists_detail.asp?G=&amp;gid=423822183&amp;which=&amp;aid=424157172&amp;ViewArtistBy=online&amp;rta=http://www.artnet.com/ag/fulltextsearch.asp?searchstring=Mark+Chamberlain}}&lt;/ref&gt; DC threatened both artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action if they did not cease selling the works and demanded all remaining art, as well as any profits derived from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gallery told to drop 'gay' Batman |date=August 19, 2005 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4167032.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boston Red Sox''' are a [[professional baseball|professional baseball team]] based in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and a member of the [[Major League Baseball]]’s [[American League East|American League Eastern Division]]. Founded in {{by|1901}} as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox's home [[baseball park|ballpark]] has been [[Fenway Park]] since {{by|1912}}.  The &quot;Red Sox&quot; name was chosen by the team owner, [[John I. Taylor]], around {{by|1908}}, following previous Boston teams that had been known as the &quot;[[Atlanta Braves|Red Stockings]]&quot;.

Boston was a dominant team in the new league, defeating the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the first [[World Series]] in {{by|1903}} and winning four more championships by {{by|1918}}.  However, they then went into one of the longest championship [[List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts|droughts]] in baseball history, called by some the &quot;[[Curse of the Bambino]]&quot; after its alleged beginning with the Red Sox's sale of [[Babe Ruth]] to the rival Yankees in 1918, an 86-year wait before the team's sixth World Championship in {{wsy|2004}}. However, the team's history during that period was hardly one of futility, but was rather punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history, including [[Enos Slaughter]]'s &quot;[[1946 Boston Red Sox season|mad dash]]&quot; in {{wsy|1946}}, the &quot;[[The Impossible Dream (1967)|Impossible Dream]]&quot; of {{wsy|1967}}, [[Carlton Fisk]]'s home run in {{wsy|1975}}, and [[Bill Buckner]]'s error in {{wsy|1986}}.  Red Sox history has also been marked by the team's intense [[Yankees – Red Sox rivalry|rivalry]] with the [[New York Yankees]], arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;1918!&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=ReverseCurse/&gt;&lt;ref name=UltimateRivalry/&gt; Since {{by|2003}}, the Red Sox have been perennial playoff contenders and have won two World Series, emerging as one of the most successful MLB teams of the last decade.

The Red Sox are consistently one of the top MLB teams in average road attendance, while the small capacity of Fenway Park prevents them from leading in overall attendance.&lt;ref name=Attendance&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/attendance?sort=home_avg&amp;year=2007&amp;seasonType=2 |title=MLB Attendance Report – 2007 |author=MLB document |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=November 1, 2007 |accessdate=November 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every home game since May 15, 2003 has been sold out—an MLB record that has spanned almost eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Golen|first=Jimmy |url= http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2007-05-15-261793538_x.htm |title= Tigers 7, Red Sox 2 |newspaper=USA Today |date=May 15, 2007 | accessdate=October 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url = http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ycn-8166895 | title = Top five most loyal MLB fan bases | accessdate = 2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nickname==
The name ''Red Sox'', chosen by owner [[John I. Taylor]] after the 1907 season, refers to the red hose in the team uniform beginning {{by|1908}}.  ''Sox'' had been previously adopted for the [[Chicago White Sox]] by newspapers needing a headline-friendly form of ''Stockings'', as &quot;Stockings Win!&quot; in [[Large font|large type]] would not fit on a page. The [[Spanish language]] media sometime refers to the team as ''Medias Rojas'' for Red Socks.

The nickname was first used for a baseball team by the [[Cincinnati Reds|Cincinnati Red Stockings]], who were members of the pioneering [[National Association of Base Ball Players]]. Managed by [[Harry Wright]], Cincinnati adopted a uniform with white knickers and red stockings, and earned the famous nickname, a year or two before hiring the first fully professional team in 1869. When the club folded after the 1870 season, Wright was hired to organize a new team in Boston, and he did, bringing three teammates and the &quot;Red Stockings&quot; nickname along (Most nicknames were then only nicknames, neither club names nor registered trademarks, so the migration was informal). The [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] won four championships in the five seasons of the new [[National Association of Baseball Players|National Association]], the first professional league.

When a new Cincinnati club was formed as a charter member of the [[National League]] in 1876, the &quot;Red Stockings&quot; nickname was commonly reserved for them once again, and the Boston team was referred to as the &quot;Red Caps&quot;. Other names were sometimes used before Boston officially adopted the nickname &quot;Braves&quot; in {{by|1912}}; the club [[Atlanta Braves#Milwaukee (1953–1965)|eventually left Boston for Milwaukee]] and is now playing in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]].

[[File:BostonRedSox1908logo.svg|thumb|left|200px|The Red Sox logo worn on uniforms in 1908, announcing the team's first official nickname]]In {{by|1901}}, the upstart [[American League]] established a competing club in Boston. (Originally, a team was supposed to be started in Buffalo, but league ownership at the last minute removed the city from their plans in favor of the expansion Boston franchise.) For seven seasons, the AL team wore ''dark blue'' stockings and had no official nickname. They were simply &quot;Boston&quot;, &quot;Bostonians&quot; or &quot;the Bostons&quot;; or the &quot;Americans&quot; or &quot;Boston Americans&quot; as in &quot;American Leaguers&quot;, Boston being a two-team city. Their 1901–1907 jerseys, both home and road, simply read &quot;Boston&quot;, except for 1902 when they sported large letters &quot;B&quot; and &quot;A&quot; denoting &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;American.&quot; Newspaper writers of the time used other nicknames for the club, including &quot;Somersets&quot; (for owner [[Charles Somers]]), &quot;Plymouth Rocks,&quot; &quot;Beaneaters,&quot; the &quot;Collinsites&quot; (for manager [[Jimmy Collins]])&quot;, and &quot;Pilgrims.&quot;

For years many sources have listed &quot;Pilgrims&quot; as the early Boston AL team's ''official'' nickname, but researcher Bill Nowlin has demonstrated that the name was barely used, if at all, during the team's early years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/boston_pilgrims_story.shtml Nowlin's followup article in the ''The National Pastime''. Apparently this originated with a writer for the ''[[Washington Post]]'' during 1906, and by 1907 it started to be retroactively applied to the 1903 club, even by Boston newspapers.]&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the nickname appears to be a poem entitled “The Pilgrims At Home” written by Edwin Fitzwilliam that was sung at the 1907 home opener (“Rory O’More” melody).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebrateboston.com/sports/baseball/bostonpilgrims.htm “The Boston Pilgrims Did Exist”]&lt;/ref&gt; This nickname was commonly used during that season, perhaps because the team had a new manager and several rookie players. [[John I. Taylor]] had said in December 1907 that the Pilgrims “sounded too much like homeless wanderers.”

The National League club in Boston, though seldom called the &quot;Red Stockings&quot; anymore, still wore red trim. In {{by|1907}}, the National League club adopted an all-white uniform, and the American League team saw an opportunity. On December 18, 1907, Taylor announced that the club had officially adopted red as its new team color. The 1908 uniforms featured a large icon of a red stocking angling across the shirt front. For 1908, the National League club returned to wearing red trim, but the American League team finally had an official nickname, and would remain the &quot;Red Sox&quot; for good.

The name is often [[List of baseball nicknames|shortened]] to &quot;Bosox&quot; or &quot;BoSox,&quot; a combination of &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Sox&quot; (similar to the [[Chicago White Sox|&quot;ChiSox&quot;]] in Chicago or the minor league [[Pawtucket Red Sox|&quot;PawSox&quot;]] of Pawtucket). Sportswriters sometimes refer to the Red Sox as the ''Crimson Hose''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.courant.com/colin_mcenroe_to_wit/2007/10/crimson-hose.html|title=Colin McEnroe at the Hartford Courant}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''the Olde Towne Team''. Recently, media has begun to casually call them the &quot;Sawx&quot;, reflecting how the word is pronounced with a [[New England English|New England accent]]. However, most fans simply refer to the team as the &quot;Sox&quot; when the context is understood to mean Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20080420&amp;content_id=2559253&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos|title=Boston Red Sox News | RedSox.com: News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Boston Red Sox}}

===1901–1919===
[[File:1901 Boston Americans.jpg|left|250px|The 1901 Boston Americans team photograph]]
In {{by|1901}}, the minor Western League, led by [[Ban Johnson]], declared its equality with the [[National League]], then the only major league in baseball. Johnson changed the name of the league to the American League, leading teams in his league to be christened with the unofficial nickname &quot;Americans&quot;. This was especially true in the case of the new Boston franchise, which would not adopt an official nickname until {{by|1908}}.

The upstart league placed franchises in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. After looking at his new league Ban Johnson decided that he would need a team in Boston to compete with the National League team there and so cancelled the Buffalo club's franchise, offering one to a new club in Boston. Playing their home games at [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]], the Boston franchise finished second and third before capturing their first pennant in 1903 and repeating the next year. Those teams were led by manager and star [[third baseman]] [[Jimmy Collins]], outfielders [[Chick Stahl]], [[Buck Freeman]] and [[Patsy Dougherty]] and [[pitcher]] [[Cy Young]], who in 1901 won the pitching [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] with 33 wins (41.8% of the team's 79 games), 1.62 ERA and 158 strikeouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/y/youngcy01.shtml |title=Cy Young Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 17, 2008 |author=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1901 to {{by|1904}} seasons rank among the best four-year runs ever.
[[File:1903 world series crowd.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Outside [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]] during the [[1903 World Series]]]]
In [[1903 Major League Baseball season|1903]], [[1903 Boston Americans season|Boston]] participated in the [[1903 World Series|first modern World Series]], beating the favored [[1903 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], winners of the NL pennant by six and a half games, winning the best-of-nine series five games to three. Aided by the modified chants of &quot;[[Tessie]]&quot; by the [[Royal Rooters]] [[fan club]] and by its stronger pitching staff, the Americans managed to overcome the odds, and win the World Series.
[[File:WorldSeries1903-640.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Iconic photo of the Huntington Avenue Grounds before the first modern World Series game]]
The [[1904 Boston Americans season|1904 club]] was almost as good as the previous team, but due to the surprise emergence of the [[1904 New York Highlanders season|New York Highlanders]], the Boston club found itself in a tight pennant race through the last games of the season. A predecessor to what would become a storied rivalry, this race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for [[Bob Unglaub]]. The climax of the season occurred on the last, dramatic doubleheader at the Highlanders’ home stadium, [[Hilltop Park]]. In order to win the pennant, the Highlanders needed to win both games. With [[Jack Chesbro]], the Highlanders' 41-game winner, on the mound, and the score tied 2–2 with a man on third in the top of the ninth, a spitball got away from Chesbro and [[Lou Criger]] scored the go-ahead run on one of the most famous wild pitches in history.
[[File:Huntington Avenue Grounds.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Huntington Avenue Grounds during a game. Note building from which the famous 1903 &quot;bird's-eye&quot; photo was taken.]]
Unfortunately, the NL champion [[1904 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] declined to play any [[1904 World Series|postseason series]], fearing it would give their New York rivals credibility (they had expected the Highlanders to win), but a sharp public reaction led the two leagues immediately to make the World Series a permanent championship, starting in {{by|1905}}.
These successful times soon ended, however, as [[1906 Boston Americans season|Boston]] lost 100 games in {{by|1906}}. However, several new star players helped the newly renamed Red Sox improve almost immediately.
[[File:Boston Americans season pass, 1906.jpg|250px|left|thumb|A season pass for the 1906 season.]]
By {{by|1909}}, legendary [[center fielder]] [[Tris Speaker]] had become a fixture in the Boston outfield, and the team worked their way to third place. However, the Red Sox would not win the pennant again until their 105-win {{by|1912}} [[1912 Major League Baseball season|season]], finishing with a club record .691 [[winning percentage]]. Anchored by an outfield considered to be among the finest in the game—Tris Speaker, [[Harry Hooper]] and [[Duffy Lewis]]—and superstar pitcher [[Smoky Joe Wood]], the Red Sox beat the New York Giants 4–3–1 in the classic [[1912 World Series]] best known for [[Snodgrass’s Muff]]. From {{by|1913}} to {{by|1916}} the Red Sox were owned by [[Joseph Lannin]], who signed [[Babe Ruth]], soon the best-known and one of the best players ever. Another 101 wins in {{by|1915}} propelled the [[1915 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] to the [[1915 World Series]], where they beat the [[1915 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] four games to one. Following the {{by|1915}} season, Tris Speaker was traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]]. His departure was more than compensated for, however, by the emergence of star pitcher Babe Ruth. The [[1916 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] went on to win the [[1916 World Series]], this time defeating the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Robins]]. In {{by|1918}}, Babe Ruth led his team to another [[1918 World Series|World Series]] championship. This time over the [[1918 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]].

====Sale of Babe Ruth====
[[Image:Babe Ruth pitching.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ruth pitching for the Red Sox in 1914, at [[Comiskey Park]] in Chicago]]
[[Harry Frazee]] bought the Red Sox from Joseph Lannin in {{by|1916}} for about $500,000. A couple of notable trades involving Harry Frazee and the Yankees occurred before the Babe Ruth sale. On December 18, 1918, outstanding outfielder [[Duffy Lewis]], pitcher [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]] (who'd posted a modern record 0.96 ERA in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/l/leonadu01.shtml |title=Dutch Leonard Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and pitcher [[Ernie Shore]] were traded to the Yankees for pitcher [[Ray Caldwell]], [[Slim Love]], [[Roxy Walters]], [[Frank Gilhooley]] and $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/L/Lewis_Duffy.stm|title=Duffy Lewis | BaseballLibrary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As all three players were well regarded in Boston&amp;nbsp;— Lewis had been a key player on the 1910s championship teams, Shore had famously relieved Babe Ruth and retired 27 straight, and Leonard had only four years before setting a modern record for earned run average&amp;nbsp;— this trade was regarded as a poor one in Boston. Then, on July 13, 1919, submarine-style pitching star [[Carl Mays]] was traded to the Yankees for Bob McGraw, Allan Russell and $40,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/M/Mays_Carl.stm|title=Carl Mays | BaseballLibrary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mays would go on to have several good years for the Yankees, but had been a discipline problem for the Red Sox.

On December 26, 1919,&lt;ref name=Frommer/&gt; Frazee sold Babe Ruth, who had played the previous six seasons for the Red Sox, to the rival New York Yankees (Ruth had just broken the single-season home run record, hitting 29 in {{by|1919}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_leagues.shtml|title=Year-by-Year League Leaders &amp; Records for Home Runs&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Legend has it that Frazee did so in order to finance the [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] play ''[[No, No, Nanette]]''. That play did not actually open on Broadway until {{by|1925}}, but as Leigh Montville discovered during research for his book, ''The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montville|first=Leigh|title=The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth|publisher=Random House|year=2006|pages=161–64|authorlink=Leigh Montville}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''No, No, Nanette'' had originated as a non-musical stage play called ''My Lady Friends'', which opened on Broadway in December 1919. ''My Lady Friends'' had, indeed, been financed by the Ruth sale to the Yankees.

During that period, the Red Sox, Yankees and [[Chicago White Sox]] had a détente; they were called &quot;Insurrectos&quot; because their actions antagonized league president Ban Johnson. Although Frazee owned the Boston Red Sox franchise, he did not own Fenway Park (it was owned by the Fenway Park Trust), making his ownership a precarious one; Johnson could move another team into the ballpark. His club was in debt, but Frazee felt the need to purchase its playing site (which he did in {{by|1920}}). Further, providing the Yankees with a [[box office]] attraction would help that mediocre club, which had sided with him against Johnson and &quot;the Loyal Five&quot; clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2002/0718/1407265.html|title=ESPN.com: MLB&amp;nbsp;— When the Yankees nearly moved to Boston&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Ruth was considered a serious disciplinary problem, a reputation he amply confirmed while playing for the Yankees. Frazee moved Ruth to stabilize Red Sox finances and cut distractions. It was a straight sale, no players in return.

New York achieved great success after acquiring Ruth and several other very good players. Boston, meanwhile, did poorly during the 20s and 30s, and the sale of Babe Ruth came to be viewed as the beginning of the [[Yankees – Red Sox rivalry]], considered the &quot;Greatest Rivalry on Earth&quot; by American sports journalists.&lt;ref name=ReverseCurse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frommer/&gt;

[[File:ALE-BOS-Logo-Old07.png|thumb|125px|BoSox logo from 1931 to 1932]]
After deciding to get out of baseball, Frazee began selling many of his star players. In the winter of 1920, [[Wally Schang]], [[Waite Hoyt]], [[Harry Harper]] and Mike McNally were traded to the Yankees for [[Del Pratt]], [[Muddy Ruel]], [[John Costello]], Hank Thormahlen, Sammy Vick and cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Schang_Wally.stm|title=Wally Schang | BaseballLibrary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1921 in baseball|following winter]], iron man [[shortstop]] [[Everett Scott]], and pitchers [[Bullet Joe Bush]] and [[Sad Sam Jones]] were traded to the Yankees for [[Roger Peckinpaugh]] (who would be immediately shipped to the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]]), [[Jack Quinn (baseball)|Jack Quinn]], [[Rip Collins]], Bill Piercy and $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Scott_Everett.stm|title=Everett Scott | BaseballLibrary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, {{by|1922}}, [[Joe Dugan]] and [[Elmer Smith (baseball outfielder, born 1892)|Elmer Smith]] were traded to the Yankees for Elmer Miller, Chick Fewster, [[Johnny Mitchell (baseball)|Johnny Mitchell]], and [[Lefty O'Doul]], who was at the time a mediocre pitching prospect. Acquiring Dugan helped the Yankees edge the [[1922 St. Louis Browns season|St. Louis Browns]] in a tight pennant race, and the resulting uproar helped create a June 15 trading deadline that went into effect the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Smith_Elmer309.stm|title=Elmer Smith | BaseballLibrary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps an even more outrageous deal was the trade of [[Herb Pennock]], occurring in early {{by|1923}}. Pennock was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees for Camp Skinner, Norm McMillan, [[George Murray (baseball)|George Murray]] and $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/p/pennohe01.shtml#TRANS|title=Herb Pennock Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over an eight-year period from {{by|1925}} to {{by|1932}}, the Red Sox averaged over 100 losses per season. One of the few bright spots on these teams was [[Earl Webb]], who set the all-time mark for most doubles in a season in {{by|1931}} with 67. The BoSox’ fortunes began to change in {{by|1933}} when [[Tom Yawkey]] bought the team. Yawkey acquired pitcher [[Wes Ferrell]] and one of the greatest pitchers of all-time, [[Lefty Grove]], making his team competitive once again in the late thirties. He also acquired [[Joe Cronin]], an outstanding shortstop and manager and slugging [[first baseman]] [[Jimmie Foxx]] whose 50 home runs in 1938 would stand as a club record for 68 years. Foxx also drove in a club record 175 runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/f/foxxji01.shtml |title=Jimmie Foxx Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1939–1960===

In {{by|1939}}, the Red Sox purchased the contract of [[outfielder]] [[Ted Williams]] from the minor league [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], ushering in an era of the team sometimes called the &quot;Ted Sox.&quot; Williams consistently hit for both high power and high average, and is generally considered one of the greatest hitters of all time. The right-field bullpens in Fenway were built in part for Williams' [[left-handed]] swing, and are sometimes called &quot;Williamsburg.&quot; Before this addition, it was over {{convert|400|ft|m}} to right field. He served two stints in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a pilot and saw [[active duty]] in both [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]], missing at least five full seasons of baseball. His book ''The Science of Hitting'' is widely read by students of baseball. He is currently the last player to hit over .400 for a full season, batting .406 in {{by|1941}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/w/willite01.shtml|title=Ted Williams Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams feuded with sports writers his whole career, calling them &quot;The Knights of the Keyboard,&quot; and his relationship with the fans was often rocky as he was seen spitting towards the stands on more than one occasion.

With Williams, the Red Sox reached the [[1946 World Series]], but lost to the [[1946 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games in part because of the use of the &quot;Williams Shift,&quot; a defensive tactic in which the shortstop would move to the right side of the infield to make it harder for the left-handed-hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field. Some have claimed that he was too proud to hit to the other side of the field, not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game. His performance may have also been affected by a pitch he took in the elbow in an exhibition game a few days earlier. Either way, in his only World Series, Williams gathering just five singles in 25 [[At bat|at-bats]] for a .200 average.

The Cardinals won the {{by|1946}} Series when [[Enos Slaughter]] scored the go-ahead run all the way from first base on a [[Hit (baseball)|base hit]] to left field. The throw from [[Leon Culberson]] was cut off by shortstop [[Johnny Pesky]], who relayed the ball to the plate just a hair too late. Some say Pesky hesitated or &quot;held the ball&quot; before he turned to throw the ball, but this has been disputed.

Along with Williams and Pesky, the Red Sox featured several other star players during the 1940s, including second baseman [[Bobby Doerr]] and center fielder [[Dom DiMaggio]] (the younger brother of [[Joe DiMaggio]]).

The Red Sox narrowly lost the AL pennant in {{by|1948}} and {{by|1949}}. In [[1948 Major League Baseball season|1948]], [[1948 Boston Red Sox season|Boston]] finished in a tie with [[1948 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]], and their loss to Cleveland in a [[one-game playoff]] ended hopes of an all-Boston World Series. Curiously, manager [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joseph McCarthy]] chose journeyman [[Denny Galehouse]] to start the playoff game when the young lefty phenom [[Mel Parnell]] was available to pitch. In [[1949 Major League Baseball season|1949]], the [[1949 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] were one game ahead of the [[1949 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], with the only two games left for both teams being against each other, and they lost both of those games.

[[File:ALE-BOS-Logo-Old09.png|thumb|150px|Logo used by the BoSox in the 1950s]]The 1950s were viewed as a time of tribulation for the Red Sox. After Williams returned from the Korean War in {{by|1953}}, many of the best players from the late 1940s had retired or been traded. The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox' daily lineup &quot;Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs.&quot; [[Jackie Robinson]] was even worked out by the team at Fenway Park, however it appeared that owner Tom Yawkey did not want an African American player on his team at that time. [[Willie Mays]] also tried out for Boston and was highly praised by team scouts. Ted Williams hit .388 at the age of 38 in {{by|1957}}, but there was little else for Boston fans to root for. Williams retired at the end of the {{by|1960}} [[1960 Major League Baseball season|season]], famously hitting a home run in his final at-bat as memorialized in the [[John Updike]] story &quot;Hub fans bid Kid adieu.&quot; The Red Sox finally became the last Major League team to field an [[African American]] player when they promoted [[infielder]] [[Pumpsie Green]] from their AAA [[farm system|farm team]] in {{by|1959}}.

===1960s===
{{Main|The Impossible Dream (1967)}}
&lt;!--No Source Information: [[Image:Carl_yastrzemski.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Carl &quot;Yaz&quot; Yastrzemski]]--&gt;
The 1960s also started poorly for the Red Sox, though 1961 saw the debut of [[Carl Yastrzemski|Carl &quot;Yaz&quot; Yastrzemski]], Williams' replacement in left field, who developed into one of the better hitters of a pitching-rich decade.

Red Sox fans know {{by|1967}} as the [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|season]] of the &quot;Impossible Dream.&quot; The slogan refers to the hit song from the popular [[Musical theatre|musical play]] &quot;[[Man of La Mancha]]&quot;. [[1967 Major League Baseball season|1967]] saw one of the great pennant races in [[History of baseball|baseball history]] with four teams in the AL pennant race until almost the last game. The BoSox had finished the {{by|1966}} [[1966 Major League Baseball season|season]] in ninth place, but they found new life with Yastrzemski as the team went to the [[1967 World Series]]. Yastrzemski won the American League Triple Crown (the most recent player to accomplish such a feat), hitting .326 with 44 [[home run]]s and 121 RBIs. He finished one vote short of a unanimous MVP selection, as a Minnesota sportswriter placed Twins center fielder [[César Tovar]] first on his ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/y/yastrca01.shtml |title=Carl Yastrzemski Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Red Sox lost the series&amp;nbsp;— again to the St. Louis Cardinals, in seven games. Legendary pitcher [[Bob Gibson]] stymied the Red Sox winning three games.

An 18-year-old Bostonian rookie named [[Tony Conigliaro]] slugged 24 home runs in {{by|1964}}. &quot;Tony C&quot; became the youngest player in Major League Baseball to hit his 100th home run, a record that stands today. However, he was struck just above the left [[Zygomatic bone|cheek bone]] by a fastball thrown by [[Jack Hamilton (baseball)|Jack Hamilton]] of the [[1967 California Angels season|California Angels]] on Friday, August 18, {{by|1967}}. Conigliaro sat out the entire next season with headaches and blurred vision. Although he did have a productive season in {{by|1970}}, he'd never be the same.

===1970s===
[[File:ALE-BOS-Logo-Old10.png|thumb|150px|1960–1978 logo]]
Although the Red Sox were competitive for much of the late 1960s and early 1970s, they never finished higher than second place in their division. The closest they came to a divisional title was {{by|1972}}, when they lost by a half-game to the [[1972 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]]. The start of the season was delayed by a players' strike, and the Red Sox further lost a game to a rainout that was never replayed, which caused the Red Sox to lose the division by a half-game. On October 2, 1972, they also lost the second to last game of the year to the Tigers, 3–1, when [[Luis Aparicio]] fell rounding third after Yastrzemski hit a triple in the third inning, Aparicio tried to scamper back to third but this created an out as Yastrzemski was already on third.

The Red Sox won the AL pennant in {{by|1975}}. The [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|1975 Red Sox]] were as colorful as they were talented, with Yastrzemski and rookie outfielders [[Jim Rice]] and [[Fred Lynn]], veteran outfielder [[Dwight Evans]], [[catcher]] [[Carlton Fisk]], and pitchers [[Luis Tiant]] and eccentric junkballer [[Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher)|Bill &quot;The Spaceman&quot; Lee]]. Fred Lynn won both the American League [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award and the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|Most Valuable Player]] award, a feat which had never previously been accomplished, and was not duplicated until [[Ichiro Suzuki]] did it in {{by|2001}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/roy_rol.shtml|title=Rookie of the Year Awards &amp; Rolaids Relief Award Winners&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;oezowb&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/mvp_cya.shtml Most Valuable Player MVP Awards &amp; Cy Young Awards Winners – Baseball-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1975 American League Championship Series]], the Red Sox swept the [[1975 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]].

In the [[1975 World Series]], they faced the heavily favored [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], also known as [[The Big Red Machine]]. Luis Tiant won games 1 and 4 of the World Series but after five games, the Red Sox trailed the series 3 games to 2. Game 6 at Fenway Park is considered among the greatest games in postseason history. Down 6–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning, Red Sox [[pinch hitter]] [[Bernie Carbo]] hit a three run homer into the center field bleachers off Reds fireman [[Rawly Eastwick]] to tie the game. In the top of the eleventh inning, [[right fielder]] Dwight Evans made a spectacular catch of a [[Joe Morgan]] line drive and doubled [[Ken Griffey Sr.|Ken Griffey]] at first base to preserve the tie. In the bottom of the twelfth inning, Carlton Fisk hit a deep fly ball which sliced towards the left field foul pole above the [[Green Monster]]. As the ball sailed into the night, Fisk waved his arms frantically towards fair territory, seemingly pleading with the ball not to go foul. The ball complied, and bedlam ensued at Fenway as Fisk rounded the bases to win the game for the Red Sox 7–6.

The Red Sox lost game 7, 4–3 even though they had an early 3–0 lead. Starting pitcher Bill Lee threw a slow looping curve which he called a &quot;Leephus pitch&quot; or &quot;space ball&quot; to Reds first baseman [[Tony Perez]] who hit the ball over the Green Monster and across the street. The Reds scored the winning run in the 9th inning. Carlton Fisk said famously about the 1975 World Series, &quot;We won that thing 3 games to 4.&quot;

====1978 pennant race====
In {{by|1978}}, the Red Sox and the Yankees were involved in a tight pennant race. The Yankees were 14½ [[games behind]] the Red Sox in July, and on September 10, after completing a 4-game sweep of the Red Sox (known as &quot;The Boston Massacre&quot;), the Yankees tied for the divisional lead.

On September 16 the Yankees held a 3 {{frac|1|2}} game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 11 of their next 13 games and by the final day of the season, the Yankees' magic number to win the division was one&amp;nbsp;— with a win over Cleveland or a Boston loss to the [[1978 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] clinching the division. However, [[1978 New York Yankees season|New York]] lost 9–2 and Boston won 5–0, forcing a one-game playoff to be held at Fenway Park on Monday, October 2.

The most remembered moment from the game was [[Bucky Dent]]'s 7th inning three-run home run in off Mike Torrez just over the Green Monster, giving the Yankees their first lead.&lt;ref name=BuckyDent/&gt; [[Reggie Jackson]] provided a solo home run in the 8th that proved to be the difference in the Yankees' 5–4 win, which ended with Yastrzemski popping out to [[Graig Nettles]] in foul territory with [[Rick Burleson]] representing the tying run at third. Although Dent became a Red Sox demon, the Red Sox would get retribution in 1990 when the Yankees fired Dent as their manager during a series at Fenway Park.&lt;ref name=BuckyDent&gt;{{cite news|title=Dent Dumped by Yankees|date=June 7, 1990|first=Nick|last=Cafardo|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=37|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/61640175.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+7%2C+1990&amp;author=Nick+Cafardo%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=37&amp;desc=DENT+DUMPED+BY+YANKEES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1986 season===

{{Main|1986 World Series}}
Carl Yastrzemski retired after the {{by|1983}} season, during which the [[1983 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] finished sixth in the seven-team AL East, posting their worst record since {{by|1966}}. However, in {{by|1986}}, it appeared that the team's fortunes were about to change. The offense had remained strong with Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, [[Don Baylor]] and [[Wade Boggs]]. [[Roger Clemens]] led the pitching staff, going 24–4 with a 2.48 [[Earned run average|ERA]], and had a 20-strikeout game&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/clemero02.shtml |title=Roger Clemens Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to win both the [[American League]] [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] and Most Valuable Player awards. Clemens became the first starting pitcher to win both awards since [[Vida Blue]] in {{by|1971}}, and no starting pitcher has won the MVP award in either league since.&lt;ref name = &quot;oezowb&quot; /&gt;

The [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] won the AL East for the first time in 11 seasons, and faced the [[1986 California Angels season|California Angels]] in the [[1986 American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]]. The teams split the first two games in Boston, but the Angels won the next two home games, taking a 3–1 lead in the series. With the Angels poised to win the series, the Red Sox trailed 5–2 heading into the ninth inning of Game 5. A two-run homer by Baylor cut the lead to one. With two outs and a runner on, and one strike away from elimination, [[Dave Henderson]] homered off [[Donnie Moore]] to put Boston up 6–5. Although the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox won in the 11th on a Henderson sacrifice fly off Moore. The Red Sox then found themselves with six- and seven-run wins at Fenway Park in Games 6 and 7 to win the American League title.

The Red Sox faced a heavily favored [[1986 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] team that had won 108 games in the regular season in the [[1986 World Series]]. Boston won the first two games in [[Shea Stadium]] but lost the next two at Fenway, knotting the series at 2 games apiece. After [[Bruce Hurst]] recorded his second victory of the series in Game 5, the Red Sox returned to [[Shea Stadium]] looking to garner their first championship in 68 years. However, Game 6 would go down as one of the most devastating losses in club history. After pitching seven strong innings, Clemens was lifted from the game with a 3–2 lead. Years later, Manager [[John McNamara (baseball)|John McNamara]] said Clemens was suffering from a blister and asked to be taken out of the game, a claim Clemens denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?id=1206543|title=ESPN.com: Page 2: Is Clemens the Antichrist?|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mets then scored a run off [[relief pitcher|reliever]] and former Met [[Calvin Schiraldi]] to tie the score 3–3. The game went to extra innings, where the Red Sox took a 5–3 lead in the top of the 10th on a solo home run by Henderson, a double by Boggs and an RBI single by second baseman [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]].

After recording two outs in the bottom of the 10th, a graphic appeared on the [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC telecast]] hailing Barrett as the Player of the Game, and Bruce Hurst had been named World Series MVP. A message even appeared briefly on the Shea Stadium scoreboard congratulating the Red Sox as world champions. After so many years of abject frustration, Red Sox fans around the world could taste victory. With two strikes, Mets catcher [[Gary Carter]] hit a single. It was followed by singles by [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]] and [[Ray Knight]]. With [[Mookie Wilson]] batting, a wild pitch by [[Bob Stanley]] tied the game at 5. Wilson then hit a slow ground ball to first; the ball rolled through [[Bill Buckner]]'s legs, allowing Knight to score the winning run from second.

While Buckner was singled out as responsible for the loss, many observers&amp;nbsp;— as well as both Wilson and Buckner&amp;nbsp;— have noted that even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly, the speedy Wilson probably would still have been safe, leaving the game-winning run at third with two out.

Many observers questioned why Buckner was in the game at that point considering he had bad knees and that [[Dave Stapleton (infielder)|Dave Stapleton]] had come in as a late-inning defensive replacement in prior series games. It appeared as though McNamara was trying to reward Buckner for his long and illustrious career by leaving him in the game. After falling behind 3–0, the Mets then won Game 7, concluding the devastating collapse and feeding the myth that the Red Sox were &quot;cursed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Babe Ruth Curse Strikes Again|date=October 28, 1986|first=George|last=Vecsey|work=The New York Times|page=D33|authorlink=George Vecsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This World Series loss had a strange twist: Red Sox General Manager [[Lou Gorman]] was vice-president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983. Working under Mets' GM [[Frank Cashen]], with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship.

===1988–1991===
The [[1988 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] returned to the postseason in [[1988 Major League Baseball season|1988]]. With the club in fourth place midway through the 1988 season at the All-Star break, manager John McNamara was fired and replaced by [[Joe Morgan (manager)|Joe Morgan]] on July 15. Immediately the club won 12 games in a row, and 19 of 20 overall, to surge to the AL East title in what would be referred to as ''Morgan Magic''. But the magic was short-lived, as the team was swept by the [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in the [[1988 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. Ironically, the MVP of that Series was former Red Sox pitcher and Baseball Hall of Fame player [[Dennis Eckersley]], who saved all four wins for Oakland. Two years later, in [[1990 Major League Baseball season|1990]], the [[1990 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] would again win the division and face the [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]] in the [[1990 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. However, the outcome was the same, with the A's sweeping the ALCS in four straight.

In 1990, Yankees fans started to chant &quot;1918!&quot; to taunt the Red Sox.&lt;ref name=&quot;1918!&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shaughnessy|first=Dan|title=The Curse of the Bambino|year=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-525-24887-0|authorlink=Dan Shaughnessy|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ReverseCurse&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shaughnessy|first=Dan|title=Reversing the Curse|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston|isbn=0-618-51748-0|authorlink=Dan Shaughnessy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Pennant Chases in East Still Flying High, West All but Flagged|date=September 25, 1990|first=Mark|last=Maske|work=The Washington Post|page=E3|quote=Yankees fans had taunted the Red Sox all weekend with chants of &quot;1918, 1918!&quot;—the last time Boston won the World Series—and the Red Sox are not allowed by long-suffering New Englanders to forget the pain they have wrought with years of excruciating near misses.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demeaning chant would echo at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] each time the Red Sox were there. Also, Fenway Park became the scene of [[Bucky Dent]]'s worst moment as a manager, although it was where he had his greatest triumph.&lt;ref name=BuckyDent/&gt; In June, when the Red Sox swept the Yankees during a four-game series at Fenway Park,&lt;ref name=Frommer/&gt; the Yankees fired Dent as their manager.&lt;ref name=BuckyDent/&gt; Red Sox fans felt retribution to Dent being fired on their field.&lt;ref name=BuckyDent/&gt;

===1992–2001===
Tom Yawkey died in {{by|1976}}, and his wife [[Jean R. Yawkey]] took control of the team until her death in {{by|1992}}. Their initials are shown in two stripes on the [[Green Monster|Left field wall]] in [[Morse code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/bos/ballpark/facts.jsp|title=The Official Site of The Boston Red Sox: Ballpark: Fenway Facts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Jean's death, control of the team passed to the Yawkey Trust, led by [[John Harrington (Red Sox CEO)|John Harrington]]. The trust sold the team in 2002, concluding 70 years of Yawkey ownership.

In {{by|1994}}, General Manager [[Lou Gorman]] was replaced by [[Dan Duquette]], a Massachusetts native who had worked for the [[Montreal Expos]]. Duquette revived the team's [[minor league baseball|farm system]], which during his tenure produced players such as [[Nomar Garciaparra]], [[Carl Pavano]] and [[David Eckstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/e/eckstda01.shtml|title=David Eckstein Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duquette also spent money on free agents, notably an eight-year, $160 million deal for [[Manny Ramírez]] after the {{by|2000}} [[2000 Major League Baseball season|season]].

The [[1995 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] won the newly realigned [[American League East]] in {{by|1995}}, finishing seven games ahead of the [[1995 New York Yankees season|Yankees]]. However, they were swept in three games in the [[1995 American League Division Series|ALDS]] by the [[1995 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]]. Their postseason losing streak reached 13 straight games, dating back to the 1986 World Series.

Roger Clemens tied his major league record by fanning 20 [[1996 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] on September 18, {{by|1996}} in what would prove to be one of his final appearances in a Red Sox uniform. After Clemens had turned 30 and then had four seasons, 1993–96, which were by his standards mediocre at best, Duquette said the pitcher was entering &quot;the twilight of his career.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=crasnick_jerry&amp;id=2124180&amp;CMP=OTC-DT9705204233&amp;action=login&amp;appRedirect=http%3a%2f%2finsider.espn.go.com%2fmlb%2fcolumns%2fstory%3fcolumnist%3dcrasnick_jerry%26id%3d2124180%26CMP%3dOTC-DT9705204233|title=Clemens putting Cooperstown on hold}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clemens went on to pitch well for another ten years and win four more Cy Young awards.

Out of contention in {{by|1997}}, the team traded closer [[Heathcliff Slocumb]] to Seattle for catching prospect [[Jason Varitek]] and right-handed pitcher [[Derek Lowe]]. Prior to the start of the {{by|1998}} [[1998 Major League Baseball season|season]], the Red Sox dealt pitchers [[Tony Armas, Jr.]] and Carl Pavano to the Montreal Expos for pitcher [[Pedro Martínez]]. Martínez became the anchor of the team's pitching staff and turned in several outstanding seasons. In 1998, the [[1998 Boston Red Sox season|team]] won the American League [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|Wild Card]], but again lost the [[1998 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] to the [[1998 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]].

In {{by|1999}}, Duquette called Fenway Park &quot;economically obsolete&quot; and, along with Red Sox ownership, led a push for a new stadium.

On the field, the [[1999 Boston Red Sox season|1999 Red Sox]] were finally able to overturn their fortunes against the Indians. [[1999 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]] took a 2–0 series lead, but Boston won the next three games behind strong pitching by Derek Lowe, Pedro Martínez and his brother [[Ramón Martínez (baseball pitcher)|Ramón Martínez]]. Game 4's 23–7 win by the Red Sox was the highest-scoring playoff game in major league history. Game 5 began with the Indians taking a 5–2 lead after two innings, but Pedro Martínez, nursing a shoulder injury, came on in the fourth inning and pitched six innings without allowing a hit while the team's offense rallied for a 12–8 win behind two home runs and seven RBIs from outfielder [[Troy O'Leary]]. After the ALDS victory, the Red Sox lost the [[1999 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] to the Yankees, four games to one. The one bright spot was a lopsided win for the Red Sox in the much-hyped Martinez-Clemens game.

===2002–present: Henry comes to Boston===
====2002====
{{Main|2002 Boston Red Sox season}}
In {{by|2002}}, the Red Sox were sold by Yawkey trustee and president Harrington to [[New England Sports Ventures]], a consortium headed by principal owner [[John Henry (baseball)|John Henry]]. [[Tom Werner]] served as executive chairman, [[Larry Lucchino]] served as president and CEO, and serving as vice chairman was [[Les Otten]]. Dan Duquette was fired as GM of the club on February 28, with former Angels GM [[Mike Port]] taking the helm for the [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002 season]]. A week later, manager Joe Kerrigan was fired and was replaced by [[Grady Little]].

While nearly all offseason moves were made under Dan Duquette, such as signing outfielder [[Johnny Damon]] away from the Oakland A's, the new ownership made additions after their purchase of the team, including trading for outfielder [[Cliff Floyd]] and relief pitcher [[Alan Embree]]. Nomar Garciaparra, Manny Ramírez, and Floyd all hit well, while Pedro Martínez put up his usual outstanding numbers. Derek Lowe, newly converted into a starter, won 20 games—becoming the first player to save 20 games and win 20 games in back-to-back seasons. The Red Sox won 93 games but they finished 10½ games behind the [[2002 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] for the division and 6 behind the [[2002 Anaheim Angels season|Angels]] for the AL wild card.

====2003====
{{Main|2003 Boston Red Sox season}}
In the off-season, Port was replaced by [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate [[Theo Epstein]]. Epstein, raised in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], and just 28 at the time of his hiring, became the youngest general manager in MLB history.

[[File:2003-09-25 - Fenway Park 11.jpg|thumb|right|The Red Sox celebrate their clinching of the 2003 AL Wild Card with a victory over the [[2003 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]].]]
The &quot;Idiots&quot; of {{by|2004}} arose out of the &quot;Cowboy Up&quot; team of {{by|2003}}, a nickname derived from first baseman [[Kevin Millar]]'s challenge to his teammates to show more determination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowboyup&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2003/09/24/rallying_cry_spurs_sox_to_finish_ride/|publisher=Boston Globe|date=September 24, 2003|title=Rallying Cry Spurs Sox To Finish Ride|first=Joseph P.|last=Kahn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Millar, the team's offense was so deep that 2003 batting champion [[Bill Mueller]] batted 7th in the lineup behind sluggers Manny Ramírez and the newly acquired [[David Ortiz]].

GM Theo Epstein, noticing that Mueller was hitting very well in a limited role, traded Shea Hillenbrand to the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] for [[Byung-Hyun Kim]]. Receiving much more playing time following the trade, Ortiz contributed significantly in the second half of the season. The trade ended up greatly benefiting the team, as the Red Sox broke many batting records&lt;ref name=2003records&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redsoxdiehard.com/stats/record.html|title=More Red Sox Records&amp;nbsp;— RedSoxDiehard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the AL Wild Card.

In the [[2003 American League Division Series]], the Red Sox rallied from a 0–2 series deficit against the [[2003 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] to win the best-of-five series. Derek Lowe returned to his former relief pitching role to save Game 5, a 4–3 victory. The team then faced the [[2003 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in the [[2003 American League Championship Series]]. In Game 7, Boston led 5–2 in the eighth inning, but Pedro Martínez allowed three runs to tie the game. The Red Sox could not score off [[Mariano Rivera]] over the last three innings and eventually lost the game 6–5 when Yankee third baseman [[Aaron Boone]] hit a solo home run off Tim Wakefield.

Some placed the blame for the loss on manager Grady Little&lt;ref name=Gradyjob&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2003/10/23/little_unsure_he_wants_job/|title=Boston Globe, Little unsure he wants job, by Gordon Edes, 23 October 2003 | work=The Boston Globe | date=October 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; for failing to remove starting pitcher Martínez in the 8th inning after some observers believe he began to show signs of tiring. Others credited Little with the team's successful season and dramatic come-from-behind victory in the ALDS. Nevertheless, Boston's management decided a change was in order and did not renew Little's contract. He was replaced by former [[Philadelphia Phillies]] manager [[Terry Francona]].

====2004: World Series Championship====
{{Main|2004 Boston Red Sox season}}
During the 2003–04 offseason, the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher, [[Curt Schilling]], and a closer, [[Keith Foulke]]. Expectations once again ran high that {{by|2004}} would be the year that the Red Sox ended their championship drought. The regular season started well in April, but through mid-season the team struggled due to injuries, inconsistency, and defensive woes.

Management shook up the team at the MLB trading deadline on July 31 with a blockbuster four team trade. They traded the team's popular yet often injured shortstop Nomar Garciaparra with outfielder [[Matt Murton]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]]. The Cubs sent [[Brendan Harris]], [[Alex Gonzalez (shortstop, born 1973)|Alex Gonzalez]] and [[Francis Beltran]] to the Montreal Expos, and minor leaguer Justin Jones to the [[Minnesota Twins]]. The Red Sox received first baseman [[Doug Mientkiewicz]] from the Twins, and shortstop [[Orlando Cabrera]] from the Expos.

In a separate transaction, the Red Sox traded minor leaguer Henri Stanley to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for center fielder [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]]. Following the trades, the club immediately turned things around, winning 22 out of 25 games and qualifying for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. Players and fans affectionately referred to the players as &quot;The Idiots,&quot; a term coined by Johnny Damon and Kevin Millar during the playoff push to describe the team's eclectic roster and devil-may-care attitude toward their supposed &quot;curse.&quot;

Boston began the postseason by sweeping the [[American League West|AL West]] champion [[2004 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim Angels]] in the [[2004 American League Division Series|ALDS]]. However, Curt Schilling suffered a torn ankle tendon in Game 1 when he was hit by a line drive. In the third game of the series, [[Vladimir Guerrero]] hit a grand slam off [[Mike Timlin]] in the 7th inning to tie the game. However, David Ortiz hit a walk-off two-run homer in the 10th inning to win the game. The Red Sox advanced to a rematch in the [[2004 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] against the [[2004 New York Yankees season|Yankees]].

The series started very poorly for the Red Sox. Schilling, pitching injured, was routed for six runs in three innings and Boston ended up losing Game 1. In the second game, with his Yankees leading 1–0 for most of the game, [[John Olerud]] hit a two-run home run to put New York up for good. Following this, the Red Sox were down three games to none after a crushing 19–8 loss in Game 3 at home.

Up to this point, no team in the history of baseball had come back to win from a 3–0 series deficit. In Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4–3 in the ninth with Mariano Rivera in to close for the Yankees. After Rivera issued a walk to Kevin Millar, Dave Roberts came on to pinch run and promptly stole second base. He then scored on an RBI single by Bill Mueller, sending the game into extra innings. The Red Sox went on to win the game on a two-run home run by David Ortiz in the 12th inning. Game 5 would last 14 innings, setting the record for the longest ALCS game ever played. Both sides squandered many opportunities, until Ortiz again sealed the win with a walk-off RBI single in the bottom of the 14th.

[[File:2004 WorldSeries Trophy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Commissioner's Trophy (2004 World Series)]]
With the series returning to [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] for Game 6, the comeback continued with Schilling pitching on a bad ankle. Three sutures being used to stabilize the tendon in Schilling's right ankle bled throughout the game, making his sock appear bloody red. Schilling only allowed one run over 7 innings to lead the Red Sox to victory. In Game 7, the Red Sox completed their historic comeback owing to the strength of Derek Lowe's pitching and Johnny Damon's two home runs (including a grand slam in the second inning). The Yankees were defeated 10–3. Ortiz, who had the game winning RBIs in Games 4 and 5, was named ALCS Most Valuable Player. The Red Sox joined the [[1941–42 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1942 Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[1974–75 New York Islanders season|1975 New York Islanders]] as the only [[professional sports]] teams in history to win a best-of-seven games series after being down three games to none. The [[2009–10 Philadelphia Flyers season|2010 Philadelphia Flyers]] would also do it during their [[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella]] march to the [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]].

The Red Sox swept the [[2004 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2004 World Series]]. The Red Sox began the series with an 11–9 win, marked by [[Mark Bellhorn]]'s game-winning home run off Pesky's Pole. Game 2 in Boston was won thanks to another great performance by the bloody-socked Curt Schilling. Pedro Martínez (in his first World Series performance) shut out the Cardinals for seven innings and led Boston to a 4–1 victory in game 3, and Derek Lowe and the Red Sox did not allow a single run in game 4. The game ended as [[Edgar Rentería]] hit the ball back to closer Keith Foulke. After Foulke lobbed the ball to Mientkiewicz at first, the Red Sox had won their first World Championship in 86 years. [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] commentator [[Joe Buck]] famously called the play with: &quot;Back to Foulke. Red Sox fans have longed to hear it: The Boston Red Sox are World Champions!&quot;

Boston held the Cardinals' offense to only three runs in the final three games and never trailed in the series. Manny Ramírez was named [[World Series MVP]]. To add a final, surreal touch to Boston's championship season, on the night of Game 4 a [[total lunar eclipse]] colored the moon red over [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]]. The city of Boston held a &quot;rolling rally&quot; for the team on October 30, 2004. [[Red Sox Nation]] packed the streets of Boston that Saturday to celebrate as the team rode on the city's famous [[DUKW|Duck Boats]]. The Red Sox earned many accolades from the sports media and throughout the nation for their incredible season. In December, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named the Boston Red Sox the 2004 [[Sportsman of the Year|Sportsmen of the Year]].

With the [[New England Patriots]] winning [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] in February, Boston became the first city since Pittsburgh in 1979 to have both Super Bowl and World Series champions in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Leonard|last=Shapiro|title=Patriots Grab Share of NFL History|newspaper=Washington Post|date=February 7, 2005|url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A3727-2005Feb6?language=printer|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2005====
{{Main|2005 Boston Red Sox season}}
After winning its first World Series in 86 years, the club re-signed Jason Varitek and named him team captain. The {{by|2005}} AL East would be decided on the last weekend of the season, with the [[2005 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] coming to Fenway Park with a one-game lead in the standings. The Red Sox won two of the three games to finish the season with the same record as the Yankees, 95–67. However, a playoff was not needed. The Yankees had won the season series, 10–9, thus they won the division, and the Red Sox settled for the Wild Card. Boston was swept in three games by the eventual [[2005 World Series]] champion [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] in the [[2005 American League Division Series|first round]] of the playoffs.

====2005–2006 off-season====
[[File:2006Boston010.jpg|thumb|225x|left|A [[CowParade]] cow in Boston decorated to celebrate the Red Sox, 2006]]
On October 31, 2005, general manager Theo Epstein resigned on the last day of his contract. On [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] evening, the Red Sox announced the acquisition of pitcher [[Josh Beckett]] and third baseman [[Mike Lowell]] from the [[Florida Marlins]], while sending several prospects including [[Hanley Ramírez]] to the Marlins. Fan-favorite Johnny Damon broke the hearts of Red Sox Nation by signing a four-year, $52 million deal with the Yankees. The team filled the vacancy in center field left by Damon's departure by trading for Cleveland Indians center fielder [[Coco Crisp]]. However, Crisp fractured his left index finger in April and would end up missing over 50 games in {{by|2006}}. In January 2006, Epstein came to terms with the Red Sox and was once again named General Manager.

====2006 season====
{{Main|2006 Boston Red Sox season}}
The revamped Red Sox infield, with third baseman Mike Lowell joining new shortstop [[Álex González (shortstop, born 1977)|Álex González]], second baseman [[Mark Loretta]], and first baseman [[Kevin Youkilis]] was one of the best-fielding infields in baseball. The Red Sox committed the fewest errors in the American League in [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]], and on June 30, Boston set a major league record of 17 straight errorless games. One of the brightest spots of the 2006 season was the emergence of new closer [[Jonathan Papelbon]]. Papelbon ended up setting a Red Sox rookie record with 35 saves and earning an [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] appearance. Also, David Ortiz provided a late-season highlight when he broke Jimmie Foxx's single season Red Sox home run record by hitting 54 homers. Down the stretch, the Red Sox wilted under the pressure of mounting injuries and poor performances. Boston would compile a 9–21 record in the month of August. Injuries to Jason Varitek, Trot Nixon, and Manny Ramírez severely hurt the offense. Also, injuries to Tim Wakefield, rookie [[Jon Lester]] (diagnosed with [[lymphoma]]), and Matt Clement left the rotation with major holes to fill. The Red Sox finished 2006 with an 86–76 record and third place in the AL East.

====2007: World Series Championship====

[[File:Red Sox 2007.jpg|200px|right|thumb|2007 season final standing]]
Theo Epstein's first step toward restocking the team for {{by|2007}} was to pursue one of the most anticipated acquisitions in baseball history. On November 14, MLB announced that Boston had won the bid for the rights to negotiate a contract with [[Japanese people|Japanese]] superstar pitcher [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]]. Boston placed a bid of $51.1 million and had 30 days to complete a deal. On December 13, Matsuzaka signed a 6-year, $52 million contract.

Fan favorite [[Trot Nixon]] filed for free agency and agreed on a deal with the Indians. With an opening in right field, the Red Sox signed [[J.D. Drew]] on January 25, 2007 to a 5-year, $70 million contract. Free agent Shortstop [[Álex González (shortstop, born 1977)|Álex González]] was replaced by another free agent, [[Julio Lugo]]. Second baseman Mark Loretta also left via free agency for the [[Houston Astros]], opening a spot for rookie [[Dustin Pedroia]].

The Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East by mid-April and never relinquished their division lead. While Ortiz and Ramirez provided their usual offense, it was the hitting of Lowell, Youkilis, and Pedroia that anchored the club through the first few months. While Drew, Lugo, and Coco Crisp struggled to provide offense, Lowell and Youkilis more than made up for it with averages well above .300 and impressive home run and RBI totals. Pedroia started badly, hitting below .200 in April. Manager Terry Francona stuck with him and his patience paid off as Pedroia finished the first half over .300.

On the mound, Josh Beckett emerged as the ace of the staff and was 12–2 at the all-star break. His success was needed as Schilling, Matsuzaka, Wakefield and Tavarez all struggled at times. Meanwhile, the Boston bullpen, anchored by Papelbon and [[Hideki Okajima]], was there to pick up the starters often. Papelbon served as the stopper, and the rise of Okajima as a legitimate setup man and occasional closer gave the Red Sox more options late in the game. Okajima posted an ERA of 0.88 through the first half and was selected for the All-Star Game.

By the [[2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star break]], Boston had the best record in baseball and held their largest lead in the American League East, 10 games over the [[2007 Toronto Blue Jays season|Blue Jays]] and [[2007 New York Yankees season|Yankees]]. In the second half, more stars emerged for the Red Sox as they continued to lead the AL East. Beckett continued to shine, reaching 20 wins for the first time in his career. At one point, veteran Tim Wakefield found himself atop the AL in wins and finished with a 17–12 record. Minor league call-up [[Clay Buchholz]] provided a spark on September 1 by pitching a no-hitter in his second career start. Another call-up, outfielder [[Jacoby Ellsbury]], was thrust into the starting lineup while Manny Ramírez rested through most of September. Ellsbury played brilliantly during the month, hitting .361 with 3 HR, 17 RBI, and 8 stolen bases. Mike Lowell continued to carry the club, hitting cleanup in September and leading the team with 120 RBI for the season. Eventual 2007 Rookie of the Year Dustin Pedroia finished his outstanding first full season with 165 hits and a .317 average. The Red Sox became the first team to clinch a playoff spot for the 2007 season and the Red Sox captured their first AL East title since 1995.

The Red Sox swept the [[2007 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Angels]] in the [[2007 American League Division Series|ALDS]]. Facing the Indians in the [[2007 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], Josh Beckett won Game 1 but the Red Sox stumbled, losing the next three games. Facing a 3–1 deficit and a must-win situation, Beckett pitched eight innings while surrendering only one run and striking out 11 in a masterful Game 5 win. The Red Sox captured their twelfth American League pennant by outscoring the Indians 30–5 over the final three games, winning the final two games at Fenway Park.

The Red Sox faced the [[2007 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] in the [[2007 World Series]]. Beckett set the tone in game 1, pitching seven strong innings as the offense provided more than enough in a 13–1 victory. In Game 2, Schilling, Okajima, and Papelbon held the Rockies to one run again in a 2–1 game. Moving to [[Coors Field|Colorado]], the Red Sox offense made the difference again in a 10–5 win. Finally, in Game 4, Jon Lester took Wakefield's spot in the rotation and gave the Red Sox an impressive start, pitching 5⅔ shutout innings. The Rockies threatened, but thanks to World Series MVP Mike Lowell and aided by a home run by [[Bobby Kielty]], Papelbon registered another save as the Red Sox swept the Rockies in four games, capturing their second title in four years.

====2008====
{{Main|2008 Boston Red Sox season}}
Following their World Series victory, the Red Sox were forced to address a few personnel questions in the hopes of repeating as champion. The team re-signed free agents [[Mike Lowell]], [[Curt Schilling]], [[Tim Wakefield]] and [[Mike Timlin]]. The Red Sox also added veteran first baseman [[Sean Casey (baseball)|Sean Casey]] to back up [[Kevin Youkilis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Browne | first = Ian | title = Red Sox bring Casey on board | publisher = mlb.com | date = February 5, 2008 | url = http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080205&amp;content_id=2365093&amp;vkey=hotstove2007&amp;fext=.jsp|accessdate = April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries to Schilling, Timlin, and Josh Beckett landed each pitcher on the disabled list before the season began, putting added pressure on young starters Jon Lester and Clay Buchholz. The Red Sox began their season by participating in the third opening day game in MLB history to be played in [[Japan]], where they defeated the [[2008 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] in the [[Tokyo Dome]]. Boston played well to start the season, settling into a top position in the AL East. However, the surprise [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] took over the top of the division with a sweep over the Red Sox in early July. From May 17–22, the Sox had a winning streak of seven games, their longest of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;100random&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Chuck|first=Bill|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/extras/100_random_things_2009/|title=100 random things about the Red Sox, Rays, and Yankees|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=April 2, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, Lester threw the 18th no-hitter in team history, beating the [[2008 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] 7–0. During the season, Lester emerged as an anchor in the Red Sox rotation, leading the team in starts and innings pitched while compiling a 16–6 record and a 3.21 ERA. Buchholz meanwhile struggled mightily in 2008 to a 2–9 record, ending up back in the minors. Injuries would take a toll on the Red Sox offense during the season. David Ortiz missed 45 games with an injured wrist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Shroyer|first=Shawn|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080907&amp;content_id=3433116&amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos|title=Wrist still giving Big Papi some trouble|work=MLB.com|publisher=redsox.com|date=September 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Lowell missed weeks with a torn hip labrum, and after a blistering performance in June, J.D. Drew aggravated a back injury that shelved him for much of the second half of the season. Down the stretch, outfielder Manny Ramirez&amp;nbsp;— playing in the final year of his eight year contract&amp;nbsp;— became a distraction to the team. His disruptive behavior included public incidents with fellow players in the dugout (shoving Kevin Youkilis), team employees (pushing the team's 64 year old traveling secretary to the ground), criticizing ownership, and not playing due to laziness and nonexistent injuries. The front office decided to move the disgrunted outfielder at the July 31 trade deadline, shipping him to the Dodgers in a three-way deal with the Pirates that landed them [[Jason Bay]] to replace him in left field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shaughnessy|first=Dan|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/08/01/going_going_gone/|title=Going, going, gone|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KevinYouklis.jpg|thumb|left|200px|All Star [[Kevin Youkilis]]]]
With Ramirez gone, and Bay providing a new spark in the lineup, the Red Sox found new life. Kevin Youkilis had career highs in home runs (29) and RBIs (115). Closer Jonathan Papelbon set a career high in saves with 41. Daisuke Matsuzaka improved on his 2007 performance and led the team in wins, finishing with an 18–3 record. However, it was Dustin Pedroia who emerged as not only a team leader, but an American League MVP candidate. Pedroia hit over .340 in the second half, finishing the year at or near the top in the AL in batting average, hits, runs, and doubles. Despite Boston's 34–19 record following the trading deadline, the Rays held onto the AL East lead and captured their first division title in franchise history.

Boston still made the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. Behind the strong pitching of Jon Lester (two games started and no earned runs allowed), the Red Sox defeated the [[2008 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Angels]] in the [[2008 American League Division Series|ALDS]] three games to one. The Red Sox then took on their AL East rivals the [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] in the [[2008 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. Down three games to one in the 5th game of the ALCS, Boston mounted the greatest single game comeback in ALCS history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=281016102 |title=Drew's game-winning hit keeps Red Sox alive in ALCS |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=October 16, 2008 |accessdate=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trailing 7–0 in the 7th inning with elimination pending, the Red Sox came back to win the game 8–7.&lt;ref name=17alcs&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/sports/baseball/17alcs.html?_r=1&amp;ref=sports&amp;pagewanted=print|title=Down by 7–0, Red Sox Force a Game 6|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=October 17, 2008|first=Jack|last=Curry|authorlink=Jack Curry | date=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tied the series at 3 games apiece before losing Game 7, 3–1, thus becoming the eighth team in a row since 2000 not to repeat as world champions. The Red Sox led the American League last season in shutouts with 16, but only two were complete games by the starter.&lt;ref name=&quot;100random&quot; /&gt;

==Spring training==
{{Main|Boston Red Sox spring training home}}
[[File:RedSoxtraining.jpg|thumb|Red Sox logo on the fence outside City of Palms Park]]

===City of Palms Park===
Former [[left fielder]] [[Mike Greenwell]] is from [[Fort Myers, Florida]] and was instrumental in bringing his team to the city for [[spring training]]. [[City of Palms Park]] was built in {{by|1992}} for that purpose and holds 8,000 people. It is also the home of the Red Sox Rookie team, the [[Gulf Coast League Red Sox]], from April through June.

Perhaps the most memorable game played at City of Palms was on March 7, {{by|2004}}. This was the first game played between the Red Sox and [[New York Yankees]] since [[Aaron Boone]] hit the [[home run]] that eliminated the Red Sox from the playoffs the previous October. Boone's replacement at [[third base]], [[Alex Rodriguez]] was the high profile key acquisition of the off season for the Yankees, and he was savagely booed by the 7,304 in attendance.

===New spring facility===
The Red Sox's lease with Fort Myers runs through 2019, however, team ownership had been toying with exercising the early out in their contract that allows them to leave following the {{by|2009}} spring season. Chief operating officer Mike Dee met with [[Sarasota]] officials on April 25, 2008 to discuss the possibility of the Red Sox moving to Sarasota's [[Ed Smith Stadium]] once its current spring inhabitants, the [[Cincinnati Reds]], move to their new spring home in [[Goodyear, Arizona]].

John Yarborough, director of [[Lee County, Florida|Lee County]] Parks and Rec, met with Jeff Mudgett, a Fort Myers [[architect]] who is volunteering his time to brain storm ideas on what can be done to keep the Red Sox in Fort Myers. “I’d like to have a project by 2012,’’ Yarborough said after the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080723/SPORTS/807230402&amp;template=printart|title=Sarasota rejects one site for Red Sox|first=Glenn|last=Miller|publisher=Fort Myers News-Press|accessdate=July 14, 2008|date=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3–1 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County. Commissioner Brian Bigelow was the lone dissenting vote. Commissioner Bob Janes was not present for the vote, but stated that he supported it.

Dee was present in the chambers for the vote, and took the agreement back to Boston to meet with John Henry and other team officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008810280398|title=Lee County commissioners approve Red Sox agreement|accessdate=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 1, 2008, the Red Sox signed an agreement with Lee County that will keep their spring training home in the Fort Myers area for 30 more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/story/11076748|title=Red Sox to stay in Fort Myers for 30 more springs|accessdate=November 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wednesday, April 30, 2009, the Lee County commissioners selected the Watermen-Pinnacle site on Daniels Parkway (a little more than a mile east of Interstate 75) as the site for the new facility. The backup choice, if negotiations between county staff and the developer falter, is the University Highland site just north of [[Germain Arena]] in [[Estero]]. Jeff Mudgett, a Fort Myers [[architect]] who is volunteering his time toward the project, envisions a facility with a mini-[[Fenway Park]] that would open for Spring 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009904300348|title=Red Sox home in Lee County will be on Daniels Parkway|accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalry with the Yankees==

The rivalry is sometimes so polarizing that it is often a heated subject, like [[religion]] or [[politics]], in the [[Northeastern United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sox-Yankees rivalry led to attack, police say; Conn. man held in stabbing of fan from Nashua|first=Michele|last=Richinick|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=October 4, 2010|page=B2|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/10/04/sox_yankees_rivalry_led_to_attack_police_say/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the inception of the [[Major League Baseball Wild Card|wild card]] team and an added Division Series, the [[American League East]] rivals have squared off in the [[American League Championship Series]] three times, with the Yankees winning twice in [[1999 American League Championship Series|1999]] and [[2003 American League Championship Series|2003]] and the Sox winning in [[2004 American League Championship Series|2004]].&lt;ref name=ReverseCurse/&gt; In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in {{mlby|1904}} (when the Red Sox won) and {{mlby|1949}} (when the Yankees won).

The teams also finished tied for first in {{mlby|1978}}, when the Yankees won a high-profile [[1978 American League East tie-breaker game|one-game playoff]] for the division title.&lt;ref name=1918!/&gt;&lt;ref name=ReverseCurse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frommer/&gt; The 1978 division race is memorable for the Red Sox having held a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season.&lt;ref name=Frommer/&gt; Similarly, the 2004 AL Championship Series is notable for the Yankees leading 3 games to 0 and ultimately losing a best of seven series.&lt;ref name=Vaccaro/&gt; The Red Sox comeback was the only time in baseball history that a team has come back from a 0&amp;ndash;3 deficit to win a series.

The rivalry is often termed &quot;the best rivalry in sports.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nesn.com/2011/01/cubs-cardinals-must-emulate-yankees-red-sox-to-rekindle-rivalry.html|title=Cubs, Cardinals Must Emulate Yankees, Red Sox to Rekindle Rivalry|date=January 12, 2011|accessdate=February 6, 2011|first=Tony|last=Lee|work=NESN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games between the two teams are often broadcast on national television, schedule permitting, and have led to an increase in television ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yankees vs. Red Sox: Long-running drama|url=http://www.usatoday.com/SPORTS/usaedition/2010-05-07-yanksox07_cv_U.htm?csp=34|first=Jorge L.|last=Ortiz|newspaper=USA Today|date=May 7, 2010|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yankees &amp;mdash; Red Sox Games A Consistent Ratings Hit|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 25, 2004|page=D4|authorlink=Richard Sandomir}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UltimateRivalry/&gt;

==Radio and television==
{{See also|List of Boston Red Sox broadcasters}}
Currently, the [[flagship station|flagship]] [[radio station]] of the Red Sox is [[WEEI]], 850 AM. [[Joe Castiglione]], in his 25th year as the voice of the Red Sox, serves as the lead [[play-by-play]] announcer, along with [[Dave O'Brien]] and [[Jon Rish]]. Some of Castiglione's predecessors include [[Curt Gowdy]], [[Ken Coleman]], and [[Ned Martin]]. He has also worked with play-by-play veterans Bob Starr and [[Jerry Trupiano]]. Many stations throughout [[New England]] and beyond pick up the broadcasts.

All Red Sox telecasts not shown nationally on [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] or [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]] are seen on [[New England Sports Network]] (NESN) with [[Don Orsillo]] calling play-by-play and [[Jerry Remy]], former Red Sox [[second baseman]], as [[color analyst]]. During Remy's recovery from cancer, former Red Sox players [[Dennis Eckersley]] and [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] have alternated doing color commentary. NESN became exclusive in 2006; before then, games were shown on such local stations as [[WBZ-TV|WBZ]], [[WSBK-TV|WSBK]], [[WLVI-TV|WLVI]], [[WBPX|WABU]], and [[WFXT]] at various points in team history. Red Sox commercials have featured notable performers in thirty–second spots, including [[Jonathan Meath]] in 2009.

{{See also|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}
The most recent number retirement was on July 28, 2009, as the Red Sox retired the number 14 of Jim Rice.&lt;ref name=&quot;boston.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/extras/extra_bases/2009/07/sox_to_retire_r.html|title=Sox to retire Rice's number tonight|date=July 28, 2009|accessdate=August 31, 2009|first=Gary|last=Dzen|work=boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Sox have two official requirements for a player to have his number retired:
#Election to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]]
#At least 10 years played with the Red Sox&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/bos/history/retired_numbers.jsp|title=Retired Numbers from redsox.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Sox previously had a requirement that the player &quot;must have finished their career with Red Sox,&quot; but this was reconsidered after the election of Carlton Fisk to the Hall of Fame. Fisk actually retired with the White Sox, but then-GM Dan Duquette hired him for one day as a special assistant, which allowed Fisk to technically end his career with the Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Some would argue that the rule still exists ''de jure'', as Wade Boggs' number has not been retired by Boston even though he meets the official requirements (Boggs finished his career with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] after spending five years with the [[Yankees – Red Sox rivalry|rival]] [[New York Yankees]]). It should be noted that Boston did honor Boggs by voting him into the [[Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame|Red Sox Hall of Fame]] in 2004, the year before he was enshrined into Cooperstown.

The only exception that has been made to date is for former Boston shortstop [[Johnny Pesky]], whose number 6 was retired on September 28, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bostonherald.com/sports/baseball/red_sox/view/2008_09_29_Lofty_position_for_Johnny_Pesky:_Exclusive_place_for_Sox__No__6/srvc=home&amp;position=also|title=Lofty position for Johnny Pesky|date=September 29, 2008|first=Steve|last=Buckley|work=Boston Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pesky neither spent ten years as a player nor was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame; however, Red Sox ownership cited &quot;... his versatility of his contributions&amp;nbsp;— on the field, off the field, [and] in the dugout...,&quot; including as a manager, scout, and special instructor and decided that the honor had been well-earned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/09/24/pesky_makes_honor_roll?mode=PF|title=Pesky makes honor roll|date=September 24, 2008|work=Boston Globe|first=Michael|last=Vega}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number 42 was officially retired by [[Major League Baseball]] in {{by|1997}}, but [[Mo Vaughn]] was one of a handful of players to continue wearing #42 through a [[grandfather clause]]. He last wore it for the team in {{by|1998}}. In commemoration of Jackie Robinson Day, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 for games played on April 15, [[Coco Crisp]] (CF), [[David Ortiz]] (DH), and [[DeMarlo Hale]] (Coach) did that in 2007 and again in 2008. In 2009, MLB had all uniformed players for all teams wear #42 for Jackie Robinson Day.

[[File:Fenway retired numbers 2009.jpg|thumb|300px|Red Sox retired numbers as hung on the right-field facade in [[Fenway Park]]]]
Until the late 1990s, the numbers originally hung on the right-field facade in the order in which they were retired: 9–4–1–8. It was pointed out that the numbers, when read as a date (9/4/18), marked the eve of the first game of the [[1918 World Series]], the last championship series that the Red Sox won before 2004. After the facade was repainted, the numbers were rearranged in numerical order.

The Red Sox have not issued several numbers since the departure of prominent players who wore them,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redsoxdiehard.com/players/unifnums.html|title=Red Sox All-Time Uniform Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically:
&lt;ref name=&quot;boston.com&quot; /&gt;
* &amp;nbsp;5 – '''[[Nomar Garciaparra]] SS (1996–2004)'''; last played in 2009 for [[Oakland Athletics]]. [[Rocco Baldelli]] wore #5 in 2009 as he only had worn that number previously (as homage to [[Joe DiMaggio]]).
* 21 – '''[[Roger Clemens]] RHP (1984–1996)'''; last played in 2007 for [[New York Yankees]].
* 26 – '''[[Wade Boggs]] 3B (1982–1992)'''; Boggs has met the requirements based on his 11 years as a player and 2005 election into the Hall of Fame.  No announcement has been made, but #26 has not been issued since Boggs' 2005 election to the Hall of Fame (Several players wore #26 between 1992 and 2004)
* 38 – '''[[Curt Schilling]] RHP (2004–2007)'''; retired as member of Red Sox
* 45 – '''[[Pedro Martínez]] RHP (1998–2004)'''; last played in 2009 for [[Philadelphia Phillies]]
Neither Garciaparra, Schilling nor Martinez would qualify to have their uniform number retired based on the above &quot;10 year&quot; policy.

There is also considerable debate in Boston media circles and among fans about the potential retiring of [[Tony Conigliaro]]'s number '''25'''. Nonetheless, since Conigliaro's last full season in Boston, 1970, the number has been assigned to several players (including [[Orlando Cepeda]], [[Mark Clear]], [[Don Baylor]], [[Larry Parrish]], [[Jack Clark (baseball)|Jack Clark]], [[Troy O'Leary]], and [[Jeremy Giambi]]). The number 25 was last worn by third baseman [[Mike Lowell]] during the 2010 season. Coincidentally, Lowell was the winner of the [[Tony Conigliaro Award]] in 1999.

*David Ortiz in 2005 had 47 home runs and 148 RBIs.

*On April 22, 2007, Manny Ramírez, J.D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek hit four consecutive home runs in the 3rd inning off 10 pitches from [[Chase Wright]] of the New York Yankees in his second Major League start and his fourth above Single-A ball. This was the fifth time in Major League history, and first time in Red Sox history this feat has occurred. Notable is that J.D. Drew had previously contributed to a four consecutive home run sequence on September 18, 2006 (coincidentally also the second batter in the sequence) while with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Additionally, Red Sox manager Terry Francona's father, [[Tito Francona]], also was a part of such a four consecutive home run sequence for the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070422&amp;content_id=1925045&amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos|title=Sox tie mark with four straight homers &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; redsox.com: News|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On September 22, 2007, with a victory over the [[2007 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], the Red Sox clinched a spot in the postseason for the fourth time in five years, the first time in club history this has happened. Also, with this postseason berth, manager Terry Francona becomes the first manager in team history to lead the club to three playoff appearances.
*On September 8, 2008, the Red Sox set a Major League record with their 456th consecutive home-park sellout. The previous record had been held by the Cleveland Indians, who sold out 455 games between June 12, 1995 and April 2, 2001. The streak began on May 15, 2003 against the [[2003 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]]. The Red Sox are only the fourth team to sell out every home game of an entire season (the [[1996 Colorado Rockies season|1996 Colorado Rockies]] and the [[2000 San Francisco Giants season|2000 San Francisco Giants]] being the other two).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bostonherald.com/sports/baseball/red_sox/view/2008_09_04_Red_Sox_ties_sellout_streak:_Terry_Francona_a_big_fan_of_support/srvc=home&amp;position=also |title=Red Sox tie sellout streak|author=Jeff Horrigan for The Boston Herald |accessdate=September 7, 2008 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The team's definition of a sellout: &quot;The criteria used for a sellout at Fenway Park have been the same since the early 1990s,&quot; Kennedy said in an e-mail. &quot;Our policy is simple and straightforward, and is used by many MLB clubs &lt;nowiki&gt;[and other sports teams around the country]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

The '''Baltimore Orioles''' are a [[professional baseball|professional baseball team]] based in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] in the [[United States]]. They are a member of the [[American League East|Eastern Division]] of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[American League]]. One of the American League's eight charter franchises in 1901, it spent its first year as a major league club in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], as the '''Milwaukee Brewers''' before moving to [[St. Louis]] to become the '''St. Louis Browns'''. After 52 mostly hapless years in St. Louis, the Browns moved to Baltimore in {{Baseball Year|1954}} and adopted the Orioles name in honor of the [[Baltimore Oriole|official state bird of Maryland]]. The Orioles name had been used by previous major league baseball clubs in Baltimore, including the [[American League]] Baltimore Orioles franchise from 1901–1902 that became the [[New York Yankees]] and the National League Baltimore Orioles which won [[National League]] championships under Hall-of-Fame manager [[John McGraw]], before McGraw took the black and orange team colors to the New York Giants baseball team, which became the [[San Francisco Giants]] after the 1957 season. [[List of baseball nicknames|Nicknames]] for the team include the '''O's''' and the '''Birds.''' The Orioles have been best known for their successful stadium, the trend-setting [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], opened in 1992 near the birthplace of Babe Ruth.

The Orioles experienced their greatest success from 1964–1983, winning seven Divisional Championships (1969–1971, 1973–1974, 1979 and 1983), six pennants (1966, 1969–1971, 1979 and 1983), three World Championships (1966, 1970 and 1983), and five Most Valuable Player awards (3B [[Brooks Robinson]] 1964, OF [[Frank Robinson]] 1966, 1B [[Boog Powell]] 1970 and SS [[Cal Ripken Jr.]] 1983 and 1991).  The first World Series Championship team in 1966 was led by Hall-of-Famers [[Frank Robinson]] (OF), [[Brooks Robinson]] (3B), and [[Jim Palmer]] (P).  [[Frank Robinson]] won the 1966 World Series MVP award, as well as the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] in hitting, in which he led the American League in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in.  The second World Series Championship team in 1970 was led by the previous trio of Hall-of-Famers, Hall-of-Fame manager [[Earl Weaver]], and 1970 AL MVP Boog Powell (1B).  Brooks Robinson won the 1970 World Series MVP award.  The third World Championship team was led by Hall-of-Famers [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] (SS), [[Eddie Murray]] (1B), [[Jim Palmer]] (P) and 1983 World Series MVP [[Rick Dempsey]] (C).  The Orioles' success after 1983 included the following:  [[Frank Robinson]] won the American League manager of the year in 1989 managing the Orioles to a second-place finish in the AL East Division only two games behind the [[Toronto Blue Jays]];  [[Cal Ripken Jr.]] won the American League Most Valuable Player Award in 1991; the Orioles won their first American League Wild Card playoff appearance in 1996 and went wire-to-wire in winning the American League East Division championship in 1997, with [[Davey Johnson]] winning the American League Manager of the Year Award. Since the retirement of [[Cal Ripken Jr.]] in 2001, the Orioles have been in a downward spiral, compiling a losing record in every season since.

[[Image:MilwaukeeBrewers1889.jpg|left|thumb|The 1889 Milwaukee Brewers]]
The modern Orioles franchise can trace its roots back to the original Milwaukee Brewers of the [[minor league|minor]] [[Western League (U.S. baseball)|Western League]], beginning in 1894 when the league reorganized. The Brewers were there when the WL renamed itself the [[American League]] in [[1900 in baseball|1900]].

At the end of the 1900 season, the American League removed itself from baseball's National Agreement (the formal understanding between the NL and the minor leagues). Two months later, the AL declared itself a competing major league. As a result of several franchise shifts, the Brewers were one of only two Western League teams that didn't fold, move or get kicked out of the league (the other being the [[Detroit Tigers]]). In its first game in the American League, the team lost to the Detroit Tigers 14–13 after blowing a 10-run lead in the 9th inning. To this day, it is a major league record for the biggest deficit overcome that late in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/baseballs-biggest-ninth-inning-comebacks-385/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Baseball's Biggest Ninth-Inning Comebacks | first=Carl | last=Bialik | date=July 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first American League season in [[1901 in baseball|1901]], they finished last (8th place) with a record of 48–89. During its lone Major League season, the team played at [[Lloyd Street Grounds]], between 16th and 18th Streets in Milwaukee.

==St. Louis Browns==
[[File:StLouisBrowns.png|left|thumb|100px|St. Louis Browns Logo, circa 1936–1951]]
In 1902 the team moved to St. Louis, where it became the &quot;Browns&quot;, in reference to the original name of the 1880s club that by 1900 was known as the [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]]. A new park was built on the site of the old Browns' former home, [[Sportsman's Park]]. In their first St. Louis season, the Browns finished second. Although the Browns usually fielded terrible or mediocre teams (they had only four winning seasons from 1902 to 1922), they were very popular at the gate during their first two decades in St. Louis, and trounced the Cardinals in attendance. In {{Baseball Year|1909}}, the Browns rebuilt Sportsman's Park as the third concrete-and-steel park in the majors.

During this time, the Browns were best-known for their role in the race for the 1910 [[1910 Chalmers Award|American League batting title]]. [[Ty Cobb]] took the last game of the season off, believing that his slight lead over [[Nap Lajoie]] would hold up unless Lajoie had a near-perfect day at the plate. However, Cobb was one of the most despised players in baseball, and Browns [[catcher]]-[[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Jack O'Connor (catcher)|Jack O'Connor]] ordered [[third baseman]] [[Red Corriden]] to station himself in shallow [[left field]] for the season-ending doubleheader between the Browns and the [[Cleveland Naps]]. Lajoie [[Bunt (baseball)|bunted]] five straight times down the third base line and made it to first easily. On his last at-bat, Lajoie reached base on an error&amp;nbsp;– officially giving him a hitless at-bat. O'Connor and coach Harry Howell tried to bribe the official scorer, a woman, to change the call to a hit&amp;nbsp;– even offering to buy her a new wardrobe. Cobb won the batting title by just a few thousandths of a point over Lajoie (though it later emerged that one game may have been counted twice in the statistics). The resulting outcry triggered an investigation by American League president [[Ban Johnson]]. At his insistence, Browns owner Robert Lee Hedges&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;bid=1548&amp;pid=19110 BIOPROJ.SABR.ORG :: The Baseball Biography Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; fired O'Connor and Howell; both men were informally banned from baseball for life.

In [[1916 Major League Baseball season|1916]], Hedges sold the Browns to Philip DeCatesby Ball, who owned the [[St. Louis Terriers]] in the by-then-defunct [[Federal League]]. Four years later, Ball allowed the Cardinals to move out of dilapidated [[Robison Field]] and share Sportsman's Park with the Browns. This move was one of many that eventually doomed the Browns; Cardinals owner [[Sam Breadon]] and [[General Manager (baseball)|General Manager]] [[Branch Rickey]] (a former Browns manager) used the proceeds from the Robison Field sale to build baseball's first modern [[farm system]]. This effort eventually produced several star players that brought the Cardinals more drawing power than the Browns.

The [[1922 St. Louis Browns season|1922 Browns]] excited their owner by almost beating the [[1922 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] to a pennant. The club was boasting the best players in franchise history, including future Hall of Famer [[George Sisler]] and an outfield trio of [[Ken Williams (baseball)|Ken Williams]], [[Baby Doll Jacobson]], and [[Jack Tobin]] that batted .300 or better from 1919–23 and in 1925. In 1922, Williams became the first player in Major League history to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in a season, something that would not be done again in the Majors until [[1956 Major League Baseball season|1956]].

Ball confidently predicted that there would be a [[World Series]] in Sportsman's Park by [[1926 Major League Baseball season|1926]]. In anticipation, he increased the capacity of his ballpark from 18,000 to 30,000. Ball was right, as there was a World Series in Sportsman's Park in [[1926 Major League Baseball season|1926]]&amp;nbsp;– the [[1926 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] upset the [[1926 New York Yankees season|Yankees]]. St. Louis had been considered a &quot;Browns town&quot; until then; after their [[1926 World Series|1926 series]] victory, however, the Cardinals dominated St. Louis baseball while still technically tenants of the Browns. Meanwhile, the Browns rapidly fell into the cellar.

===War era===
&lt;!-- COMMENT UNTIL THIS CAN BE RESEARCHED In 1941, the Browns asked AL owners for permission to move to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] for the 1942 season, and got tentative approval from the league. A schedule was even drawn up including Los Angeles, and the move was expected to win final approval at a league meeting on [[December 8]]. However, the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]] a day earlier resulted in it never coming to a vote.{{fact|date=May 2008}} --&gt;

During the war, the Browns won their only St. Louis-based American League pennant, in 1944. Some critics called it a fluke, as most major league stars voluntarily joined or were drafted into the military; however, many of the Browns' best players were classified [[4F (military conscription)|4-F]]: unfit for military service. They faced their local rivals, the incredibly successful [[1944 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]], in the [[1944 World Series]], the last World Series to date played entirely in one stadium. However, the Browns lost the series in six games.

In [[1945 Major League Baseball season|1945]], the [[1945 St. Louis Browns season|Browns]] posted an 81–75 record and fell to third place, six games out, again with less than top-ranked talent. The 1945 season may be best remembered for the Browns' signing of utility outfielder [[Pete Gray]], the only one-armed major league position player in history. The 1945 season proved to be the Browns' last hurrah; they would never have another winning season in St. Louis. In fact, 1944 and 1945 were two of only eight winning seasons they enjoyed in the 31 years after nearly winning the pennant in 1922.

===Veeck era===
In [[1951 Major League Baseball season|1951]], [[Bill Veeck]], the colorful former owner of the [[Cleveland Indians]], purchased the Browns. In St. Louis, he extended the promotions and wild antics that had made him famous and loved by many and loathed by many others. His most notorious stunt in St. Louis came on August 19, 1951, when he sent [[Eddie Gaedel]], a 3-foot 7-inch, 65-pound [[midget]], to bat as a [[pinch hitter]]. When Gaedel stepped to the plate he was wearing a Browns uniform with the number 1/8. With no [[strike zone]] to speak of, Gaedel [[walk (baseball)|walked]] on four straight pitches, as he was ordered not to swing at any pitch. The stunt infuriated American League President [[Will Harridge]], who voided Gaedel's contract the next day.

After the 1951 season, Veeck made [[Ned Garver]] the highest-paid member of the Browns. Garver remains the last pitcher to win 20 games for a team that lost 100 games in a season.  He was the second pitcher in history to accomplish the feat.

Veeck also brought [[Satchel Paige]] back to major league baseball to pitch for the Browns. Veeck had previously signed the former [[Negro League]] great to a contract in Cleveland in 1948 at age 42, amid much criticism. At 45, Paige's re-appearance in a Browns uniform did nothing to win Veeck friends among baseball's owners. Nonetheless, Paige ended the season with a respectable 3–4 record and a 4.79 ERA.

Veeck believed that St. Louis was too small for two franchises and planned to drive the Cardinals out of town. He signed many of the Cardinals' most popular ex-players and, as a result, attracted many Cards fans to see the Browns. Notably, Veeck inked former Cardinals great [[Dizzy Dean]] to a broadcasting contract and tapped [[Rogers Hornsby]] as manager. He also re-acquired former Browns fan favorite [[Vern Stephens]] and signed former Cardinals pitcher [[Harry Brecheen]], both of whom had starred in the all-St. Louis World Series in 1944. Veeck also stripped Sportsman's Park of any Cardinals material and dressed it exclusively in Browns memorabilia, even moving his family to an apartment under the stands. Although the Browns fielded consisently losing teams during this time, Veeck's showmanship and colorful promotions made attendance at Browns games more fun and unpredictable than the conservative Cardinals were willing to offer.

Veeck's all-out assault on the Cardinals came during a downturn in the Cardinals' fortunes after Rickey left them for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] in [[1942 Major League Baseball season|1942]]. Indeed, when Cardinals' owner [[Fred Saigh]] was convicted of massive [[tax evasion]] late in 1952, it looked almost certain that the Cardinals were leaving town, as most of the top bids came from non-St. Louis interests. However, Saigh accepted a much lower bid from [[Anheuser-Busch]], whose president [[August Busch, Jr.]] immediately announced that he had no intention of moving the Cardinals. Veeck quickly realized the Cardinals now had more resources than he could ever hope to match and decided to move the Browns.

Veeck attempted to move the Browns back to Milwaukee (where he had owned the [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|Brewers]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] in the 1940s), but the move was blocked by the other American League owners, seemingly for reasons that were more personal than business-related. An undaunted Veeck then tried to move the Browns to Baltimore, but was again rebuffed by the owners, still seething at the publicity stunts he had pulled at Browns home games. Meanwhile, Sportsman's Park had slipped into disrepair, and Veeck was forced to sell it to the Cardinals since he could not afford to make the necessary improvements to bring it up to code. With his only leverage gone and facing threats of the liquidation of his franchise, Veeck was all but forced to sell the Browns to a group of Baltimore-based investors led by [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] [[Clarence Miles]]. With Veeck &quot;out of the way&quot;, the American League owners quickly approved the relocation of the team to Baltimore for the 1954 season on September 29, 1953. Miles became the franchise's [[chairman]] of the [[board of directors|board]] and [[president]].

===Legacy===
Unlike other clubs that had relocated in the 1950s, retaining their nickname and a sense of continuity with their past (such as the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[San Francisco Giants|New York/San Francisco Giants]], [[Atlanta Braves|Boston/Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves]], and [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia/Kansas City/Oakland Athletics]]), the St. Louis Browns were renamed the '''Baltimore Orioles''' upon their transfer, implicitly distancing themselves at least somewhat from their history. It was also unique in that, unlike the other teams, the Browns/Orioles moved eastward instead of westward geographically. In December 1954, the Orioles further distanced themselves from their Browns past by making a 17-player trade with the [[New York Yankees]] that included most former Browns of note still on the Baltimore roster. Though the deal did little to improve the short-term competitiveness of the club, it helped establish a fresh identity for the Orioles franchise. To this day, the Orioles make almost no mention of their past as the Browns.

The Orioles finally cut the last ties to the Browns era in August 1979. In 1936, the Browns sold 20,000 shares of stock to the public at $5 a share—an unusual practice for a sports franchise even today. In 1979, new owner [[Edward Bennett Williams]] bought back those shares, making the franchise privately held once again. Although the buyout price is not known, it is assumed that given the Orioles' prosperity over their then 25 years in Baltimore, the owners made a handsome return on their investment.

The Browns, along with the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]], were mostly associated with losing, as both franchises seemed to be the American League's perennial doormats. The Senators became the butt of a well-known [[vaudeville]] joke, &quot;First in war, first in peace, and last in the American League&quot; (a twist on the famous [[Henry Lee III|&quot;Light Horse Harry&quot; Lee]] eulogy for [[George Washington]]: &quot;First in war, first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen&quot;). A spin-off joke was coined for the Browns: &quot;First in [[Brown Shoe Company|shoes]], first in [[Anheuser-Busch|booze]], and last in the American League.&quot;

Many older fans in St. Louis remember the Browns fondly, and some have formed societies to keep the memory of the team alive; it is not uncommon to see sporting goods stores in the St. Louis area stock Browns shirts and hats. The club was in St. Louis for 52 years. The club has now been in Baltimore longer than it was in St. Louis.

Believed to be the oldest former major leaguer, the Browns' [[Rollie Stiles]], 100, died July 22, 2007, in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicbaseball.com/players/s/stilles_rolle.html Rolle Stiles : Former Brown dies at 100].

==Baltimore Orioles==
[[File:Orioles Mascot.jpg|thumb|right]]
As mentioned above, the Miles-Hofberger group renamed their new team the Baltimore Orioles soon after taking control of the franchise. The name has a rich history in Baltimore, having been used by Baltimore baseball teams since the late 19th century.

In the 1890s, a powerful and innovative [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|National League Orioles]] squad included several future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]], such as [[Willie Keeler|&quot;Wee&quot; Willie Keeler]], [[Wilbert Robinson]], [[Hughie Jennings]], and [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]]. They won three straight pennants, and participated in all four of the [[Temple Cup]] Championship Series, winning the last two of them. That team had started as a charter member of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in 1882. Despite its on-field success, it was one of the four teams contracted out of existence by the National League after the 1899 season. Its best players (and its manager, [[Ned Hanlon (baseball)|Ned Hanlon]]) regrouped with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]], turning that team into a contender.

In 1901, Baltimore and McGraw were awarded an expansion franchise in the growing American League, but again the team was sacrificed in favor of a [[New York City]] franchise, as the team was transferred to New York in 1903. After some early struggles, that team eventually became baseball's most successful franchise&amp;nbsp;— the [[New York Yankees]].

As a member of the high-minor league level [[International League]], the Orioles competed at what is now known as the AAA level from 1903–1953. Baltimore's own [[Babe Ruth]] pitched for the Orioles before being sold to the AL [[Boston Red Sox]] in 1914. The Orioles of the IL won nine league championships, first in 1908, followed by a lengthy run from 1919 to 1925, and then dramatically in 1944, after they had lost their home field [[Oriole Park]] in a disastrous mid-season fire. The huge post-season crowds at their temporary home, [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Municipal Stadium]], caught the attention of the big league brass and helped open the door to the return of major league baseball to Baltimore. Thanks to the big stadium, that &quot;Junior World Series&quot; easily outdrew the major league World Series which, coincidentally, included the team that would move to Baltimore ten years later and take up occupancy in the rebuilt version of the big stadium.

===Seeds of success (1954–59)===
After starting the [[1954 Major League Baseball season|1954 campaign]] with a two-game split against the [[1954 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]] in [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Detroit]], the [[1954 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] returned to Baltimore on April 15 to a welcoming [[parade]] that wound through the streets of downtown, with an estimated 350,000 spectators lining the route. In its first-ever home opener at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] later in the afternoon, they treated a sellout crowd of 46,354 to a 3–1 victory over the [[1954 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]]. The remainder of the season would not be as pleasant, with the team enduring 100 losses while avoiding the AL cellar by only three games. With fellow investors both frustrated with his domination of the franchise's business operations and dissatisfied with yet another seventh- place finish, Clarence Miles resigned in early November 1955. [[Real estate development|Real estate developer]] [[James Keelty|James Keelty Jr.]] succeeded him as president with [[investment banking|investment banker]] [[Joseph Iglehart]] the new board chairman.

The seeds of long-term success were planted on September 14, 1954, when the Orioles hired [[Paul Richards (baseball)|Paul Richards]] to become the ballclub's manager and general manager. He laid the foundation for what would years later be called the '''''Oriole Way'''''. The instruction of baseball fundamentals became uniform in every detail between all classes within the organization. Players were patiently refined until fundamentally sound instead of being hastily advanced to the next level.

For the remainder of the 1950s, the Orioles crawled up the standings, reaching as high as fifth place with a [[1957 Baltimore Orioles season|76–76]] record in [[1957 Major League Baseball season|1957]]. Richards succeeded in stocking the franchise with a plethora of young talent which included [[Dave Nicholson]], [[Pete Ward]], [[Ron Hansen (baseball)|Ron Hansen]] (1960 AL [[Rookie of the Year (award)|Rookie of the Year]]), [[Milt Pappas]], [[Jerry Adair]], [[Steve Barber]] (20 wins in 1963), [[Boog Powell]], [[Dave McNally]] and [[Brooks Robinson]]. Unfortunately, Richards also had the tendency to recklessly spend money on individuals with dubious baseball skills. This became a major problem as bidding wars between the ballclubs to land the best [[amateur sports|amateur]] players escalated [[signing bonus]]es.

The solution came on November 5, 1958, when [[Lee MacPhail]] was appointed general manager, allowing Richards to focus on his managerial duties. MacPhail added much needed discipline to the [[scout (sport)|scouting]] staff by establishing cross-checkers who thoroughly evaluated young hopefuls to determine whether they were worthy of being tendered a [[contract]]. He also accepted the title of president after Keelty resigned in mid-December, 1959.

===Pennant contenders (1960–65)===
One month prior to the end of the [[1961 Major League Baseball season|1961 season]], Richards resigned as the team's skipper to become the general manager of the [[expansion team|expansion]] [[Houston Astros|Houston Colt 45s]]. A [[1960 Major League Baseball season|year earlier]], he succeeded in establishing the [[1960 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] as a legitimate contender when they stood atop the AL standings as late as early September before finishing in second place at 89–65.

In [[1964 Major League Baseball season|1964]], the [[1964 Baltimore Orioles season|Birds]], piloted by [[Hank Bauer]] in his first year of managing the ballclub, were involved in a tight [[pennant (sports)|pennant]] race against the [[1964 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] and [[1964 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]]. They ended up in third with a 97–65 record, only two games out. It has been suggested that they would likely have advanced to the [[1964 World Series|Fall Classic]] had it not been for a minor [[wrist]] injury that sidelined Powell for two weeks in late August.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam, David. ''October 1964''. New York: Villard Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Robinson enjoyed a breakout season with a league-high 118 [[run batted in|runs batted in (RBI)]] and won the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|AL Most Valuable Player Award]].

[[CBS]]' purchase of a majority stake in the Yankees on September 9 of that same year resulted in a change to the ownership situation in Baltimore. Iglehart, the Orioles' largest shareholder at 32% and owner of a sizable amount of CBS stock, straightened out his [[conflict of interest]] issues on May 25, 1965 by selling his 64,000 shares in the ballclub to the [[National Bohemian|National Brewing Company]], an original team investor which finally had controlling interest at 65%. Brewery president [[Jerold Hoffberger]] became the Orioles' new chairman of the board.

With the benefit of a deep talent pool and superior scouts, the franchise continued to make improvements at the major league level. Three months before the start of the [[1963 Major League Baseball season|1963 season]], the [[1963 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] stabilized its infield by acquiring [[Luis Aparicio]] in a transaction that involved sending a trio of homegrown players (Hansen, Nicholson and Ward) to the White Sox. They also scoured the [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]] for selections in the [[Rule 5 draft]] ([[Paul Blair (baseball)|Paul Blair]] from the [[New York Mets|Mets]] in [[1962 Major League Baseball season|1962]], [[Moe Drabowsky]] from the Cardinals in 1965) and claims off [[Major League Baseball transactions|waivers]] ([[Curt Blefary]], 1965 AL Rookie of the Year, from the Yankees in 1963).

===Milt Pappas for Frank Robinson===
On December 9, 1965, the Orioles traded pitcher [[Milt Pappas]] (and several others) to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in exchange for slugging outfielder [[Frank Robinson]]. The following year, Robinson won the American League Most Valuable Player award, thus becoming the first (and so far only) man to win the MVP in each league (Robinson won the NL MVP in 1961, leading the Reds to the pennant). In addition to winning the 1966 MVP, Robinson also won the [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] (leading the American League in [[batting average]], [[home run]]s, and [[runs batted in]]), a feat also achieved the following season by [[Boston Red Sox|Boston's]] [[Carl Yastrzemski]] but never since. The [[1966 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] won their first-ever American League championship in [[1966 Major League Baseball season|1966]], and in a major upset, swept the [[1966 World Series|World Series]] by out-dueling the Los Angeles Dodgers aces [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Don Drysdale]]. The only home run ball ever hit completely out of Memorial Stadium was slugged by Robinson on Mother's Day in 1966, off [[1966 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] pitcher [[Luis Tiant]]. It cleared the left field single-deck portion of the grandstand. A flag was later erected near the spot the ball cleared the back wall, with simply the word &quot;HERE&quot; upon it. The flag is now in the Baltimore Orioles museum.

Pappas went 30–29 in a little over two years with the Reds before being traded. Although he would go on to have back-to-back 17-win seasons for the [[Chicago Cubs]] in 1971 and 1972, including a [[no-hitter]] in the latter season, this did not help the [[1970 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]], who ended up losing the [[1970 World Series]] to Robinson and the Orioles. This trade has become renowned as one of the most lopsided in baseball history, including a mention by [[Susan Sarandon]] in her opening soliloquy in the 1988 film ''[[Bull Durham]]'': &quot;Bad trades are a part of baseball. I mean, who can forget Frank Robinson for Milt Pappas?&quot;

===Glory Years (1966–1985)===
In the 1960s, the Orioles farm system produced an especially large number of high-quality players and coaches and laid the foundation for two decades of on-field success. This period included eighteen consecutive winning seasons (1968–1985) -- an unprecedented run of success that saw the Orioles become the envy of the league, and the winningest team in baseball.

During this period, the Orioles played baseball the '''''Oriole Way''''', an organizational ethic best described by longtime farm hand and coach [[Cal Ripken, Sr.]]'s phrase ''&quot;'''perfect''' practice makes perfect!&quot;'' The ''Oriole Way'' was a belief that hard work, professionalism, and a strong understanding of fundamentals were the keys to success at the major league level. It was based on the belief that if every coach, at every level, taught the game the same way, the organization could produce &quot;replacement parts&quot; that could be substituted seamlessly into the big league club with little or no adjustment. Elaborations on the Oriole way include pitching coach and manager Ray Miller's maxim &quot;Work fast, change speeds, and throw strikes&quot; and manager Earl Weaver's maxim &quot;Pitching, defense and three-run homers.&quot;

The ''Oriole Way'' began flourishing in 1966 after the Robinson-for-Pappas deal, as Robinson won the Triple Crown Award. His Orioles would easily sweep the [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[1966 World Series]]. After a mediocre [[1967 Baltimore Orioles season|1967 season]], [[Hank Bauer]] would be replaced by [[Earl Weaver]] halfway into [[1968 Major League Baseball season|1968]]. The [[1968 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] would finish second in the American League. This would only be a prelude to [[1969 Major League Baseball season|1969]], when the [[1969 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] won 109 games and easily won the newly-created [[American League East]] division title. [[Mike Cuellar]] shared the Cy Young Award with Detroit's [[Denny McLain]]. After sweeping [[1969 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota]] in the [[1969 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]], Baltimore was shocked by losing to the [[1969 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] in a five-game [[1969 World Series|World Series]]. The next year, [[Boog Powell]] won the MVP and the Orioles won another 108 games. After sweeping the [[1970 Minnesota Twins season|Twins]] once again in the [[1970 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], the Orioles won the [[1970 World Series]] by defeating the [[1970 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]]' [[Big Red Machine]] in five games.

In [[1971 Major League Baseball season|1971]], the [[1971 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] won another division title thanks to  four 20-game winners on their pitching staff (Cuellar, [[Jim Palmer]], [[Pat Dobson]], and [[Dave McNally]]). After defeating the young [[1971 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] in the [[1971 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], the Orioles would lose a heartbreaking seven-game [[1971 World Series|World Series]] to the [[1971 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]]. The [[1972 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] would miss the playoffs in [[1972 Major League Baseball season|1972]], but rebounded to win the division in 1973 and 1974. Each time, they would lose to Oakland in the ALCS. During this stretch, the Orioles began to phase out their veteran infield by replacing [[Davey Johnson]] and [[Brooks Robinson]] with younger stars [[Bobby Grich]] and [[Doug DeCinces]], respectively. Johnson would be dealt along with [[Johnny Oates]] to the [[Atlanta Braves]] for catcher and 1971 National League Rookie of the Year [[Earl Williams (1970s catcher)|Earl Williams]]. Although Williams would hit 63 home runs in two seasons with Atlanta, he would only hit 36 homers in two seasons with the Orioles.

In [[1975 Major League Baseball season|1975]], the Birds acquired slugger [[Lee May]] in a trade with Houston, and traded [[Dave McNally]], [[Rich Coggins]] and minor-league pitcher Bill Kirkpatrick to Montreal for star outfielder [[Ken Singleton]], and future 20-game winner [[Mike Torrez]]. Jim Palmer won the Cy Young Award, but the [[1975 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] lost the division title to the [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] and their mega-rookies [[Fred Lynn]] and [[Jim Rice]]. The [[1976 Major League Baseball season|1976]] season brought [[Reggie Jackson]] and [[Ken Holtzman]] from a trade with Oakland, but the [[1976 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] only won 88 games. It was this season when the Orioles made a trade that brought them players such as [[Tippy Martinez]] and [[Rick Dempsey]]. This young foundation, along with the departures of the unhappy Jackson and Holtzman, would create the basis for [[1977 Major League Baseball season|1977]]. The [[1977 Baltimore Orioles season|&quot;No Name Orioles&quot;]], along with Rookie of the Year [[Eddie Murray]], won 97 games and finished tied for second place with Boston. After finishing fourth in [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978]], the [[1979 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] finally won the division in [[1979 Major League Baseball season|1979]] thanks to strong play from [[Ken Singleton]] and Cy Young Winner [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]]. The Orioles defeated the [[1979 California Angels season|Angels]] in the [[1979 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], but lost to [[1979 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh]] in another [[1979 World Series|stunning World Series]]. This started a short period of heartbreak for Baltimore that would nevertheless culminate in a championship.

The [[1980 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] won 100 games in [[1980 Major League Baseball season|1980]] thanks to Cy Young Winner [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]], but the Yankees won 103 games. Although Baltimore had the best overall record in the AL East in 1981, they finished second in each half. As a result, they were out of the playoffs. The 1982 campaign saw Baltimore eliminated on the final weekend of the season by the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. [[Earl Weaver]] retired and [[Joe Altobelli]] took over for [[1983 Major League Baseball season|1983]]. Altobelli would lead the Orioles to 98 wins and a division title thanks to MVP [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]]. The Orioles defeated the [[1983 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[1983 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] thanks to a 10th-inning homer by [[Tito Landrum]] in the deciding game. The Orioles won the World Series in five games by defeating the [[1983 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]].

During their most productive years, the Orioles saw three of its players named MVP: ([[Frank Robinson]] in 1966; [[Boog Powell]] in 1970; and [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] in 1983). Additionally, [[Brooks Robinson]] was named Most Valuable Player in 1964, just two years before the 1966–1983 golden era began.  The pitching staff was phenomenal, with four pitchers winning six [[Cy Young Award]]s (Mike Cuellar in 1969; Jim Palmer in 1973, 1975, and 1976; Mike Flanagan in 1979; and [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] in 1980). In 1971, the team's four starting pitchers, McNally, Cuellar, Palmer, and [[Pat Dobson]], all won 20 games, a feat that has not been replicated. In that year, the Birds went on to post a 101–61 record for their third-straight AL East title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/al/baltios/orioles.html Baltimore Orioles (1954–Present)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Also during this stretch three players were named [[American League Rookie of the Year|rookies of the year]]: [[Al Bumbry]] (1973); Eddie Murray (1977); and Cal Ripken, Jr. (1982).  One might date the glory years of the Orioles dating back to 1964, which would include two 3rd-place seasons, 1964–1965, in which the Orioles won 97 and 94 games, respectively, and a year in which third-baseman [[Brooks Robinson]] won his Most Valuable Player Award (1964).  The glory years of the Orioles effectively ended when the Detroit Tigers, a divisional rival at the time, went 35–5 to open the 1984 season on the way to winning the World Series, and when Hall-of-Fame pitcher [[Jim Palmer]] retired during the 1984 season.

===Final seasons at Memorial Stadium (1984–1991)===
After winning the [[1983 World Series]], the Orioles spent the next five years in steady decline, finishing [[1986 Major League Baseball season|1986]] in last place for the first time since the franchise moved to Baltimore. The [[1988 Baltimore Orioles season|team]] hit bottom in [[1988 Major League Baseball season|1988]] when it started the season 0–21, en route to 107 losses and the worst record in the majors that year. The Orioles surprised the baseball world the following year by spending most of the summer in first place until September when the [[1989 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] overtook them and seized the A.L. East title on the final weekend of the regular season. The next two years were spent below the .500 mark, highlighted only by Cal Ripken, Jr. winning his second [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|A.L. MVP Award]] in [[1991 Major League Baseball season|1991]]. The [[1991 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] bade farewell to Memorial Stadium, the team's home for 38 years, at the end of the 1991 campaign.

===Camden Yards opens (1992–93)===
{{main|1992 Baltimore Orioles season|1993 Baltimore Orioles season}}
Opening to much fanfare in 1992, [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] was an instant success, spawning other retro-designed major league ballparks within the next two decades. The stadium became the site of the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1993 All-Star Game]]. The Orioles returned to contention in those first two seasons at Camden Yards, only to finish in third place both times. Also in 1993, with then-owner [[Eli Jacobs]] forced to divest himself of the franchise, Baltimore-based [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] [[Peter Angelos]] was awarded the Orioles in [[United States bankruptcy court|bankruptcy court]], returning the team to local ownership for the first time since 1979.

===Strike year (1994)===
{{main|1994 Baltimore Orioles season}}
After the 1993 season, the Orioles acquired first baseman [[Rafael Palmeiro]] from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. The Orioles, who spent all of [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994]] chasing the [[1994 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], occupied second place in the new five-team AL East when the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|players strike]], which began on August 11, forced the eventual cancellation of the season.

===Ripken breaks the streak (1995)===
{{main|1995 Baltimore Orioles season}}
The labor impasse would continue into the spring of [[1995 Major League Baseball season|1995]]. Almost all of the major league clubs held [[spring training]] using [[strikebreaker|replacement players]], with the intention of beginning the [[1995 Major League Baseball season|season]] with them. The Orioles, whose owner was a [[trade union|labor union]] [[lawyer]], were the lone dissenters against creating an ersatz team, choosing instead to sit out spring training and possibly the entire season. Had they fielded a substitute team, [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]]'s consecutive games streak would have been jeopardized. The replacements questions became moot when the strike was finally settled.

The Ripken countdown resumed once the season began. Ripken finally broke [[Lou Gehrig]]'s consecutive games streak of 2,130 games in a nationally televised game on September 6. This was later voted the all-time baseball moment of the 20th century by fans from around the country in 1999. Ripken finished his streak with 2,632 straight games, finally sitting on September 20, 1998, against the [[1998 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] at Camden Yards.

The Orioles finished two games under .500 in third place in [[Phil Regan (baseball)|Phil Regan]]'s only season of managing the ballclub.

===Playoff years (1996–97)===
====1996 season====
{{main|1996 Baltimore Orioles season}}
Before the [[1996 Major League Baseball season|1996 season]], Angelos hired [[Pat Gillick]] as general manager. Given the green light to spend heavily on established talent, Gillick signed several premium players like [[B.J. Surhoff]], [[Randy Myers]], [[David Wells]] and [[Roberto Alomar]]. Under new manager [[Davey Johnson]] and on the strength of a then-major league record 257 [[home run]]s in a single season, the Orioles returned to the playoffs after a twelve-year absence by clinching the A.L. [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] berth. Alomar set off a firestorm in September when he spat into [[home plate]] umpire [[John Hirschbeck]]'s face during an argument in Toronto. He was later suspended for the first five games of the 1997 season, even though most wanted him banned from the postseason. After dethroning the defending A.L. Champion [[1996 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] 3–1 in the [[1996 American League Division Series|Division Series]], the Orioles fell to the [[1996 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] 4–1 in an [[1996 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] infamous for [[right fielder|right field]] umpire [[Rich Garcia]]'s failure to call fan interference, when Yankee fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the outfield wall to catch an in-play hit which was clearly on its path to being caught by right fielder Tony Tarasco.  This failed call was largely blamed for changing the momentum of the series and granting the Yankees another questionable win.

====1997 season====
{{main|1997 Baltimore Orioles season}}
The Orioles went &quot;wire-to-wire&quot; (first place from start to finish) in winning the [[American League East|A.L. East]] title in 1997. After eliminating the [[1997 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] 3–1 in the [[1997 American League Division Series|Division Series]], the team lost again in the [[1997 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], this time to the underdog [[1997 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]] 4–2, with each Oriole loss by only a run. Johnson resigned as manager after the season, largely due to a spat with Angelos concerning Alomar's [[fine (penalty)|fine]] for missing a team function being donated to Johnson's wife's [[charitable organization|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/orioles/longterm/memories/davey/articles/poorcomm.htm | work=The Washington Post|title=Poor Communication at Heart of Feud  | date=May 12, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[coach (baseball)|Pitching coach]] [[Ray Miller (baseball manager)|Ray Miller]] replaced Johnson.

===Beginning of a downturn (1998–99)===
====1998 season====
{{main|1998 Baltimore Orioles season}}
With Miller at the helm, the Orioles found themselves not only out of the playoffs, but also with a losing season. When Gillick's contract expired in 1998, it was not renewed. Angelos brought in [[Frank Wren]] to take over as GM. The Orioles added volatile slugger [[Albert Belle]], but the team's woes continued in the 1999 season, with stars like [[Rafael Palmeiro]], [[Roberto Alomar]], and [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] leaving in free agency. After a second straight losing season, Angelos fired both Miller and Wren. He named [[Syd Thrift]] the new GM and brought in former Cleveland manager [[Mike Hargrove]].

====1999 season====
{{main|1999 Baltimore Orioles season}}
[[File:Baltimore Orioles.svg|150px|left|thumb|Logo from 1999–2008.]]In a rare event on March 28, 1999, the Orioles staged an exhibition game against the [[Cuba national baseball team|Cuban national team]] in [[Havana]]. The Orioles won the game 3–2 in 11 innings. They were the first Major League team to play in Cuba since 1959, when the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] faced the Orioles in an exhibition. The game was part of a two-game series, in which the Cuban team visited [[Baltimore]] in May 1999. Cuba won the second game 10–6.

===Recent history: Post-Ripken Era &amp; Downfall (2000–present)===
[[File:CamdenYards 2005-05-08.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]]]]
{{main|2000 Baltimore Orioles season}}
Cal Ripken, Jr. achieved his 3000th hit early in the season.  A [[fire sale]] occurred late in the season, where the Orioles traded away many veterans for unproven young players and minor league prospects.  The Orioles called up many of their AAA players to finish the season.  The only acquired player that would have a long-term career with the organization was [[Melvin Mora]].
{{main|2001 Baltimore Orioles season}}
This was Cal Ripken, Jr.'s final season. His number (8) was retired in a ceremony before the final home game of the season.
{{main|2002 Baltimore Orioles season}}

====2003–04 seasons====
{{main|2003 Baltimore Orioles season|2004 Baltimore Orioles season}}
In an effort to right the Orioles' sinking ship, changes began to sweep through the organization in {{mlby|2003}}. General manager [[Syd Thrift]] was fired and to replace him, the Orioles hired [[Jim Beattie]] as executive vice-president and [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]] as the vice president of baseball operations. After another losing season, manager [[Mike Hargrove]] was not retained and Yankees coach [[Lee Mazzilli]] was brought in as the new manager. The team signed powerful hitters in SS [[Miguel Tejada]], C [[Javy López]], and former Oriole 1B [[Rafael Palmeiro]]. The following season, the Orioles traded for OF [[Sammy Sosa]].

====2005 season====
{{main|2005 Baltimore Orioles season}}
The team got hot early in [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]] and jumped out in front of the AL East division, holding onto first place for 62 straight days. However, turmoil on and off the field began to take its toll as the Orioles started struggling around the All-Star break, dropping them close to the surging [[2005 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] and [[2005 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]]. Injuries to Lopez, Sosa, [[Luis Matos]], [[Brian Roberts]], and [[Larry Bigbie]] came within weeks of each other, and the team grew increasingly dissatisfied with the &quot;band-aid&quot; moves of the front office and manager Mazzilli to help them through this period of struggle. Various minor league players such as Single-A Frederick OF [[Jeff Fiorentino]] were brought up in place of more experienced players such as OF [[David Newhan]], who had batted .311 the previous season.

After starting the season 42–28 (.600), the Orioles finished the season with a stretch of 32–60 (.348), ending at 74–88 (.457). Only the [[2005 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] (.346) had a worse winning percentage for the season than did the Orioles for the final 92 games. The club's major off-season acquisition, [[Sammy Sosa]], posted his worst performance in a decade, with 14 home runs and a .221 batting average. The Orioles did not attempt to re-sign him. The Orioles also allowed Palmeiro to file for free agency and publicly stated they would not re-sign him. On August 25, pitcher [[Sidney Ponson]] was arrested for [[DUI]], and on September 1, the Orioles moved to void his contract (on a morals clause) and released him. The [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] filed a grievance on Ponson's behalf and the case was sent to arbitration and was eventually resolved.

====2006 season====
{{main|2006 Baltimore Orioles season}}
In the [[2006 World Baseball Classic]], the Orioles contributed more players than any other major league team, with eleven players suiting up for their home nations. [[Erik Bedard]] and [[Adam Loewen]] pitched for [[Canada national baseball team|Canada]]; [[Rodrigo López (pitcher)|Rodrigo López]] and [[Geronimo Gil]] (released before the season began by the club) played for [[Mexico national baseball team|Mexico]]; [[Daniel Cabrera]] and [[Miguel Tejada]] for the [[Dominican Republic national baseball team|Dominican Republic]]; [[Javy López]] and [[Luis Matos]] for [[Puerto Rico national baseball team|Puerto Rico]]; [[Bruce Chen]] for [[Panama national baseball team|Panama]]; [[Ramon Hernandez]] for [[Venezuela national baseball team|Venezuela]]; and [[John Stephens (baseball player)|John Stephens]] for [[Australia national baseball team|Australia]]. The Orioles finished the 2006 season with a record of 70 wins and 92 losses, 27 games behind the AL East-leading Yankees.

====2007 season====
{{main|2007 Baltimore Orioles season}}
On June 18, 2007, the Orioles fired [[Sam Perlozzo]] after losing eight straight games. He was replaced on interim basis by [[Dave Trembley]]. On June 22, Miguel Tejada's consecutive-games streak came to an end due to an injury, the fifth-longest streak in major league history. [[Aubrey Huff]] became the first Oriole to hit for the cycle at home, on June 29 against the Angels. On July 7, [[Erik Bedard]] struck out 15 batters in a game against the [[2007 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] to tie a franchise record held by [[Mike Mussina]]. On July 31, 2007, Andy MacPhail named Dave Trembley as the Orioles manager through the remainder of the 2007 season, and advised him to &quot;Keep up the good work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-orioles-perlozzo&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns Yahoo!

The Orioles led the game 3–0 after three innings of play. Sixteen of Texas' thirty runs were scored in the final two innings. The Orioles would also fall in the nightcap, 9–7.

====2008 season====
{{main|2008 Baltimore Orioles season}}
[[File:Baltimore Orioles Script.svg|right|thumb|The script logo.]]The Orioles began the [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2008 season]] in a rebuilding mode under President of Baseball Operations [[Andy MacPhail]]. The Orioles traded away star players [[Miguel Tejada]] to the [[Astros]] and ace [[Erik Bedard]] to the [[Seattle Mariners]] for prized prospect [[Adam Jones (baseball)|Adam Jones]], lefty reliever [[George Sherrill]], and minor league pitchers [[Kam Mickolio]], [[Chris Tillman]], and Tony Butler. The Orioles started off the first couple weeks of the season near the top of their division as players such as [[Nick Markakis]] and newcomer [[Luke Scott]] led the team offensively. Although the Orioles hovered around .500 for much of the season, they had fallen back by September and were over 20 games behind the first place [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]]. They finished the season losing 11 of their final 12 games and 28 of their final 34. The team finished last for the first time since their [[1988 Major League Baseball season|1988 season]]. After the season ended, the Orioles showcased altered uniforms, with a circular 'Maryland' patch added to the left-hand sleeve of all jerseys and the grey road jerseys displaying Baltimore across the chest for the first time since [[1972 Major League Baseball season|1972]].

====2009 season====
{{main|2009 Baltimore Orioles season}}
[[File:Nick Markakis.jpg|thumb|right|2009 Orioles Jones and Markakis]]
On June 30, 2009, the Orioles rallied to score 10 runs against [[2009 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] after facing a 10–1 deficit in the 7th inning, winning the game by 11–10, setting a Major League Baseball record for the largest comeback by a last-place team over a first-place team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090630&amp;content_id=5618964&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb O's stage historic comeback vs. Red Sox | MLB.com: News].

However, the team finished the [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009 season]] with 64 wins and 98 losses, making it the worst record in the 2009 American League season. Despite this, Manager [[Dave Trembley]] was re-hired for the [[2010 Major League Baseball season|2010 season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20091002&amp;content_id=7287970&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb Orioles pick up option on Trembley | MLB.com: News].

The Orioles then went 2–16 to begin the season, one of the worst openings in MLB history. For much of the first half of the season, they had by far the worst record in the league.

On June 4, the Orioles replaced [[Dave Trembley]] as manager with third base coach [[Juan Samuel]].

On February 4, the Orioles signed free agent [[Vladimir Guerrero]] to be the team's designated hitter. Guerrero hit 29 home runs and had a .300 batting average in the 2010 season with the Texas Rangers. He has a career average of .320 and 436 home runs.

==Uniform==
The Orioles home uniform is white with the word &quot;Orioles&quot; written across the chest. The Orioles road uniform is gray with the word &quot;Baltimore&quot; written across the chest. An alternate uniform is black with the word &quot;Orioles&quot; written across the chest. The Orioles wear their black alternate jerseys (usually on Fridays) with the alternate &quot;O's&quot; cap, whether at home or on the road.

==Radio and television==
{{see|List of Baltimore Orioles broadcasters}}

===Current===
====Radio====
Orioles games are broadcast on a 20-station radio network in Maryland and nearby states, anchored by [[Flagship (radio)|flagship station]] [[WBAL (AM)|WBAL]]. [[Fred Manfra]] and [[Joe Angel]] alternate radio announcing duties.

====Television====
As part of the settlement of a television broadcast rights dispute with [[CSN Washington|Comcast SportsNet]] over the Washington Nationals, the Orioles severed their Comcast ties at the end of the 2006 season. All Orioles games are now televised on the Orioles-controlled [[Mid-Atlantic Sports Network|Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN)]], with some games also airing locally on [[WJZ-TV|WJZ-TV (ch. 13)]]. Longtime sportscaster [[Gary Thorne]], who is also recognized for his work as a hockey announcer, is the current television announcer for the Orioles, along with [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] member and former Orioles pitcher [[Jim Palmer]], as well as former Orioles catcher [[Rick Dempsey]]. Some MASN telecasts in conflict with Washington Nationals' game telecasts air on an alternate MASN2 feed. All Oriole games are televised, as their non-MASN games are televised by [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]], [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]], or [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]].

===Former===
Six former Oriole franchise radio announcers have received the Hall of Fame's [[Ford C. Frick Award]] for excellence in broadcasting: [[Chuck Thompson]] (who was also the voice of the old [[National Football League|NFL]] [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]]); [[Jon Miller]] (now with the [[San Francisco Giants]]); [[Ernie Harwell]], [[Herb Carneal]]; [[Bob Murphy (announcer)|Bob Murphy]] and [[Harry Caray]] (as a St. Louis Browns announcer in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paperofrecord.com/paper_view.asp?PaperId=834&amp;RecordId=1&amp;PageId=7750536&amp;iZyNetId={2E6BBCCF-5CD0-46CC-A586-07221F6521B4}&amp;iOrder=2&amp;iOrderDir=0&amp;iCurrentBlock=1 Paper of Record]. Paper of Record. Retrieved on 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;
). Other former Baltimore announcers include [[Josh Lewin]] (currently with [[Fox Sports]]), the late [[Bill O'Donnell (sportscaster)|Bill O'Donnell]], and Baltimore radio veteran [[Tom Marr]], who called the games during the &quot;Oriole Magic&quot; years on the old WFBR-AM (now [[WJZ (AM)|WJZ]]). In 1991, the Orioles experimented with longtime TV writer/producer [[Ken Levine (TV personality)|Ken Levine]] as a play-by-play broadcaster. Levine was best noted for his work on TV shows such as ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', but only lasted one season in the Orioles broadcast booth.

Other previous flagship radio stations include [[WBAL (AM)|WBAL]] (1090&amp;nbsp;kHz AM) from 1987–2006, the now-defunct [[WFBR (AM)|WFBR]] (1300&amp;nbsp;kHz AM) from 1979 through 1986, and a brief period with [[WCBM]] (680&amp;nbsp;kHz AM) for the 1987 season. Previous to 1979, WBAL had been the flagship station.

Former Oriole television broadcasters include: Thompson, Miller, former [[Baltimore Ravens]] broadcaster Scott Garceau, longtime versatile sportscaster [[Mel Proctor]], former [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] broadcaster [[Michael Reghi]], former major leaguer [[Buck Martinez]] (now with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] as their play-by-play announcer), as well as former Oriole players including Hall of Fame third baseman [[Brooks Robinson]], former pitcher [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]], and former outfielder [[John Lowenstein]].

Previous Baltimore television flagship stations have included: [[WMAR-TV]] (Channel 2) and [[WNUV|WNUV-TV]] (Channel 54), as well as regional cable network Home Team Sports (HTS) which eventually evolved into Comcast SportsNet.

==Musical traditions==	
===&quot;O!&quot;===	
Since its introduction at games by the &quot;Roar from 34&quot;, led by [[Wild Bill Hagy]] and others, in the late 1970s, it has been a tradition at Orioles games for fans to yell out the &quot;Oh&quot; in the line &quot;Oh, say does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave&quot; in &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;. &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; has special meaning to Baltimore historically, as it was written during the [[Battle of Baltimore]] in the [[War of 1812]] by [[Francis Scott Key]], a Baltimorean. &quot;O&quot; is not only short for &quot;Oriole&quot;, but the vowel is also a stand-out aspect of the [[Baltimorese|Baltimorean accent]].
	
The tradition is often carried out at other sporting events, both professional or amateur, and even sometimes at non-sporting events where the anthem is played, throughout the [[Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area|Baltimore/Washington area]] and beyond, notably at [[Baltimore Ravens]], [[Georgetown Hoyas]], [[Maryland Terrapins]],  [[Virginia Tech Hokies]], [[West Virginia Mountaineers]], [[Penn State Nittany Lions]] and Aberdeen Ironbirds games. Fans in Norfolk, Virginia, chanted &quot;O!&quot; even before the [[Norfolk Tides|Tides]] became an Orioles affiliate. &quot;O!&quot; has also been shouted during the anthem at [[Washington Redskins]] and [[Washington Capitals]] home games. The &quot;O&quot; Shout has traveled from across the DC Metro Area, from Frostburg, Maryland, to Salisbury, Maryland. The practice caught some attention in the spring of 2005, when some fans performed the &quot;O!&quot; cry at [[Washington Nationals]] games at [[RFK Stadium]]. At [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]]'s induction into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]], the crowd, comprising  mostly Orioles fans, carried out the &quot;O!&quot; tradition during [[Tony Gwynn]]'s daughter's rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. Additionally, a faint but audible &quot;O!&quot; could be heard on the television broadcast of Barack Obama's pre-inaugural visit to Baltimore as the National Anthem played before his entrance.

===&quot;Thank God I'm a Country Boy&quot;===
	
It has been an Orioles tradition since 1975 to play [[John Denver]]'s &quot;[[Thank God I'm a Country Boy]]&quot; during the [[seventh inning stretch]].

In the July 5, 2007 edition of Baltimore's weekly sports publication ''Press Box'', an article by Mike Gibbons covered the details of how this tradition came to be.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressboxonline.com/story.cfm?id=2189 PressBox: Baltimoreâ€™s Seventh-Inning Tradition Within a Tradition]. Pressboxonline.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other music===
Some songs from special events include &quot;[[One Moment in Time]]&quot; for Cal Ripken's record-breaking game. For his last game, the theme from ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'', &quot;There You'll Be&quot; by [[Faith Hill]], was featured. The theme from ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' was played at the last game at Memorial Stadium in 1991, and the song &quot;Magic to Do&quot; from the stage musical ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'' was used that season to commemorate &quot;Orioles Magic&quot; on 33rd Street. During the Orioles' heyday in the 1970s, a club song, appropriately titled &quot;Orioles Magic&quot;, was composed, and played when the team ran out until Opening Day of 2008. Starting the following game, the song (a favorite among many fans, who appreciated its references to [[Wild Bill Hagy]] and [[Earl Weaver]]) was only played (along with a video featuring several Orioles stars performing the song) after wins.

==Rex Barney==
For 23 years, [[Rex Barney]] was the [[Public address|PA announcer]] for the Orioles. His voice became a fixture of both Memorial Stadium and Camden Yards, and his expression &quot;Give that fan a contract&quot;, uttered whenever a fan caught a [[foul ball]], was one of his trademarks&amp;nbsp;– the other being his distinct &quot;Thank Yooooou...&quot; following every announcement (He was also known on occasion to say &quot;Give that fan an error&quot; after a dropped foul ball). Barney died on August 12, 1997, and in his honor that night's game at Camden Yards against the Oakland Athletics was held without a public–address announcer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/chronology/1997AUGUST.stm August 1997], Baseball library&lt;/ref&gt;

Barney was replaced as Camden Yards' PA announcer by [[Dave McGowan]], who remains in that capacity today.

==Post-season appearances==
Of the eight original American League teams, the Orioles were the last of the eight to win the [[World Series]], doing so in [[1966 World Series|1966]] with its four–game sweep of the heavily favored [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]]. When the Orioles were the St. Louis Browns, they played in only one World Series, the [[1944 World Series|1944 matchup]] against their Sportsman's Park tenants, the [[1944 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]].

The smaller group, inhabiting the delta of the Danube and its northern environs, was known as the Peucini.]] 
The '''Bastarnae''' or '''Basternae''' ({{lang-grc|Βαστάρναι or Βαστέρναι}}) were an ancient tribal group of probably  [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/55585/Bastarnae&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.no/books?id=-yd1huHoXJwC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=sciri+germanic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oZSgKDhMwa&amp;sig=5Eg6RtwI13Re55axDWcoyOcl7u8&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=BGTBTfa3Ac7ssgaV9uHjCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sciri%20germanic&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Celts|Celtic]] origin which, between not later than 200 BC and until at least AD 300, inhabited the region between the eastern [[Carpathian]] mountains and the [[Dnieper]] river (corresponding to the modern [[Republic of Moldova]] and western part of southern [[Ukraine]]). A branch of the Bastarnae, called the Peucini by Greco-Roman writers, occupied the region north of the [[Danube]] river delta.

Although possibly Celtic-speaking in 179 BC, the Bastarnae probably were Germanic in language and culture during the 1st century AD, but appear to have become assimilated by their neighbouring [[Sarmatians]] by the 3rd century. Like the latter, they were probably semi-nomadic. It has not yet been possible to identify specific Bastarnae archaeological sites.

The Peucini branch of the Bastarnae first came into conflict with the Romans in the 1st century BC, when they resisted, ultimately unsuccessfully, Roman expansion into [[Moesia]], the region on the southern bank of the Danube. Although probably on friendly terms with the Romans in the early 1st century, there is little evidence of the Peucini until ca. 180, when they are recorded as participating in an invasion of Roman territory in alliance with Sarmatian and Dacian elements. In the mid 3rd century, the Bastarnae were part of a Gothic-led grand coalition of lower Danube tribes which inflicted immense damage on the Balkan provinces of the Roman empire in a series of massive invasions. Large numbers of Bastarnae were resettled within the empire in the late 3rd century.

== Name etymology ==
The origin of the tribal name is uncertain. One possible derivation is from the [[proto-Germanic]] word ''*bastjan'' (from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root word *''b&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;as'') means &quot;binding&quot; or &quot;tie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Köbler *''b&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;as''&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, ''Bastarnae'' may have had the original meaning of an alliance or ''bund'' of tribes. It is possible that the Roman term ''[[basterna]]'', denoting a type of wagon or litter, is derived from the name of this tribe, which was known, like many Germanic tribes, to travel with a wagon-train for their families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dio LI.24.4&quot;&gt;Dio LI.24.4&lt;/ref&gt; Trubačev&lt;ref&gt;INDOARICA в Северном Причерноморье, pp. 212-3&lt;/ref&gt; proposes a derivation from [[Old Persian]], [[Avestan]] ''bast-'' &quot;bound, tied; slave&quot; (cf. [[Ossetic]] bættən &quot;bind&quot;, bast &quot;bound&quot;) and [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] ''*arna-'' &quot;offspring&quot;, equating it with the ''δουλόσποροι'' &quot;slave Sporoi&quot; mentioned by [[Nonnus]] and [[Cosmas]], where [[Early Slavs|Sporoi]] is the people [[Procopius]] mentions as the ancestors of the [[Slavs]].&lt;ref&gt;Procopius. Wars (VIII.I4, 22-30)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethno-linguistic affiliation ==
The Roman historian [[Livy]], writing in ca. AD 10, may imply that the Bastarnae were of Celtic origin. Relating events of ca. 180 BC, he describes them then as &quot;similar in language and customs&quot; to the [[Scordisci]], a tribe of [[Illyria]] described as Celtic by [[Strabo]] (although he adds that they had mingled with Illyrians and Thracians).&lt;ref&gt;Strabo VII.5.2&lt;/ref&gt; Livy also names their king, Cotto.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy XL.58&quot;&gt;Livy XL.58&lt;/ref&gt; This name is possibly of Celtic derivation (cf. [[Cottius]], king of the Alpine [[Salassi]] tribe and friend of [[Augustus]], after whom were named the [[Alpes Cottiae]] Roman province and the [[Cotini]] Celtic tribe of the northern Carpathians. Both probably derived from ''cotto-'' = &quot;old&quot; or &quot;crooked&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Faliyeyev (2007) entries 3806, 3890&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the Bastarnae were originally a mixed Celto-Germanic group.&lt;ref&gt;Todd (2004) 22-3&lt;/ref&gt; If so, they may have originally comprised residual Celtic elements in central eastern Europe such as the Cotini, who formed a Celtic enclave in the Germanic-speaking zone and are described by Tacitus as iron-ore miners working as tributaries of the powerful [[Quadi]] Germanic people.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus G.43&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans often used &quot;German&quot; as a geographical rather than ethnic classification.&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;Atlas of Ancient History&quot;, p.50 by [[Colin McEvedy]] for a historiographic discussion of this point&lt;/ref&gt; 

In any case, other Greco-Roman writers of the 1st century AD are unanimous that the Bastarnae were, in their own time, Germanic in language and culture. The Greek geographer [[Strabo]], writing ca. AD 5-20, says the Bastarnae are &quot;of Germanic stock&quot;, although he includes the non-Germanic Roxolani, a [[Sarmatian]] tribe, among the sub-tribes of the Bastarnae (probably in error).&lt;ref name=&quot;Strabo VII.3.17&quot;&gt;Strabo VII.3.17&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman geographer [[Pliny the Elder]] (ca. AD 77), refers to &quot;Bastarnae and other Germans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny NH IV.81&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (ca. AD 100), states: &quot;The Peucini, however, who are sometimes called Bastarnae, are like Germans in their language, way of life and types of dwelling and live in similar squalor and indolence...[However] mixed marriages are giving them to some extent the vile appearance of the Sarmatians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus G.46&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 3rd century, however, the Greek historian [[Dio Cassius]] states that the &quot;Bastarnae are properly classed as Scythians&quot; and &quot;members of the Scythian race&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dio LI.23.3, 24.2&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the 6th century historian [[Zosimus]], reporting events around AD 280, refers to &quot;the Bastarnae, a Scythian people&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zosimus I.34&quot;&gt;Zosimus I.34&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the miscegenation mentioned by Tacitus had, by the 3rd century, resulted in the Bastarnae becoming assimilated by the Sarmatians, perhaps adopting their tongue (which belonged to the [[Iranian people|Iranic]] group of Indo-European languages) and/or Sarmatian customs. On the other hand, the Bastarnae maintained a separate name-identity into the late 3rd century AD, possibly implying retention of their Germanic cultural heritage, distinctive in the lower Danube, until the arrival of the Goths.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Historia Augusta ''Probus'' 18&lt;/ref&gt;

== Territory ==
[[Image:Denube Delta Bank.JPG|thumb|right|A view of the Danube delta, showing the kind of swampy terrain originally inhabited by the Peucini branch of the Bastarnae.]]
It is generally assumed by scholars that the Bastarnae's original home was around the [[Vistula]] river (central Poland) and that they migrated south-eastwards to the Black Sea region around 200 BC (as, 400 years later, did the [[Goth]]ic ''ethnos'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Todd 2004 23&quot;&gt;Todd (2004) 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Strabo describes the Bastarnae territory vaguely as &quot;between the ''Ister'' (river Danube) and the ''Borysthenes'' (river Dnieper)&quot;. He identifies three sub-tribes of the Bastarnae: the Atmoni, Sidoni and Peucini. The latter derived their name from [[Peuce]], a large island in the Danube delta which they had colonised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strabo VII.3.17&quot;/&gt; {{hcref|a|Peuce island}} The 2nd century geographer Ptolemy states that the Carpiani or [[Carpi (Dacian tribe)|Carpi]] (believed to have occupied [[Moldavia]]) separated the Peucini from the other Bastarnae &quot;above Dacia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy III.5.9&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus among modern scholars is that the Bastarnae were, in the 2nd century, divided into two main groups. The larger group inhabited the north-eastern slopes of the Carpathians and the area between the [[Prut]] and [[Dnieper]] rivers (Moldova Republic/Western Ukraine), while a separate smaller group (the Peucini) dwelt in and North of the Danube delta region. Only the Peucini, therefore, were situated on the extreme northern border of the Roman province of [[Moesia Inferior]], which ran along the southernmost branch of the Danube delta.&lt;ref&gt;Barrington Plate 22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Material culture ==
[[Image:Origins 200 AD.png|thumb|right|Map showing the extent of the [[Chernyakhov]] culture (in orange) in the 3rd century, and the peoples involved, including the Bastarnae.]]
It is uncertain whether the Bastarnae were [[sedentary]] or [[nomadic]] (or semi-nomadic). Tacitus' statement that they were &quot;German in their way of life and types of dwelling&quot; implies a sedentary bias, but their close relations with the Sarmatians, who were nomadic, may indicate a more nomadic lifestyle, as does the wide geographical range of their attested inhabitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Todd 2004 23&quot;/&gt;

It has not to date been possible to identify individual archaeological sites as belonging to the Bastarnae, because no convincing typology of Bastarnae artefacts exists. It has been suggested that the Bastarnae are an especially good match, in location and in time, for the [[Zarubintsy culture]], despite the fact that it was centred somewhat to the North of the main area of Bastarnae residence. This culture, which flourished in the upper Dnieper and [[Pripyat River|Pripyat]] rivers between ca. 300 BC and AD 200, was sedentary, based on agriculture and the rearing of livestock. Its cultural artefacts show strong influences from the western [[steppe]] (i.e. Sarmatian influence) and, in  a later phase, from the Roman Danubian provinces. But the Zarubintsy culture has also been &quot;claimed&quot; for the [[Venedi]] tribe, who are regarded by many scholars as proto-Slavic - although even this is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Todd (2004) 24&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, it is not possible, on the current state of knowledge, to ascribe the Zarubintsy culture to any individual ethno-linguistic group. It is likely that Zarubintsy represents a wide range of peoples in the Poland- W. Ukraine region (possibly including the Bastarnae).&lt;ref&gt;Todd (2004) 23-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in about AD 200, the [[Chernyakhov]] culture became established  in the W. Ukraine/Moldova region inhabited by the Bastarnae. The culture is characterised by a high degree of sophistication in the production of metal and ceramic artefacts, as well as of uniformity over a vast area. Although this culture has conventionally been identified with the migration of the [[Goth]]ic ''ethnos'' into the region from the Northwest, Todd argues that its most important origin is Scytho-Sarmatian. Although the Goths certainly contributed to it, so probably did other peoples of the region such as the Dacians, [[Early Slavs|proto-Slavs]], [[Carpi]], and possibly the Bastarnae.&lt;ref&gt;Todd (2004) 26&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflict with Rome ==
=== Roman republican era (to 30 BC)===
==== Allies of Philip of Macedon (179-8 BC) ====
[[File:Roman_provinces_of_Illyricum,_Macedonia,_Dacia,_Moesia,_Pannonia_and_Thracia.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing the lower Danube provinces of the Roman empire, with the location of Illyrian and Thracian tribes]]

The Bastarnae first appear in the historical record in 179 BC, when they crossed the Danube in massive force (probably ca. 60,000 men, both cavalry and infantry, plus a wagon-train of accompanying women and children). They did so at the invitation of their long-time ally, king [[Philip V of Macedon]], a direct descendant of [[Antigonus]], one of the [[Diadochi]], the generals of [[Alexander the Great]] who had shared out his empire after his death in 323 BC. The Macedonian king had suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Romans in the [[Second Macedonian War]] (200-197 BC), which had reduced him from a powerful [[Hellenistic]] monarch to the status of a petty client-king with a much-reduced territory and a tiny army.{{hcref|b|Peace terms after 2nd Macedonian War}} After nearly 20 years of slavish adherence to the Roman Senate's dictats, Philip had been goaded beyond endurance by the incessant and devastating raiding of the [[Dardani]], a warlike Thraco-Illyrian&lt;ref&gt;A Mocsy. Pannonia and Upper Moesia&lt;/ref&gt; tribe on his northern border, which his treaty-limited army was too small to counter effectively. Counting on the Bastarnae, with whom he had forged friendly relations in earlier times, he plotted a strategy to deal with the Dardani and then to regain his lost territories in Greece and his political independence. First, he would unleash the Bastarnae against the Dardani. After the latter had been crushed, Philip planned to settle Bastarnae families in Dardania (southern [[Kosovo]]/[[Skopje]] region), to ensure that the region was permanently subdued. In a second phase, Philip aimed to launch the Bastarnae on an invasion of Italy via the Adriatic coast. Although he was aware that the Bastarnae were hardly likely to achieve the same success as [[Hannibal]] some 40 years earlier, and would most likely end up cut to pieces by the Romans, Philip hoped that the Romans would be distracted long enough to allow him to reoccupy his former possessions in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Livy XL.57&lt;/ref&gt;

But Philip, now 60 years of age, died before the Bastarnae could arrive. The Bastarnae host was still ''en route'' through Thrace, where it became embroiled in hostilities with the locals, who were unable (or unwilling) to provide them with sufficient food at affordable prices as they marched through. Probably in the vicinity of [[Philippopolis]] (modern Plovdiv, Bulgaria), the Bastarnae broke out of their marching columns and pillaged the land far and wide. The terrified local Thracians took refuge with their families and animal herds on the slopes of ''Mons Donuca'', the highest mountain in Thrace ([[Musala|Mt. Musala]], Rila Mts., Bulgaria). A large force of Bastarnae chased them up the mountain, but were driven back and scattered by a massive hailstorm. Then the Thracians ambushed them, turning their descent into a panic-stricken rout. Back at their [[laager|wagon-laager]] in the plain, around half the demoralised Bastarnae decided to return home, leaving ca. 30,000 to press on to Macedonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy XL.58&quot;/&gt;

Philip's son and successor [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]], while protesting his loyalty to Rome, deployed his Bastarnae guests in winter quarters in a valley in Dardania, presumably as a prelude to a campaign against the Dardani the following summer. But in the depths of winter their camp was attacked by the Dardani. The Bastarnae easily beat off the attackers, chased them back to their chief town, and besieged them. But they were surprised in the rear by a second force of Dardani which had approached their camp stealthily by mountain paths and proceeded to storm and ransack it. Having lost their entire baggage and supplies, the Bastarnae were obliged to withdraw from Dardania and to return home. Most perished as they crossed the frozen Danube on foot, only for the ice to give way.&lt;ref&gt;Livy XLI.19&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the failure of Philip's Bastarnae strategy, the suspicion aroused by these events in the Roman Senate, which had been warned by the Dardani of the Bastarnae invasion, ensured the demise of Macedonia as an independent state.&lt;ref&gt;Livy XLI.23 and XLII.12-4&lt;/ref&gt; Rome declared war on Perseus in 171 BC and after the Macedonian army was crushed at the [[Battle of Pydna]] (168 BC), Macedonia was split up into 4 Roman puppet-cantons (167 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Livy XLV.19&lt;/ref&gt; 21 years later, these were in turn abolished and annexed to the [[Roman Republic]] as the [[Macedonia (Roman province)|province of Macedonia]] (146 BC).

==== Allies of Getan high king Burebista (62 BC) ====
[[File:Scythia Minor map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Scythia Minor]] (Dobruja), showing the Greek coastal cities of Histria, Tomis, Callatis and Dionysopolis (Istria, Constanţa, Mangalia and Balchik).]]
[[File:HistriaCoins.jpg|thumb|right|Coin issued by the Greek coastal city of [[Histria (Sinoe)|Histria]] (Sinoe)]]
The Bastarnae first came into direct conflict with Rome as a result of expansion into the lower Danube region by the [[proconsuls]] (governors) of Macedonia in the period 75-72 BC. [[Gaius Scribonius Curio]] (proconsul 75-3 BC) campaigned successfully against the Dardani and the [[Moesi]], becoming the first Roman general to reach the river Danube with his army.&lt;ref&gt;Smith's Dictionary: ''Curio''&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, [[Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus|Marcus Licinius Lucullus]] (brother of the famous [[Lucullus|Lucius Lucullus]]), campaigned against the Thracian [[Bessi]] tribe and the Moesi, ravaging the whole of [[Moesia]], the region between the Haemus ([[Balkan]]) mountain range and the Danube. In 72 BC, his troops occupied the Greek coastal cities of [[Scythia Minor]] (modern [[Dobruja]] region, Romania/Bulgaria),{{hcref|c|Greek cities}} which had sided with Rome's [[Hellenistic]] arch-enemy, king [[Mithridates VI]] of [[Pontus]], in the [[Third Mithridatic War]] (73-63 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Smith's Dictionary: ''Lucullus''&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of Roman forces in the Danube delta was seen as a major threat by all the neighbouring transdanubian peoples: the Peucini Bastarnae, the Sarmatians and, most importantly, by [[Burebista]] (ruled 82-44 BC), king of the [[Getae]]. The Getae occupied the region today called [[Wallachia]] as well as Scythia Minor and were either a [[Dacian language|Dacian]]- or [[Thracian language|Thracian]]- speaking people.{{hcref|d|Language of Getae}} Burebista had unified the Getan tribes into a single kingdom, for which the Greek cities were vital trade outlets. In addition, he had established his hegemony over neighbouring Sarmatian and Bastarnae tribes. At its peak, the Getan kingdom reportedly was able to muster 200,000 warriors. Burebista led his transdanubian coalition in a struggle against Roman encroachment, conducting many raids against Roman allies in [[Moesia]] and Thrace, penetrating as far as Macedonia and [[Illyria]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabo VII.3.11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The coalition's main chance came in 62 BC, when the Greek cities rebelled against Roman rule. In 61 BC, the notoriously oppressive and militarily incompetent proconsul of Macedonia, [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida|Gaius Antonius]], nicknamed ''Hybrida'' (&quot;The Monster&quot;, an uncle of the famous [[Mark Antony]]) led an army against the Greek cities. As his army approached [[Histria (Sinoe)]], Antonius detached his entire mounted force from the marching column and led it away on a lengthy excursion, leaving his infantry without cavalry cover, a tactic he had already used with disastrous results against the Dardani.&lt;ref&gt;Dio XXXVIII.10.2&lt;/ref&gt; Dio implies that he did so out of cowardice, in order to avoid the imminent clash with the opposition. But it is more likely that he was pursuing a large enemy cavalry force, probably [[Sarmatians]], which was possibly acting as a decoy. A Bastarnae host, which had crossed the Danube to assist the [[Histrians]], promptly attacked, surrounded and massacred the Roman infantry, capturing several of their ''[[vexillum|vexilla]]'' (military standards).&lt;ref&gt;Dio XXXVIII.10.3 and LI.26.5&lt;/ref&gt; This battle resulted in the collapse of the Roman position on the lower Danube. Burebista annexed the Greek cities (55-48 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Crişan (1978) 118&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the subjugated &quot;allied&quot; tribes of Moesia and Thrace evidently repudiated their treaties with Rome, as they had to be re-conquered by [[Augustus]] in 29-8 BC (see below).

For 44 BC, Roman [[dictator perpetuus|dictator-for-life]] [[Julius Caesar]] planned to lead a major campaign to crush Burebista and his allies once and for all, but he was assassinated before it could start.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo VII.3.5&lt;/ref&gt; However, the campaign was made redundant by Burebista's overthrow and death in the same year, after which his Getan empire fragmented into 4, later 5 independent petty kingdoms. These were militarily far weaker, as Strabo assessed their combined military potential at just 40,000 armed men, and were often involved in internecine warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo VII.3.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dio LI.26.1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Geto-Dacians]] did not again become a threat to Roman hegemony in the lower Danube until the rise of [[Decebal]] 130 years later (AD 86).

=== Augustan era (30 BC - AD 14) ===
[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Augustus]] in the garb of Roman ''[[imperator]]'' (military supreme commander). By the end of his sole rule (AD 14), Augustus had expanded the empire to the line of the [[Danube]] river, which was to remain its central/eastern European border for its entire history (except for the occupation of [[Dacia]] 105-275). [[Musei Vaticani]], Rome ]]

Once he had established himself as sole ruler of the Roman state in 30 BC, Caesar's grand-nephew and adopted son [[Augustus]] inaugurated a strategy of advancing the empire's southeastern European border to the line of the Danube from the [[Alps]], the [[Dinaric Alps]] and Macedonia. The primary objective was to increase strategic depth between the border and Italy and also to provide a major fluvial supply-route between the Roman armies in the region.&lt;ref&gt;''Res Gestae'' 30&lt;/ref&gt; On the lower Danube, which was given priority over the upper Danube, this required the annexation of Moesia and Thrace; the latter, however, was spared annexation as it was in the hands of a friendly king. {{hcref|e|Roman annexation of Thrace}} The Romans' target were thus the tribes which inhabited Moesia, namely (from West to East) the [[Triballi]], Moesi and those Getae who dwelt South of the Danube. The Bastarnae were also a target because they had recently subjugated the Triballi, whose territory lay on the southern bank of the Danube between the tributary rivers ''Utus'' ([[Vit]]) and ''Ciabrus'' ([[Tsibritsa]]), with their chief town at [[Oescus]] (Gigen, Bulgaria).&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Augustus wanted to avenge the defeat of [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida|C. Antonius]] at [[Histria (Sinoe)]] 32 years before and to recover the lost standards. These were held in a powerful fortress called [[Genucla]] (Isaccea, near modern Tulcea, Rom., in the Danube delta region), controlled by [[Zyraxes]], the local Getan petty king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dio LI.26.5&quot;&gt;Dio LI.26.5&lt;/ref&gt; The man selected for the task was [[Marcus Licinius Crassus (consul 30 BC)|Marcus Licinius Crassus]], grandson of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]] the [[triumvir]] and an experienced general at 33 years of age, who was appointed proconsul of Macedonia in 29 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dio LI.23.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bastarnae provided the ''casus belli'' by crossing the Haemus and attacking the [[Dentheletae]], a Thracian tribe who were Roman allies. Crassus marched to the Dentheletae's assistance, but the Bastarnae host hastily withdrew over the Haemus at his approach. Crassus followed them closely into Moesia but they would not be drawn into battle, withdrawing beyond the Tsibritsa.&lt;ref&gt;Dio LI.23.5&lt;/ref&gt; Crassus now turned his attention to the Moesi, his prime target. After a successful campaign which resulted in the submission of a substantial section of the Moesi, Crassus again sought out the Bastarnae. Discovering their location from some peace envoys they had sent to him, he lured them into battle near the Tsibritsa by a stratagem. Hiding his main body of troops in a wood, he stationed as bait a smaller vanguard in open ground before the wood. As expected, the Bastarnae attacked the vanguard in force, only to find themselves entangled in the full-scale pitched battle with the Romans that they had tried to avoid. The Bastarnae tried to retreat into the forest but were hampered by the wagon-train carrying their women and children, as these could not move through the trees. Trapped into fighting to save their families, the Bastarnae were routed. Crassus personally killed their king, Deldo, in combat, a feat which qualified him for Rome's highest military honour, ''[[spolia opima]]'',  but Augustus refused to award it on a technicality.{{hcref|f|spolia opima}} Thousands of fleeing Bastarnae perished, many asphyxiated in nearby woods by encircling fires set by the Romans, others drowned trying to swim across the Danube. Nevertheless, a substantial force did escape over the river and dug themselves into a powerful hillfort. Crassus laid siege to fort, but had to enlist the assistance of [[Rholes]], the Getan petty king who ruled on the opposite bank, to dislodge them, for which service Rholes was granted the title of ''socius et amicus populi Romani'' (&quot;ally and friend of the Roman people&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Dio LI.24&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year (28 BC), Crassus marched on Genucla. Petty king Zyraxes escaped with his treasure and fled over the Danube into Scythia to seek aid from the Bastarnae and Sarmatians.&lt;ref&gt;Dio LI.26.6&lt;/ref&gt; But before he was able to bring reinforcements, Genucla fell to a combined land and fluvial assault by the Romans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dio LI.26.5&quot;/&gt; The strategic result of Crassus' campaigns was the permanent annexation of Moesia by Rome.

=== Roman imperial era (14 - 180) ===
The ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' (&quot;Acts of the divine Augustus&quot;), a self-congratulatory inscription commissioned by Augustus to list his achievements, states that he received an embassy from the Bastarnae seeking a treaty of friendship.&lt;ref&gt;Res Gestae Aug. 31&lt;/ref&gt; These would most likely have been the Peucini, who bordered on the empire. Such a treaty was seemingly remarkably effective, as the Bastarnae disappear, save for a single passing mention in Tacitus, from the Roman chronicles until c. AD 175, some 160 years after Augustus' inscription was carved.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus A.II.65&lt;/ref&gt; But the literary evidence for the history of this period is so thin that it cannot be excluded that the Bastarnae clashed with Rome during it.{{hcref|g|Historical evidence for early empire}} The Bastarnae were perhaps involved in the [[Dacian Wars]] of [[Domitian]] (86-88) and [[Trajan]] (101-102 and 105-106), since these took place in the lower Danube region and it is known that both sides were supported by neighbouring indigenous tribes. In the late 2nd century, the ''Historia Augusta'' mentions that in the rule of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (161-80), an alliance of lower Danube tribes including the Bastarnae, the Sarmatian Roxolani and the  [[Costoboci]] took advantage of the emperor's difficulties on the upper Danube (the [[Marcomannic Wars]]) to invade Roman territory.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta ''Marcus Aurelius'' II.22&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3rd century ===
During the late 2nd century, the main ethnic change in the northern Black sea region was the immigration, from the Vistula valley in the North, of the [[Goths]] and accompanying Germanic tribes such as the [[Taifali]] and the [[Hasdingi]], a branch of the [[Vandal]] people. This migration was part of a series of major population movements in the European ''barbaricum'' (the Roman term for regions outside their empire). The Goths appear to have established a loose political hegemony over the existing tribes in the region, or at least to have played the leading role in a series of major invasions of the empire launched by a grand coalition of lower Danubian tribes from ca. 238 onwards. The participation of the Bastarnae in these is likely but largely unspecified, due to Zosimus' and other chroniclers' tendency to lump all these tribes under the general term &quot;Scythians&quot; - meaning all the inhabitants of Scythia, rather than the specific people called the Scythians.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram (1988) 45&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in 250-1, the Bastarnae were probably involved in the Gothic and Sarmatian invasions which culminated in the Roman defeat at the [[Battle of Abrittus]] and the slaying of the emperor [[Decius]] (251). This disaster was the start of the [[Third Century Crisis]], a period of military and economic collapse which came close to destroying the empire. At this critical moment, the Roman army was crippled by the outbreak of a second smallpox pandemic, the [[plague of Cyprian]] (251-70). The effects are described by Zosimus as even worse than the earlier [[Antonine Plague|Antonine plague]] (166-80), which probably killed 15-30% of the empire's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus I.16, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking advantage of Roman military disarray, a vast number of barbarian peoples overran much of the empire. The Sarmato-Gothic alliance of the lower Danube carried out major invasions of the Balkans region in 252, and in the periods 253-8 and 260-8.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus I.16, 20, 21&lt;/ref&gt; The Peucini Bastarnae are specifically mentioned in the 267/8 invasion, when the coalition built a fleet in the estuary of the river ''Tyras'' ([[Dnieper]]). The Peucini Bastarnae would have been critical to this venture since, as coastal and delta dwellers, they would have had seafaring experience that the nomadic Sarmatians and Goths lacked. The barbarians sailed along the [[Black Sea]] coast to Tomis in Moesia Inferior, which they tried to take by assault without success. They then attacked the provincial capital [[Marcianopolis]] (Devnya, Bulg.), also in vain. Sailing on through the [[Bosporus]], the expedition laid siege to [[Thessalonica]] in Macedonia. Driven off by Roman forces, the coalition host moved overland into Thracia, where finally it was crushed by emperor [[Claudius II]] (r. 268-70) at [[Battle of Naissus|Naissus]] (269).&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus I.22-3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ultimate fate ==
Claudius II was the first of a sequence of military emperors (the so-called &quot;[[Illyrian emperors]]&quot; from their main ethnic origin) who restored order in the empire in the late 3rd century. These emperors followed a policy of large-scale resettlement within the empire of defeated barbarian tribes, granting them land in return for an obligation of military service much heavier than the usual conscription quota. The policy had the triple benefit, from the Roman point of view, of weakening the hostile tribe, repopulating the plague-ravaged frontier provinces (bringing their abandoned fields back into cultivation) and providing a pool of first-rate recruits for the army. But it could also be popular with the barbarian prisoners, who were often delighted by the prospect of a land grant within the empire. In the 4th century, such communities were known as ''[[laeti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1964) 620&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] (r. 276-82) is recorded as resettling 100,000 Bastarnae in Moesia, in addition to other peoples (Goths, Gepids and Vandals). The Bastarnae are reported to have honoured their oath of allegiance to the emperor, while the other resettled peoples mutinied while Probus was distracted by usurpation attempts and ravaged the Danubian provinces far and wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zosimus I.34&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta ''Probus'' 18&lt;/ref&gt; A further massive transfer of Bastarnae was carried out by emperor [[Diocletian]] (ruled 284-305) after he and his colleague [[Galerius]] defeated a coalition of Bastarnae and [[Carpi (Dacian tribe)|Carpi]] in 299.&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius IX.25&lt;/ref&gt; Such numbers may have amounted to a substantial proportion, if not all, of the Peucini Bastarnae: [[Aurelius Victor|Victor]] claims that the Carpi resettled in Pannonia by Diocletian at the same time, together with those previously transferred by [[Aurelian]], amounted to the entire Carpi tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Victor 39.43&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining Bastarnae of the Ukraine disappear into obscurity in the late empire. Neither of the main ancient sources for this period, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] and [[Zosimus]], mention the Bastarnae in their accounts of the 4th century, possibly implying the loss of their separate identity, presumably subsumed into the neighbouring Sarmatians or Goths. If the Bastarnae remained an identifiable group, it is highly likely that they participated in the vast Gothic-led migration, driven by [[Hun]]nic pressure, that was admitted into Moesia by emperor [[Valens]] in 376 and eventually defeated and killed Valens at [[Battle of Adrianople|Adrianople]] in 378. Zosimus consistently refers to the migrants as &quot;Scythians&quot; (unlike Ammianus, who refers to them as &quot;Goths&quot;), specifically stating at one point that, in addition, &quot;Goths, Taifali and other tribes&quot; were involved.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus IV.104-7; 107&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after a gap of 150 years, there is a final mention of Bastarnae in the mid 5th century. In 451, the [[Hun]]nic leader [[Attila]] invaded Gaul with a large army which was ultimately routed at the [[Battle of Châlons]] by a Roman-led coalition under the general [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordanes 38-40&lt;/ref&gt; Attila's host, according to [[Jordanes]], included contingents from the &quot;innumerable tribes that had been brought under his sway.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jordanes 38&lt;/ref&gt; One such were the Bastarnae, according to the Gallic nobleman [[Sidonius Apollinaris]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidonius ''Carmina'' 7.341&lt;/ref&gt; But the accuracy of Sidonius' list of Hunnic allies is doubtful, as he also gives the names of two Scythian tribes (the [[Neuri]] and [[Geloni]]) that were last mentioned in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' some three centuries earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy III.5&lt;/ref&gt; According to E.A. Thompson, it is likely that Sidonius, whose purpose was to write a [[panegyric]] and not a history, simply added some spurious names to his list, including the Bastarnae. On the other hand, Thompson does accept that some peoples on the list are plausible e.g. [[Burgundians]], [[Sciri]] and [[Franks]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1996) 149&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
{{cnote|a|It is not possible to identify the exact location of this feature both because of the imprecision of ancient sources and the fact that the Danube delta configuration has changed greatly since ancient times, as well as expanding into the sea by ca. 20km. Peuce (from the classical Greek word for &quot;pine&quot;) was also the name of a town, most likely on the island. Strabo states the Danube had 7 mouths, the southernmost of which was known as the ''Hieron Stoma'' or &quot;Sacred Mouth&quot;.

{{cnote|f|Crassus' feat, as Roman commander,  of killing the enemy leader in combat arguably entitled him to the highest honour a Roman soldier could gain: the ''[[spolia opima]]'' (literally: &quot;bountiful spoils&quot;, but this term may be a corruption of ''spolia optima'', &quot;supreme spoils&quot;), the right to hang the armour stripped from the enemy leader in the temple of [[Feretrius|Jupiter Feretrius]] in Rome, in emulation of the Founder of Rome [[Romulus]], a privilege granted only twice previously. But Crassus was denied the honour by Augustus on the technicality that he was not commander-in-chief of Roman forces at the time, a position claimed by Augustus himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dio LI.24.4&quot; /&gt; Augustus also forbade Crassus to accept the honorary title of ''imperator'' (&quot;supreme commander&quot;) from his troops, traditional for victorious generals.

After his return to Rome, Crassus disappears from the record altogether, both epigraphic and literary. This is highly unusual in a relatively well-documented period for a person of such distinction who was still only about 33 years old. His tomb has not been found in the excavated Crassus family mausoleum in Rome. This official &quot;air-brushing from history&quot; may imply punitive [[internal exile]] to a remote location, similar to that inflicted on the contemporary poet, [[Ovid]], who in AD 8, for an unknown offence, was ordered by Augustus to spend the rest of his life in Tomis (Constanţa) on the Black Sea. [[Ronald Syme]] points out the similarity of Crassus' removal from the official record with that of [[Cornelius Gallus]], the contemporary disgraced governor of Egypt, who was recalled by Augustus for assuming inappropriate honours.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1986) 271-2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But the loss of Tacitus' narrative for the entire [[Flavian]] period (69-96) and of [[Ammianus Marcellinus]]'s continuation until 353, as well as of most of [[Dio Cassius]]'s History (up to 229), leaves a massive gap in our knowledge of the political history of the early empire, which is only patchily filled by inferior chronicles such as the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', inscriptions and other evidence}}

[[File:Flag of Bohemia.svg|thumb|right|[[Flag of Bohemia|Historical flag of Bohemia]]]]

'''Bohemia''' ({{lang-cs|Čechy}};&lt;ref&gt;There is no distinction in the [[Czech language]] between adjectives referring to Bohemia and to the Czech Republic; i.e. ''český'' means both ''Bohemian'' and ''Czech''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Audio-de|Böhmen|De-Böhmen.ogg}}; {{lang-pl|Czechy}}; {{lang-fr|Bohême}}; {{lang-la|Bohemia}}) is a [[Historical regions of Central Europe|historical region in central Europe]], occupying the western two-thirds of the traditional [[Czech Lands]]. It is located in the contemporary [[Czech Republic]] with its capital in [[Prague]]. In a broader meaning, it often refers to the entire Czech territory, including [[Moravia]] and [[Czech Silesia]],&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-05&lt;/ref&gt; especially in historical contexts, such as the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. 

Bohemia has an area of 52,065&amp;nbsp;km² and today is home to approximately 6 million of the Czech Republic's 10.3 million inhabitants. It is bordered by [[Germany]] to the southwest, west, and northwest, [[Poland]] to the northeast, the Czech historical region of [[Moravia]] to the east, and [[Austria]] to the south. Bohemia's borders are marked with mountain ranges such as the [[Bohemian Forest]], the [[Ore Mountains (Central Europe)|Ore Mountains]], and the [[Krkonoše]] (Giant Mountains), the highest within the [[Sudeten mountain]] range.

==Etymology==
In the 2nd century BC, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were competing for dominance in northern Italy, with various peoples including the [[Boii]]. The Romans defeated the Boii at the [[Battle of Placentia (194 BC)]] and the [[Battle of Mutina 193 BCE|Battle of Mutina (193 BC)]]. After this, many of the Boii retreated north across the Alps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collis, John 2003&quot;&gt;Collis, John. ''The Celts: Origins, Myth and Inventions''. Tempus Publishing, 2003. ISBN 0-7524-2913-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman authors refer to the area they invaded as '''Boihaemum''', the earliest mention&lt;ref name=&quot;Collis, John 2003&quot;/&gt; being in [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' 28&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ger.shtml#28&lt;/ref&gt; (written at the end of the 1st century AD). The name appears to include the tribal name ''Boi-'' plus the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] element *''xaim-'' &quot;home&quot; (whence Gothic ''haims'', German ''Heim'', English ''home''). This Boihaemum included parts of southern Bohemia as well as parts of [[Bavaria]] (whose name also seems to derive from the tribal name Boii) and Austria.

===Ancient Bohemia===
In the late 2nd century BC, many of the [[Boii]] tribe, after defeat at Roman hands, fled north across the Alps from northern Italy  into an area called '''Boihaemum''' by the Romans, which included the southern part of present-day Bohemia.

The western half was conquered and settled from the 1st century BC by Germanic (probably [[Suebi]]c) peoples including the [[Marcomanni]]; the elite of some Boii then migrated west to modern Switzerland and southeastern Gaul. Those Boii that remained in the eastern part were eventually absorbed by the Marcomanni. Part of the Marcomanni, renamed the Bavarians (Baiuvarum), later migrated to the southwest. Although the leading tribes changed, there was a large degree of continuity in the actual population, and at no time was there a wholesale depopulation or change in ethnic stock.

After the Bavarian emigration, Bohemia was partially repopulated around the 6th century, as part of the territory often crossed during the [[Migration Period]] by  [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] and major [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes,  precursors of today's [[Czech people|Czechs]], though the exact amount of Slavic immigration is a subject of debate.  The Slavic influx was divided into two or three waves. The first wave came from the southeast and east, when the Germanic [[Langobards]] left Bohemia (c. 568 AD). Later immigrants came from the Black Sea region, as shown by [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] [[Toponymy|place names]] as  &quot;Dudleb&quot; (today in [[Prachens]] region, South Bohemia)  and &quot;Charvat&quot; ([[White Croats|Choroathos]]).  Soon after, from the 630s to 660s, the territory was taken by [[Samo]]'s tribal confederation. His death marked the end of the old &quot;Slavonic&quot; confederation, the second attempt to establish such a Slavonic union after [[Carantania]] in [[Carinthia (province)|Carinthia]].

Other sources (''[[Descriptio civitatum et regionum ad septentrionalem plagam Danubii]]'', Bavaria, 800-850) divide the population of Bohemia at this time into the Merehani, Marharaii, Beheimare (Bohemani) and Fraganeo. (The suffix ''-ani'' or ''-ni'' means &quot;people of-&quot;).  The great tribes of ''Dudleb'', ''Lemuz'' and ''Charvat'' are missing from this list, which shows a linguistic and cultural shift from [[Sarmatian]] in favor of [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]] dialects, a common occurrence in nomadic immigrations. Christianity first appeared in the early 9th century, but became dominant much later, in the 10th or 11th century.

The 9th century was crucial for the future of Bohemia. The manorial system sharply declined, as it did in Bavaria. The influence of the central ''Fraganeo-Czechs'' grew, as a result of the important cultic centre in their territory. They were Slavic-speaking and thus contributed to the transformation of diverse neighbouring populations into a new nation named and led by them with a united ''slavic'' ethnic consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Petr Charvát: &quot;Zrod Českého státu&quot; [Origin of the Bohemian State], March 2007, ISBN 80-7021-845-2, in Czech&lt;/ref&gt;

===Přemysl dynasty===
[[File:Wappen Königreich Böhmen.png|thumb|left|The Coat of arms of the Bohemian King and Kingdom.]]

Initially, Bohemia was a part of [[Greater Moravia]]. The latter, which had been weakened by years of internal conflict and constant warfare, ultimately succumbed and fragmented due to the continual incursions of the invading nomadic [[Magyars]]. However, Bohemia's initial incorporation into the Moravian Empire resulted in the extensive Christianization of the population. A native monarchy arose to the throne, and Bohemia came under the rule of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]], which would rule the Czech lands for the next several hundred years.

The Přemyslids secured their frontiers from the remnant Asian interlocurs, after the collapse of the Moravian state, by entering into a state of semi-vassalage to the Frankish rulers. This alliance was facilitated by Bohemia's conversion to [[Christianity]], in the 9th century. Continuing close relations were developed with the East [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdom, which devolved from the [[Carolingians|Carolingian]] Empire, into East Francia, eventually becoming the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

After a decisive victory of the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia over invading Magyars in the 955 [[Battle of Lechfeld]], [[Boleslav I of Bohemia|Boleslaus I]] of Bohemia was granted the [[March of Moravia]] by German emperor [[Otto the Great]]. Bohemia would remain a largely autonomous state under the Holy Roman Empire for several decades. The jurisdiction of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was definitively reasserted when [[Jaromir, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromír of Bohemia]] was granted fief of the Kingdom of Bohemia by Emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|King Henry II]] of the Holy Roman Empire, with the promise that he hold it as a vassal once he re-occupied Prague with a German army in 1004,  ending the rule of [[Boleslaw I of Poland]].

The first to use the title of &quot;[[Monarch|King]] of Bohemia&quot; were the Přemyslid dukes [[Vratislav II of Bohemia|Vratislav II]] (1085) and [[Vladislav II of Bohemia|Vladislav II]] (1158), but their heirs would return to the title of [[duke]]. The title of king became hereditary under [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (1198). His grandson [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]] (king from 1253–1278) conquered a short-lived empire which contained modern [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]]. The mid-13th century saw the beginning of substantial German immigration as the court sought to replace losses from the brief [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] in 1241. Germans settled primarily along the northern, western, and southern borders of Bohemia, although many lived in towns throughout the kingdom.

===Luxembourg dynasty===
The [[House of Luxembourg]] accepted the invitation to the Bohemian throne with the crowning of [[John I of Bohemia]] in 1310. His son, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] became King of Bohemia in 1346. He founded [[Charles University in Prague]], central Europe's first university, two years later. His reign brought Bohemia to its peak both politically and in total area, resulting in his being the first King of Bohemia to also be elected as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Under his rule the [[Bohemian crown]] controlled such diverse lands as [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Upper Lusatia]] and [[Lower Lusatia]], [[Brandenburg]], an area around [[Nuremberg]] called New Bohemia, [[Luxembourg]], and several small towns scattered around Germany.

===Hussite Bohemia===
During the ecumenical [[Council of Constance]] in 1415, [[Jan Hus]], the [[Rector#Academic rectors|rector]] of Charles University and a prominent reformer and religious thinker, was sentenced to be burnt at the stake as a [[Heresy|heretic]]. The verdict was passed despite the fact that Hus was granted formal protection by Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] prior to the journey. Hus was invited to attend the council to defend himself and the Czech positions in the religious court, but with the emperor's approval, he was executed on July 6, 1415. The execution of Hus, as well as five consecutive papal [[crusades]] against followers of Hus, forced the Bohemians to defend themselves. Their defense and rebellion against Roman Catholics became known as the [[Hussite Wars]].

The uprising against imperial forces was led by a former mercenary, [[Jan Žižka]] of Trocnov. As the leader of the Hussite armies, he used innovative tactics and weapons, such as [[howitzer]]s, [[pistol]]s, and [[Wagenburg|fortified wagons]], which were revolutionary for the time, and established Žižka as a great general who never lost a battle.

After Žižka's death, [[Prokop the Great]] took over the command for the army, and under his lead the Hussites were victorious for another ten years, to the sheer terror of Europe. The Hussite cause gradually splintered into two main factions, the moderate [[Utraquism|Utraquists]] and the more fanatic [[Taborite]]s. The [[Utraquists]] began to lay the groundwork for an agreement with the Catholic Church and found the more radical views of the Taborites distasteful. Additionally, with general war weariness and yearning for order, the Utraquists were able to eventually defeat the Taborites in the [[Battle of Lipany]] in 1434. Sigismund said after the battle that &quot;only the Bohemians could defeat the Bohemians.&quot;

Despite an apparent victory for the Catholics, the Bohemian Utraquists were still strong enough to negotiate [[freedom of religion]] in 1436. This happened in the so-called Basel Compacts, declaring peace and freedom between Catholics and Utraquists. It would only last for a short period of time, as [[Pope Pius II]] declared the Basel Compacts to be invalid in 1462.

In 1458, [[George of Podebrady]] was elected to ascend to the Bohemian throne. He is remembered for his attempt to set up a pan-European &quot;Christian League&quot;, which would form all the states of Europe into a community based on religion. In the process of negotiating, he appointed [[Leo of Rozmital]] to tour the European courts and to conduct the talks. However, the negotiations were not completed, because George's position was substantially damaged over time by his deteriorating relationship with the Pope.

===Habsburg Monarchy===
[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|200px|Bohemia as the heart of ''[[Europa regina]]'', 1570]]
After the death of King [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]] in the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, Archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] of [[Austria]] became King of Bohemia and the country became a constituent state of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

Bohemia enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1620, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period. In 1609, Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]] who made Prague again the capital of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] at the time, himself a Roman Catholic, was moved by the Bohemian nobility to publish ''Maiestas Rudolphina'', which confirmed the older ''Confessio Bohemica'' of 1575.

After Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] began oppressing the rights of Protestants in Bohemia, the resulting [[Bohemian Revolt]] led to outbreak of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1618. Elector [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]], a Protestant, was elected by the Bohemian nobility to replace Ferdinand on the Bohemian throne, and was known as the [[Winter King]]. Frederick's wife, the popular [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth Stuart]] and subsequently Elizabeth of Bohemia, known as the Winter Queen or Queen of Hearts, was the daughter of King [[James I of England]]. However, after Frederick's defeat in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620, 27 Bohemian estates leaders together with [[Jan Jesenius]], rector of the [[Charles University]] of Prague were executed on the Prague's Old Town Square on 21 June 1621 and the rest were exiled from the country; their lands were then given to Catholic loyalists (mostly of Bavarian and Saxon origin), this ended the pro-reformation movement in Bohemia and also ended the role of Prague as ruling city of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

Until the so-called &quot;renewed constitution&quot;&lt;!--description needed--&gt; of 1627, the German language was established as a second official language in the Czech lands. The Czech language remained the first language in the kingdom. Both German and Latin were widely spoken among the ruling classes, although German became increasingly dominant, while Czech was spoken in much of the countryside.

The formal independence of Bohemia was further jeopardized when the Bohemian Diet approved administrative reform in 1749. It included the indivisibility of the [[Habsburg_Monarchy#Rulers_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.2C_1526.E2.80.931918|Habsburg Empire]] and the centralization of rule; this essentially meant the merging of the Royal Bohemian Chancellery with the Austrian Chancellery.

At the end of the 18th century, the [[Czech National Revival]] movement, in cooperation with part of the Bohemian aristocracy, started a campaign for restoration of the kingdom's historic rights, whereby the Czech language was to replace German as the language of administration. The [[enlightened absolutism]] of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] and [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], who introduced minor language concessions, showed promise for the Czech movement, but many of these reforms were later rescinded. During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolution of 1848]], many Czech nationalists called for autonomy for Bohemia from Habsburg Austria, but the revolutionaries were defeated. The old Bohemian Diet, one of the last remnants of the independence, was dissolved, although the Czech language experienced a rebirth as [[romantic nationalism]] developed among the Czechs.

In 1861, a new elected Bohemian Diet was established. The renewal of the old Bohemian Crown (Kingdom of Bohemia, Margraviate of Moravia, and Duchy of Silesia) became the official political program of both Czech liberal politicians and the majority of Bohemian aristocracy (&quot;state rights program&quot;), while parties representing the German minority and small part of the aristocracy proclaimed their loyalty to the centralistic Constitution (so-called &quot;Verfassungstreue&quot;). After the defeat of Austria in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, Hungarian politicians achieved the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], ostensibly creating equality between the Austrian and Hungarian halves of the empire. An attempt by the Czechs to create a tripartite monarchy (Austria-Hungary-Bohemia) failed in 1871. However, the &quot;state rights program&quot; remained the official platform of all Czech political parties (except for social democrats) until 1918.

===Twentieth century===
[[File:Czechoslovakia01.png|thumb|250px|right|Bohemia (westernmost area) within Czechoslovakia between 1928–38]]
After [[World War I]], Bohemia (as the biggest and most populated land) became the core of the newly-formed country of [[Czechoslovakia]], which combined Bohemia, [[Moravia]], [[Austrian Silesia]], Upper Hungary (present-day [[Slovakia]]) and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] into one state. Under its first president, [[Tomáš Masaryk]], Czechoslovakia became a liberal democratic republic but serious issues emerged regarding the Czech majority's relationship with the native German and Hungarian minorities.

[[File:Karlovy Vary Czech Rep.jpg|thumb|left|The Bohemian town of [[Karlovy Vary]]]]
Following the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, the border regions of Bohemia historically inhabited predominantly by ethnic Germans (the [[Sudetenland]]) were annexed to [[Nazi Germany]]; this was the only time in Bohemian history that its territory was politically divided. The remnants of Bohemia and Moravia were then annexed by Germany in 1939, while the Slovak lands became the separate [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak Republic]], a puppet state of [[Nazi Germany]]. From 1939 to 1945 Bohemia, (without the Sudetenland), together with Moravia formed the German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] (''Reichsprotektorat Böhmen und Mähren''). Any open opposition to German occupation was brutally suppressed by the Nazi authorities and many Czech patriots were executed as a result. After [[World War II]] ended in 1945, the vast majority of remaining Germans were [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War II|&quot;ethnically cleansed&quot;]] by force by the order of the re-established Czechoslovak central government, based on Potsdam Agreement, and their property was confiscated by the Czech authorities. This severely depopulated the area and from this moment on locales were only referred to in their Czech equivalents regardless of their previous demographic makeup. After World War II, Czechoslovakia was re-established. In 1946, the Communist Party {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} strongly subsidized by the Soviet Union (due to an agreement amongst the Allies, Patton's armies reluctantly did not enter Prague and the city had to liberate itself before being officially liberated by the Soviet Red Army) won elections. In February 1948 the Communists ousted the remaining democratic ministers from the government in a coup d'état and installed a pro-Soviet authoritarian state.

Beginning in 1949, Bohemia ceased to be an administrative unit of Czechoslovakia, as the country was divided into administrative regions. Between 1949 and 1989 Czechoslovakia (from 1960 officially called Czechoslovak Socialistic Republic) became a Soviet satellite even though there was not a Soviet army present (interestingly enough, surrounding countries including Eastern Austria were occupied by the Red Army) until Czechoslovak Communist Party started to reform and democratize itself in 1968. This &quot;[[Prague Spring]]&quot; process was stopped abruptly by an invasion of 'brotherly' armies of Warsaw Pact in August 1968. In 1989, [[Agnes of Bohemia]] became the first saint from a Central European country to be canonized by [[Pope John Paul II]] before the &quot;[[Velvet Revolution]]&quot; later that year. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993 (the &quot;[[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|Velvet Divorce]]&quot;), the territory of Bohemia became part of the new [[Czech Republic]].

The Czech constitution from 1992 refers to the &quot;citizens of the Czech Republic in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia&quot; and proclaims continuity with the statehood of the [[Bohemian Crown]]. Bohemia is not currently an administrative unit of the Czech Republic. Instead, it is divided into the Prague, [[Central Bohemian Region|Central Bohemian]], [[Pilsen Region|Plzeň]], [[Carlsbad Region|Karlovy Vary]], [[Ústí nad Labem Region|Ústí nad Labem]], [[Liberec Region|Liberec]], and [[Hradec Králové Region|Hradec Králové]] [[Regions of the Czech Republic|Regions]], as well as parts of the [[Pardubice Region|Pardubice]], [[Vysočina Region|Vysočina]], [[South Bohemian Region|South Bohemian]] and [[South Moravian Region]]s.

'''BBC Radio 1''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] national [[radio station]] operated by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] which also broadcasts internationally, specialising in current [[popular music]] and chart hits throughout the day. Radio 1 provides alternative genres after 7:00pm including electronic dance, hip hop, rock or interviews. It is aimed primarily at the 15–29 age group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/service_licences/radio/radio_servicelicences/radio1_servicelicence_30apr2007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Radio 1 Service Licence (Issued 30 April 2007)|publisher=[[BBC Trust]]|date=2007-04-30|accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the average age of the audience is 33.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CAgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fmedia%2F2008%2Foct%2F24%2Fcommercialradio-bbc&amp;rct=j&amp;q=average+age+radio+1+listener&amp;ei=7ImRS_PtCpey0gTWhYXyDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHN5js6E9y8zq2XMXNIKjKuX2RJZw&amp;sig2=7wySUX7jtqLmjyLC5Gj7Vw&lt;/ref&gt; Radio 1 was launched at 7:00am on 30 September 1967 as a direct response to the popularity of offshore [[UK pirate radio|pirate radio]] stations such as [[Radio Caroline]], which had been outlawed by Act of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/index.html www.radiorewind.co.uk - Radio 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===First broadcast===
The first [[DJ]] to broadcast on the new station was [[Tony Blackburn]], whose cheery style, first heard on [[Radio Caroline]] and [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]], won him the prime slot on what became known as the &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast Show&quot; (although its original formal title, as shown in the ''Radio Times'' was ''Daily Disc Delivery'', while Blackburn himself referred to it eponymously as the ''Tony Blackburn Show''). The first words on Radio 1 – after a &quot;countdown&quot; by the Controller of Radios 1 and [[BBC Radio 2|2]], Robin Scott, and a jingle, recorded at [[PAMS]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], beginning &quot;The voice of Radio 1&quot; – were &quot;... And, good morning everyone. Welcome to the exciting new sound of Radio 1&quot;. This was the first use of US-style jingles on BBC radio, but the style was familiar to listeners who were acquainted with Blackburn and other DJs from their days on pirate radio. The first complete record played on Radio 1 was &quot;[[Flowers in the Rain]]&quot; by [[The Move]] (although technically the first music played was &quot;Theme One&quot; by [[George Martin]] leading into part of &quot;Beefeaters (On Parade)&quot; by [[John Dankworth|Johnny Dankworth]], Blackburn's signature tune carried over from pirate radio). The second single was &quot;[[Massachusetts (Bee Gees song)|Massachusetts]]&quot; by [[Bee Gees|The Bee Gees]]. The breakfast show remains the most prized slot in the Radio 1 schedule, with every change of breakfast show presenter exciting considerable media interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/radio_1_launch_day.htm Radio 1 Launch Day from Radio Rewind]. Retrieved 13 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
The initial rota of staff included [[John Peel]] (who remained with the station until his death in October 2004) and a gaggle of others, some hired from pirates, such as [[Keith Skues]], [[Ed Stewart]], [[Mike Raven]], David Ryder, Jim Fisher, [[Jimmy Young (disc jockey)|Jimmy Young]], [[Dave Cash (disc jockey)|Dave Cash]], [[Kenny Everett]], [[Simon Dee]], Duncan Johnson, Doug Crawford, [[Tommy Vance]], [[Chris Denning]], [[Emperor Rosko]], [[Pete Murray (disc jockey)|Pete Murray]], and [[Bob Holness]]. Many of the most popular pirate radio voices, such as Simon Dee, had only a one-hour slot per week, (&quot;Midday Spin.&quot;) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/original_presenter_list.htm Radio 1 Original Presenter List from Radio Rewind.] Retrieved 13 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annie Nightingale]], who joined in 1970, was effectively Britain's first female DJ and is now the longest serving presenter, having constantly evolved her musical tastes with the times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/annie_nightingale_page.htm Annie Nightingale from Radio Rewind.] Retrieved 13 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s peak===
Initially, the station was unpopular with some of its target audience who, it is claimed, disliked the fact that much of its airtime was shared with [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] and that it was less unequivocally aimed at a young audience than the offshore stations, with some DJs such as [[Jimmy Young]] being in their 40s. The very fact that it was part of an &quot;establishment&quot; institution such as the [[BBC]] was a turn-off for some, and [[needle time]] restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had. It also had limited finances (partially because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station) and often, as in January 1975, suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks, strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives.

Despite this, it gained massive audiences, becoming the most listened to station in the world with audiences of over 10 million claimed for some of its shows (up to 20 million for Blackburn's Breakfast Show). In the early-mid 1970s Radio 1 presenters were rarely out of the British tabloids, thanks to the Publicity Department's high profile work. The popularity of Radio 1's touring summer live broadcasts the [[Radio 1 Roadshow]] - usually as part of the BBC 'Radio Weeks' promotions that took Radio 1, 2 and 4 shows on the road - drew some of the largest crowds of the decade. The station undoubtedly played a role in maintaining the high sales of 45 rpm single records although it benefited from a lack of competition, apart from [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] and the tiny [[Manx Radio]] in the Isle of Man. ([[Independent Local Radio]] did not begin until October 1973 and took many years to cover virtually all of the UK). [[Alan Freeman]]'s 'Saturday Rock Show' was voted 'Best Radio Show' 5 years running by readers of a national music publication, and was then axed by controller Derek Chinnery.

===1990s changes===
In his last few months as controller, Johnny Beerling commissioned a handful of new shows that in some ways set the tone for what was to come under [[Matthew Bannister]]. One of these &quot;[[Loud'n'proud]]&quot; was the UK's first national radio series aimed at a [[gay]] audience (made in [[Manchester]] and was aired from August 1993). Far from being a parting quirk, the show was a surprise hit and led to the network's first coverage of the large outdoor [[Gay Pride]] event in 1994. Bannister took the reins fully in October 1993. His aim was to rid the station of its '[[Smashie and Nicey]]' image and make it appeal to the under 25s. Although originally launched as a youth station, by the early 1990s, its loyal listeners (and DJs) had aged with the station over its 25 year history. Many long-standing DJs, such as [[Simon Bates]], [[Dave Lee Travis]], [[Alan Freeman]], [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]], [[Gary Davies]], and later [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]], [[Bruno Brookes]] and [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]] left the station or were sacked, and in January 1995 old music (typically anything recorded before 1990) was banned from the daytime [[playlist]].

Many listeners rebelled as the first new DJs to be introduced represented a crossover from other parts of the BBC (notably Bannister and Trevor Dann's former colleagues at the BBC's London station, [[BBC GLR|GLR]]) with [[Emma Freud]] and [[Danny Baker]]. Another problem was that, at the time, [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] was sticking resolutely to a format which appealed mainly to those who had been listening since the days of the [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]], and commercial radio, which was targeting the &quot;Radio 1 and a half&quot; audience, consequently enjoyed a massive increase in its audience share at the expense of Radio One.

After the departure of [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]], who had been unsuccessfully moved from his long-running afternoon show to the breakfast show in January 1994, Bannister hired [[Chris Evans (British broadcaster)|Chris Evans]] to present the prime morning slot in April 1995. Evans was a popular but controversial presenter who was eventually sacked in 1997 after he demanded to present the breakfast show for only four days per week. Evans was replaced from February 17, 1997 by [[Mark and Lard]] – [[Mark Radcliffe]] (along with his sidekick [[Marc Riley]]), who found the slick, mass-audience style required for a breakfast show did not come naturally to them. They were replaced by [[Zoe Ball]] and [[Kevin Greening]] eight months later in October 1997, with Greening moving on and leaving Ball as solo presenter. The re-invention of the station happened at a fortuitous time, with the rise of [[Britpop]] in the mid-90s – bands like [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] were popular and credible at the time and the station's popularity rose with them. Documentaries like John Peel's &quot;Lost In Music&quot; which looked at the influence that the use of [[drugs]] have had over popular musicians received critical acclaim but were slated inside [[Broadcasting House]].

Later in the 90s the Britpop boom declined, and manufactured chart pop ([[boy bands]] and acts aimed at sub-teenagers) came to dominate the charts. New-genre music occupied the evenings (indie on weekdays and dance at weekends), with a mix of specialist shows and playlist fillers through late nights. The rise of [[rave]] culture through the late 80s and early 90s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth-orientated movement by bringing in club DJ [[Pete Tong]] amongst others. There had been a dance music programme on Radio 1 since 1987 and Pete Tong was the second DJ to present an all dance music show. This quickly gave birth to the [[Essential Mix]] where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two hour slot. Dance music has been a permanent feature on Radio 1 since with club DJ's such as [[Judge Jules]], [[Danny Rampling]] and [[Seb Fontaine]] all having shows as well as Radio 1 hosting an annual weekend in [[Ibiza]]. 

Listening figures continued to decline but the station succeeded in targeting a younger age-group and more cross gender groups. Eventually, this change in content was reflected by a rise in audience that is continuing to this day. Notably, the station has received praise for shows such as [[The Surgery with Aled]], [[Bobby Friction]] and [[DJ Nihal|Nihal]], ''The Evening Session'' with [[Steve Lamacq]] and its successor [[Zane Lowe]]. Its [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/ website] has also been well received.

However, the breakfast show and the [[UK Top 40]] continued to struggle. In 2000, Zoe Ball was replaced in the mornings by friend and fellow [[ladette]] [[Sara Cox]], but, despite heavy promotion, listening figures for the breakfast show continued to fall. In 2004 Cox was replaced by [[Chris Moyles]]. The newly rebranded breakfast show is known as [[The Chris Moyles Show]] and has increased its audience, now ahead of [[Today programme|The Today Programme]] on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] as the second most popular breakfast show (after 'Wake up with Wogan' hosted by [[Terry Wogan]]). Moyles continued to use innovative ways to try to tempt listeners from the 'Wake up with Wogan' show; in 2006, for example, creating a 'SAY NO TO WOGAN' campaign live on-air. This angered the BBC hierarchy, though the row simmered down when it was clear that the 'campaign' had totally failed to alter the listening trends of the time – Wogan still increases figures at a faster rate than Moyles. The chart show's ratings fell after the departure of long-time host [[Mark Goodier]], amid falling single sales in the UK. Ratings for the show fell in 2002 whilst Goodier was still presenting the show, meaning that commercial radio's [[Pepsi Chart (UK)|Network Chart]] overtook it in the ratings for the first time. However, the BBC denied he was being sacked. The BBC show now competes with networked commercial radio's [[The Big Top 40 Show]] which is broadcast at the same time.

Many DJs either ousted by Bannister or who left during his tenure (such as [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]] and [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]]) have joined [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] which has now overtaken Radio 1 as the UK's most popular radio station, using a style that Radio 1 had until the early 1990s.

The success of Moyles' show has come alongside increased success for the station in general. In 2006, DJs Chris Moyles, [[Scott Mills]] and [[Zane Lowe]] all won gold [[Sony Radio Awards]], while the station itself came away with the best station award.

A new evening schedule was introduced in September 2006, dividing the week by genre. Monday is mainly pop-funkrock-oriented, Tuesday is R&amp;B and hip-hop, Thursday and Friday are primarily dance, with specialist R&amp;B and reggae shows.

Following the death of [[John Peel]] in October 2004, [[Annie Nightingale]] is now the longest serving presenter, having worked there since 1970.

===40th birthday===
On 30 September 2007, Radio 1 celebrated its 40th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/established1967|title=Radio 1 Established 1967|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; To mark this anniversary Radio 1 hosted special features, including:
* Special shows hosted by music legends at 9:00pm each weekday.
* Between 9:00am and 10:00am on the [[Chris Moyles]] show, the best music from the last 40 years (a re-creation of Simon Bates' [[The Golden Hour (Radio Feature)|Golden Hour]]).
* Playing Radio 1's old jingles, which were created by PAMS productions of Dallas.
* 40 different artists performed 40 different covers, one from each year since Radio 1 was established. All 40 songs were played in the weeks leading up to the release of the [[compilation album]] ''[[Radio 1 Established 1967]]''.

===Today===
BBC Radio 1 operates a system that separates all of the DJs between 'Day' and 'Night' DJs. 
* 'Day' DJs play music generally orientated around the Radio 1 Playlist
* 'Night' DJs play more eclectic and specialised content.

The day presenters on the network on weekdays are: [[Devin Griffin|Dev]] (4AM-6:30AM), [[Chris Moyles]] (6:30AM-10AM), [[Fearne Cotton]] (10AM-12:45PM), [[Greg James (DJ)|Greg James]] (1PM-4PM), [[Scott Mills]] (4PM-7PM).

The weekend day slots now house a number of former weekday daytime presenters, including [[Edith Bowman]] (7AM-10AM), [[Vernon Kay]] (Sat 10AM-1PM), [[Sara Cox]] (Sun 10AM-1PM), [[Huw Stephens]] (1PM-4PM), [[Reggie Yates]] (4-7PM).

Weekday 'Night' DJs from 7pm until 4am play host to eclectic and specialised content that include: [[Zane Lowe]] (7-9pm) and [[Nick Grimshaw]] (10-12pm). [[Huw Stephens]], [[DJ Nihal|Nihal]], [[Annie Nightingale]], ''Rock Show with [[Daniel P Carter]]'', ''Punk Show with [[Mike Davies (broadcaster)|Mike Davies]]'', [[Kissy Sell Out]], [[Benji B]] and [[Gilles Peterson]] each have a 2 hour slot either between 12-2am or 2-4am Tuesday to Friday mornings.

Currently, between 9pm and 10pm Monday-Thursdays, there is a variety of one hour programmes including a music documentary series named ''BBC Radio 1's Stories'' on Mondays, a review show hosted by [[DJ Nihal|Nihal]] on Tuesdays, a show hosted by [[Matt Edmondson]] known as ''The Matt Edmondson Show'' on Wednesdays, and ''In New DJs We Trust'' on Thursday evenings. 

Friday evening is Radio 1's &quot;Dance Music Marathon&quot; from 7pm to 7am which consists of [[Annie Mac]] (7-9pm), [[Pete Tong]] (9-11pm), [[Judge Jules]] (11pm-1am), [[Kutski]] (1-3am), [[Essential Mix|The Essential Mix]] (3-5am) and [[Rob da Bank]] (5-7am).

Saturday evenings include 12 hours of [[urban music]] which, since October 2009, has been simulcast entirely on [[1Xtra]]. DJs include: [[Trevor Nelson]] (7-9pm), [[Tim Westwood]] (9-11pm) and [[MistaJam]] (11pm-1am). At 1am, the output changes every week offering four hours of the specialist genres of music that 1Xtra plays every weeknight from 10pm. This includes; Hip Hop, Dancehall, UKG, RnB and D&amp;B. Each week, between 1am and 3am, a programme known as ''The 1Xtra Showcase'' is aired offering one of these genres of [[urban music]]. This is followed by ''The 1Xtra Mix'' which follows with the same genre of music at 3am until 5am. Each week the theme of these shows change offering four hours of each genre once every 5 weeks in the same timeslot on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra. Every week this is followed by ''My Top 10'' and ''1Xtra's Best of the Week'' at 5am and 6am before daytime programmes resume on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra.

Sunday evenings include a magazine show hosted by ''[[Tom Deacon (comedian)|Tom Deacon]]'' (7-9pm) , advice show ''[[The Surgery with Aled]]'' (9-10pm) and a show hosted by ''[[Nick Grimshaw]] and [[Annie Mac]]'' (10-12pm). This is before specialist music takes over the station at midnight with BBC Introducing in the Nations with Jen Long in Wales, Rory McConnell in Northern Ireland and Ally McCrae in Scotland (12-2am) followed by ''Fabio and Grooverider'' (2-4am)

The licence-fee funding of Radio 1, alongside Radio 2, is often criticised by the commercial sector. In the first quarter of 2011 Radio 1 was part of an efficiency review conducted by [[John Myers (radio executive)|John Myers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tel-nov2010&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Amanda |last=Andrews |date=28 Nov 2010 |title=BBC enlists commercial sector help to shake up radio |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8164936/BBC-enlists-commercial-sector-help-to-shake-up-radio.html |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; His role, according to Andrew Harrison, the chief executive of RadioCentre, was &quot;to identify both areas of best practice and possible savings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tel-nov2010&quot;/&gt;

==Broadcast==
===Studios===

[[Image:Radio One Studio.png|thumb|alt=Scott Mills Recording his show in the BBC Radio One Studios.|right|Scott Mills presenting his show at Radio 1 HQ.]]

From inception for over 20 years, Radio 1 broadcast from an adjacent pair of continuity suites (originally Con A and Con B) in the main control room of [[Broadcasting House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.btinternet.com/~roger.beckwith/bh/cons/consb_3.htm | title = Type B Continuities | accessdate = 2009-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cons were configured to allow DJs to operate the equipment themselves and play their own records and jingle cartridges (called self-op). This was a departure from traditional BBC practice, where a studio manager would play in discs from the studio control cubicle. Due to [[needle time]] restrictions much of the music was played from tapes of BBC session recordings. The DJs were assisted by one or more technical operators (TOs) who would set up tapes and control sound levels during broadcasts.

The current studios are located in the basement of [[Yalding House]] (near to BBC Broadcasting House) which is on [[Great Portland Street]] in central [[London]]. The station moved there in 1996 from [[Egton House]], which was demolished in 2003 to make way for the extensions to [[Broadcasting House]]. When complete in 2012, Radio 1 will move to new studios in Broadcasting House.

Radio 1 also uses the BBC [[Maida Vale Studios]] in west [[London]], where artists record music sessions for various shows, including the popular [[Live Lounge]] for [[Fearne Cotton]]'s show. There are also live performances held there in front of Radio 1 competition winners.

Programmes have also regularly been broadcast from other regions, notably the [[Mark and Lard]] show, broadcast every weekday from New Broadcasting House, Oxford Road, [[Manchester]] for over a decade (October 1993-March 2004) – the longest regular broadcast on the network from outside the capital.

===UK analogue frequencies===
Radio 1 initially broadcast on 1215&amp;nbsp;kHz [[medium wave]] (or 247 metres as it was referred to at the time) and moved to 1053/1089&amp;nbsp;kHz (275/285 m) on 23 November 1978, but did not broadcast nationally on FM until 1988. The BBC was allocated three FM frequency ranges in 1955, for the then [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]] (now [[BBC Radio 2]]), [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]] (now [[BBC Radio 3]]) and [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] (now [[BBC Radio 4]]) stations. This meant when Radio 1 was launched, there was no FM frequency range allocated for the station, the official reason being that there was no space even though no commercial stations had yet launched on FM. Because of this, from launch until the early 1980s Radio 1 was allowed to take over [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2's]] FM transmitters for a few hours per week – Saturday afternoons, Sunday teatime and evening – most notably for the Top 40 Singles Chart on Sunday afternoons – and 10:00 pm to midnight on weeknights including [[Sounds of the Seventies]] until 1975, and thereafter the [[John Peel]] show.

In 1988 the 97–99&amp;nbsp;MHz frequencies became available when the existing [[police]] communication allocation changed, and Radio 1 acquired them for its own national FM network. This was rolled out as of 1 September 1988, starting with the Central Scotland, Midlands &amp; Yorkshire areas (FM broadcasts were available in London as of 31 October 1987, but this was at low power on 104.8&amp;nbsp;MHz FM – [http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/images/transmitfm_sht1.jpg see here]). Radio 1 made great efforts to promote its new FM service, renaming itself on-air initially to 'Radio 1 FM' and also later on as '1FM' until 1995.

The Conservative government then decided that to increase competition on AM it would disallow the simulcast of services available on both AM and FM. Therefore Radio 1's old medium wave frequencies were reallocated to Talk Radio UK in 1994 (now [[talkSPORT]]). Radio 1's last broadcast on MW was on 1 July that year, with [[Stephen Duffy]]'s &quot;Kiss Me&quot; being the last record played on MW just before 9:00am. In the initial months after this closure a pre-recorded message with Bruno Brookes was played to warn listeners about the fact Radio 1 was now an &quot;FM-only&quot; station, but before the pre-launch test transmissions for Talk Radio UK, the new station played out a new recorded message in the style of a 1930s/40s BBC radio announcer played out, making fun of the legislation that made the BBC have to give up their AM frequencies, saying &quot;goodbye to listeners everywhere&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio 1 transmitter AM switchoff&quot;&gt;[http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/transmitter.htm Radio Rewind], transmitter page.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time it also began broadcasting on spare audio subcarriers on [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television's]] analogue satellite service, initially in mono (on [[GOLD (TV channel)|UK Gold]]) and later in stereo (on [[Sky Living|UK Living]]).

===Digital distribution===
The BBC launched its national radio stations on [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] digital radio in 1995, however the technology was expensive at the time and so was not marketed, instead used as a test for future technologies. DAB was &quot;officially&quot; launched in 2002 as sets became cheaper. Today it can also be heard on UK digital TV services [[Freeview (United Kingdom)|Freeview]], [[Virgin Media]], [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] and the [[Internet]] as well as FM. In July 2005, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] began [[simulcast]]ing Radio 1 across the [[United States]] as channel 11 on its own service and channel 6011 on [[Dish Network]] satellite TV. [[Sirius Canada]] began simulcasting Radio 1 when it was launched on 1 December 2005 (also on channel 11). The Sirius simulcasts are [[Time shifting|time shifted]] five hours to allow U.S. and Canadian listeners in the [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Time Zone]] to hear Radio 1 at the same time of day as UK listeners. On 12 November 2008, Radio 1 made its debut on XM Satellite Radio in both the US and Canada on channel 29,{{fact|date=May 2011}} moving to XM 15 and Sirius 15 on May 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/pdf/11-524_SIR_WebLUs_5_4.pdf|title=Sirius Channel Lineup|date=2011-05-02|accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/pdf/11-524_XM_WebLUs_5_4.pdf|title=XM Channel Lineup|date=2011-05-02|accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio 1 will now reach approximately 20.6 million listeners in North America on satellite radio alone. 

BBC Radio 1 can be heard on the cable in the [[Netherlands]] at 105.10 FM.

===Regionalisation===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[BBC Northern Ireland]] --&gt;
Since 1999, Radio 1 has split the [[home nations]] for localised programming in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], to allow the broadcast of a showcase programme for regional talent.

Scotland's show is presented by [[Vic Galloway]] (who also presents for [[BBC Radio Scotland]]); he has presented the Radio 1 show on his own since 2004, after original co-host [[Gill Mills]] departed.

Northern and Eastern regions including the [[Dublin Metropolitan Area]] in the [[Republic Of Ireland]] are able to receive BBC Radio 1 on FM.

Wales's show is hosted by [[Bethan Elfyn]], who previously hosted as part of a duo with Huw Stephens,&lt;ref name=&quot;regions98&quot;&gt;[http://frequencyfinder.org.uk/r1_sched_98_04.html BBC Radio 1 schedules 1998-2004]&lt;/ref&gt; until Stephens left to join the national network (Stephens can still be heard in Wales, as he also broadcasts Welsh-language music programming on [[BBC Radio Cymru]], and hosts Radio 1's Wednesday 9pm-10pm show.)

[[Rory McConnell]] currently presents the Northern Irish programme. Before joining the national network, [[Colin Murray]] was a presenter on the Session In Northern Ireland, along with Donna Legge;&lt;ref name=&quot;regions98&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1253 'Who Is Colin Murray?', Culture Northern Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; after Murray's promotion to the network Legge hosted alone for a time, and on her departure McConnell took her place.

The regional opt-outs originally went out from 8:00pm to 10:00pm on Thursdays (the Evening Session's time slot) and were known as the Session In The Nations (the 'Session' tag was later dropped due to the demise of the Evening Session); they later moved to run from 7:30pm to 9:00pm, with the first half hour of Zane Lowe's programme going out across the whole of the UK. Since the early hours of 18 October 2007 the regional programmes have been aired Wednesday night/Thursday mornings from 12:00am to 2:00am under the '''BBC Introducing''' banner, allowing Lowe's Thursday show to be aired across the network; prior to this change Huw Stephens had presented the Wednesday midnight show nationally, and continues to host the slot in England.

This practice has also been used in Radio 1's [[T in the Park]] coverage where broadcasts to Scotland provide extended coverage of the festival which the rest of the [[United Kingdom]] does not receive (it instead has the normal Radio 1 schedule). This Scotland-only coverage has been presented by Vic Galloway in recent years.

These opt-outs are only available to listeners on the FM frequencies. Because of the way the DAB and digital TV services of Radio 1 are broadcast (a single-frequency network on DAB and a single broadcast feed of Radio 1 on TV platforms), the digital version of the station is not currently regionalised.

==Content==
===Music===
While most commercial stations concentrate on a theme, such as 1980s music or classic rock, Radio 1 plays a mix of current songs, including [[indie rock|independent]]/[[alternative rock|alternative]], [[rap]], [[hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[House music|house]], [[electronica]], [[Dance music|dance]], [[drum and bass]] and [[Pop music|pop]].

Due to restrictions on the amount of commercial music that could be played on radio in the UK until 1988 (the &quot;[[needle time]]&quot; limitation) the station has recorded many live performances and studio sessions, many of which have found their way to commercially-available LPs and CDs. The station also broadcasts documentaries and interviews. Although this type of programming arose from necessity it has given the station diversity. The needletime restrictions meant the station tended to have a higher level of speech by DJs. While the station is often criticised for &quot;waffling&quot; by presenters, an experimental &quot;more music day&quot; in 1988 was declared a failure after only a third of callers favoured it.

===News and current affairs===
{{Main|Newsbeat}}
Radio 1 has a [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public service broadcasting]] obligation to provide news, which it fulfills through [[Newsbeat]] bulletins throughout the day. Short news summaries are provided roughly hourly on the half hour during daytime hours with two 15-minute bulletins at 12:45pm and 5:45pm. The main presenter is Tulip Mazumdar. However, there are other presenters, such as [[Dominic Byrne]] who reads the news on the [[Chris Moyles Show]], Chris Smith, Debbie Randle and Simon Mundie who reads the sports news in the afternoon on the Scott Mills show.

===Notable programming===
====The Radio 1 Chart Show====
Radio 1's long-running chart show broadcasts on Sunday afternoons between 4:00pm and 7:00pm; it has always ended at 7:00pm since the station's inception, although the format, length and starting time have varied. From 15 March 1992 through 2 February 2003, the format was a countdown of all the top 40 selling singles in the UK for that week, from 40 to 1. Since that date, the show has taken on new presenters (currently [[Reggie Yates]]) and a more chat-oriented format. The show no longer plays all the top 40 singles; instead, the entire top 20 is played along with a selection of tracks between 21 and 40, interviews and other features. The chart is compiled by [[The Official UK Charts Company]]; Radio 1 is the only station to broadcast the &quot;official&quot; UK singles chart.

On 14 October 2007, [[Fearne Cotton]] and [[Reggie Yates]] replaced [[JK &amp; Joel]] as hosts of the Chart Show. [[Fearne Cotton]] became the first regular female presenter of the UK Top 40. [[Jo Whiley]] became the first female to present the UK Top 40 on 24 November 2002 (a week after [[Mark Goodier]]'s departure from the show) as a string of one-off presenters each week until Scott Mills presented the UK Top 40 each week from 5 January 2003 until 2 February 2003. [[Wes Butters]] launched the Chart Show on 9 February 2003. After this date the Chart Show was known as &quot;The Official UK Top 40.&quot; A weekly &quot;Official Chart Update&quot;, which started on 10 March 2010, also features every Wednesday between 3.30 - 4pm in the run up to the chart show on Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_10050000/newsid_10056400/10056409.stm | work=BBC News | title=Official midweek 'chart' launched | date=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weekday Breakfast Show====
{{Main|The Chris Moyles Show}}
The breakfast show has been presented by many famous names over the years (see [[Radio 1 Breakfast Show presenters]] for more details).

Currently this slot is broadcast between 6:30am and 10:00am, Monday to Friday and has been hosted since January 2004 by [[Chris Moyles]] and his team under the alternative title ''[[The Chris Moyles Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chrismoyles/ Radio 1 Online - Chris Moyles Show]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weekday Drivetime Show====
{{Main|The Scott Mills Show}}

The current weekday Drivetime show is hosted by [[Scott Mills]], under the title [[The Scott Mills Show]]. Notable former presenters include [[Sara Cox]], [[Chris Moyles]], [[Peter Powell (disc jockey)|Peter Powell]], [[Bruno Brookes]], [[Nicky Campbell]], [[Mark Goodier]], [[Kevin Greening]] and [[Dave Pearce]]. The show currently broadcasts from 4:00pm until 7:00pm every weekday, with a 15 minute break at 5:45pm for Newsbeat. [[Scott Mills]] is usually joined by assistant producer Beccy Huxtable.

====The 10 Hour Takeover====
The 10 Hour Takeover is a stunt event run on some [[Bank Holiday]] Mondays and other public holidays since 2004, the first having been aired on Easter Monday of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/djs/tenhour/easter04/ Radio 1 - Takeover playlist, Easter '04]&lt;/ref&gt; The event is a request-based special, in which the DJs on air will encourage listeners to select any available track to play. Due to the BBC's long-established and broad-scope music archive, it is often possible for a wide range of songs to be played, and as such the mix of music played may be more diverse than that on a normal weekday.

====The Tinsel Takeover====
In 2009 and 2010 around 25 Radio 1 listeners were invited to record their own 15 minute show to be broadcast on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]], with the show containing a selection of songs and discussion about a chosen subject.

====Radio 1's Longest Show Ever====
On 18 March 2011, BBC's Radio 1 longest serving breakfast DJ [[Chris Moyles]] and sidekick [[Comedy Dave|Dave Vitty]] broadcast for 52 hours as part of a [[Guinness World Records|Guiness World Record]] attempt, in aid of [[Comic Relief]]. The pair stayed on air for 52 hours in total setting a new world record for ‘Radio DJ Endurance Marathon (Team)’ after already breaking [[Simon Mayo]]'s 12-year record for Radio 1's Longest Show of 37 hours which he set in 1999, also for Comic Relief.

The presenters started on 16 March 2011 and came off air at 10:30am on 18 March 2011. During this Fearne Cotton made a bet with DJ Chris Moyles that if they raise over £2,000,000 she will appear on the show in a swimsuit. After passing the £2,000,000 mark, Cotton appeared on the studio webcam in a stripy monochrome swimsuit. The appearance of Cotton between 10:10am and 10:30am caused the Radio 1 website to crash due to a high volume of traffic.

In total the event raised £2,622,421 for Comic Relief.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chrismoyles/longestshow/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Line Up ==

==Public events==
{{Main|Radio 1's Big Weekend}}
;Radio 1 Roadshows
The [[Radio 1 Roadshow]], which usually involved Radio 1 DJs and pop stars travelling around popular UK seaside destinations, began in 1973, hosted by [[Alan Freeman]] in [[Newquay]], [[Cornwall]], with the final one held at [[Heaton Park]], [[Manchester]] in 1999. Although the Roadshow style changed with the style of the station itself&amp;mdash;such as the introduction of whistlestop audio postcards of each location in 1994 (&quot;2minuteTour&quot;)&amp;mdash;they were still considered rooted in the &quot;cheesy&quot; old style of the station, and, in the 1980s, they sometimes featured elements which would be seen as highly [[political incorrectness|politically incorrect]] today, such as wet T-shirt contests.

;Radio 1's Big Weekend
In March 2000, Radio 1 decided to change the Roadshow format, renaming it ''One Big Sunday'' in the process. Several of these ''Sundays'' were held in large city-centre parks. In 2003, the event changed again and was rebranded ''[[Radio 1's Big Weekend|One Big Weekend]]'', with each event occurring biannually and covering two days. Under this name, it visited [[Derry]] in [[Northern Ireland]], as part of the ''Music Lives'' campaign, and [[Perry Park (Birmingham)|Perry Park]] in [[Birmingham]].

The most recent change occurred in 2005 when the event was yet again renamed and the decision taken to hold only one per year, this time as [[Radio 1's Big Weekend]]. Venues under this title have included [[Herrington|Herrington Country Park]], [[Camperdown Country Park]], [[Moor Park, Preston|Moor Park]]&amp;ndash;which was the first ''Weekend'' to feature a third stage&amp;ndash;[[Mote Park]] and [[Lydiard Park]].

Tickets for each ''Big Weekend'' are given away free of charge, making it the largest free ticketed music festival in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/|title=Radio 1 announced line-up for One Big Weekend, Preston|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend will be replaced by a larger festival in 2012, named 'Radio 1's Hackney Weekend', with a crowd capacity of 100,000. The event is to take place over the weekend of 23-24 June 2012 in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], Central London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/events/hackneyweekend2012&lt;/ref&gt;

;Radio 1 Switch Live
The first ever [[BBC Switch]] Live was held on 12 October 2008 at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]]. With performances from [[McFly]], [[Fall out Boy]], [[Ne-Yo]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Basshunter]], [[N-Dubz]] and [[George Sampson]]. The event was hosted by [[Annie Mac]], [[Nick Grimshaw]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], [[Fearne Cotton]], [[Greg James (DJ)|Greg James]] and [[Tom Deacon (Comedian)|Tom Deacon]]. The event was strictly for 14 to 17 years only and was recorded for BBC Switch's show ''Sound'' which is shown on [[BBC Two]] and is presented by [[Annie Mac]] and [[Nick Grimshaw]].

;Other events
On 18 July 2008, Radio 1 broadcast live from BCM Square, [[Magaluf]], [[Mallorca]] as part of their Summer Season 2008. The broadcast started at 4:00pm with [[Greg James (DJ)|Greg James]] and [[Judge Jules]] presenting. Then from 7:00pm to 9:00pm it was back to the London Studio with [[Pete Tong]], and from 9:00pm to 11:00pm it was [[Kissy Sell Out]] standing in for [[Annie Mac]] with Annie Mac's Mash Up. Then at 11:00pm it was back to Mallorca for Dave Pearce's Dance Anthems. At 1:00am Judge Jules was back to end the night in the BCM Night Club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/summer/2008/mallorca/index.shtml BBC - Radio 1 - Summer 2008 - Mallorca&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The service was launched in 1999 as BBC Text.  It was relaunched in November 2001 under the '''BBCi''' brand and operated under this name until 2008, when it was once more rebranded as BBC Red Button.  The &quot;red button&quot; name refers to the common interface on [[remote control]]s for digital televisions and [[set-top box]]es, a red button, which launches digital teletext services.

===BBC Text===
BBC Text originally launched on digital terrestrial services in 1999, and was later introduced on satellite and cable platforms.  In the first phase, the service was created using content migrated from the existing analogue teletext service, Ceefax.  A digital text service had been available since the launch of digital terrestrial television in November 1998, but the BBC Text service was not publicly launched until November 1999, due to a lack of availability of compatible set-top boxes.
&lt;ref name=&quot;RDreview2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/annual-review/rev_00/bbcrdar00part3.pdf|title=Digital Broadcasting - BBC R&amp;D Annual Review 1999-2000|year=2000|publisher=BBC Research &amp; Development|pages=49–50|accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC Text was considerably more advanced than Ceefax, in that it offered a richer visual interface, with the possibility of photographic images and designed graphics (as opposed to Ceefax graphics which were composed of simple blocks of colour). BBC Text also enabled channel association, the ability for the user to retain their selected television channel visible in one section of the screen whilst viewing the text service, in contrast to Ceefax, which could only be viewed as a full-screen display, or as a semitransparent overlay above the television picture. The original text service had no return path, this being made available in later phases.

BBC Text pioneered an early form of &quot;[[Video on demand|on-demand]]&quot; [[interactive television]], called Enhanced TV. During the [[1999 Wimbledon Championships]], the BBC presented a service which allowed viewers to select a video stream of different matches, and access additional information such as player profiles, scores and interactive quizzes. Although the experimental service was publicly available, there were no digital set-top boxes or receivers available on the market which could decode the signal and the service was only presented to the public via BBC demonstrations using prototype receivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;RDreview2000&quot;/&gt;

===The BBCi brand===
[[Image:BBCi-bar TV.jpg|thumb|right|200px|BBCi TV i-bar, 2001]]
[[Image:Bbci website jan 2004.jpg|thumb|right|200px|BBCi website navbar, 2004]]
The BBCi brand launched in 2001 and was conceived as a cohesive [[multi-platform]] brand name for all the BBC's digital interactive services, encompassing the corporation's digital teletext, interactive television and website services.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcsnews0711&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1643259.stm|title=BBCi heralds new interactive era|date=2001-11-07|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whatisBBCi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20011215000308/www.bbc.co.uk/home/whatisbbci/|title=What is BBCi?|date=2002-12-15|publisher=BBC (sourced via Web Archive)|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of letter &quot;i&quot; [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es to denote information technology or interactivity was very much in vogue at this time, notably with the launch of the [[iMac]] and the [[iPod]] by [[Apple Computer]]; according to the BBC, the &quot;i&quot; in BBCi stood for &quot;interactivity&quot; as well as &quot;innovation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1101&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/nov/12/mondaymediasection.bbc1|title=A fresh i for BBC|last=Gibson|first=Owen|date=2001-11-12|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various services all took on a common interface device, an &quot;i-bar&quot; branded with the BBCi logo, which sought to emphasise the brand across different technologies by providing similar navigation.  For example, the [[BBC Online|BBC website]], which had previously been called BBC Online, took on the BBCi brand from 2001, displaying an i-bar across the top of every page, offering a category-based navigation: Categories, TV, Radio, Communicate, Where I Live, A-Z Index, and a search.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwwibar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20011215101431/www.bbc.co.uk/home/whatisbbci/on_web.shtml|title=What is BBCi? - On the web|date=2002-12-15|publisher=BBC (sourced via Web Archive)|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, BBC interactive television services all offered a horizontal i-bar along the bottom of television screens, with four colour-coded interactions linked to the four colour buttons on TV remote controls.

After three years of consistent use across different platforms, the BBC began to drop the BBCi brand gradually; on 6 May 2004, the BBC website was renamed [[BBC Online|bbc.co.uk]], after the main [[URL]] used to access the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbccouk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/05_may/04/bbc_co_uk.shtml|title=BBC website gets new look and new name: bbc.co.uk|date=2004-05-04|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interactive TV services continued under the BBCi brand until late 2008.

Today, the broadcaster's online video player, the [[BBC iPlayer]], reflects the branding legacy by retaining an i-prefix in its branding.

===The BBC Red Button brand===
From 2008, the BBC gradually began to drop the BBCi name from its digital interactive TV services also, replacing it with the name BBC Red Button.  The BBCi logo continued in on-screen presentation for some time.

In November 2008, the BBC celebrated 10 years of the digital interactive TV service.&lt;ref name=&quot;10years&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/11_november/06/button.shtml|title=BBC's Red Button celebrates its 10th anniversary|date=2008-11-06|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
BBC Red Button is broadcast on all digital television platforms in the UK, including [[digital cable]] ([[DVB-C]]), [[IPTV]] ([[TalkTalk TV]] - channel 503, no red button or teletext), digital [[satellite television|satellite]] ([[DVB-S]]) (''[[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]]'' &amp; ''[[Freesat]]'') and [[digital terrestrial television]] ([[DVB-T]]) (''[[Freeview (United Kingdom)|Freeview]]'').  On Freeview Channel 301, interactivity does not permit users to submit data (such as answering questions in a quiz or requesting [[video on demand]]), as the platform does not provide a [[return path]].
The BBC red button service is also available in the Republic of Ireland by watching &quot;BBC1 NI&quot; on SKY epg no. 141.

==Content==
Generally, BBC Red Button offers text and video based services, as well as enhanced television programmes which offer extra information, video or quizzes.

In September 2005, BBCi launched an update to the interactivity available from the [[BBC Radio|BBC's Radio]] channels on Freeview.  Originally only Radiotext was available.  After the update, users could access information about the programme, schedules, news, sport and weather.  From 2005, Freeview users could access the CBBC Extra video stream.

The same team behind the BBC's digital text service also launched the early incarnations of the BBC's Interactive Wimbledon and Interactive Open Golf services in 2000, which were awarded an Interactive [[BAFTA]] that year.

The News Multiscreen was removed from the digital service in October 2009, to make room for future Freeview HD broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2009/10/change_to_freeview.html BBC - The Editors: Closing the News Multiscreen] Pete Clifton.

==Compatibility==
The service is still compatible with '''ONdigital''' and [[ITV Digital]] boxes, though loading speeds are slower than newer Freeview boxes.  The BBC has not announced if support for the older boxes would be discontinued.  The [[Teletext Ltd.|''Teletext'']] service from the UK commercial broadcasters had stopped supporting the old boxes in 2005. As of 2010, the ONdigital boxes only load pages 100 and 199 and some interactive services that use channel 301, if any other page is loaded it exits the service.

Page numbers were introduced in 2004 to aid navigation, with 3-digit page numbers matching with those of the analogue Ceefax in 2006.  Pages exclusive to digital are given a four digit number.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:PICMG-Backplane-Details.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Major Components on a PICMG 1.3 Active Backplane]]
A '''backplane''' (or &quot;backplane system&quot;) is a circuit board (usually a [[printed circuit board]]) that connects several [[electrical connector|connectors]] in parallel to each other, so that each [[pin]] of each connector is linked to the same relative pin of all the other connectors forming a [[computer bus]].  It is used as a [[backbone network|backbone]] to connect several printed circuit boards together to make up a complete [[computer system]]. Early [[personal computer]]s like the [[Apple II family|Apple II]] and the [[IBM PC]] integrated an internal backplane for [[expansion card]]s {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. 
While a [[motherboard]] may include a backplane, the backplane is actually a separate entity. A backplane is generally differentiated from a motherboard by the lack of on-board processing and storage elements.

Backplanes are normally used in preference to cables because of their greater [[Reliability engineering|reliability]].  In a cabled system, the cables need to be flexed every time that a card is added to or removed from the system; and this flexing eventually causes mechanical failures.  A backplane does not suffer from this problem, so its service life is limited only by the longevity of its connectors.  For example, the [[DIN 41612]] connectors used in the [[VMEbus]] system can withstand 50 to 500 insertions and removals (called ''mating cycles''), depending on their quality.

In addition, there are bus expansion cables which will extend a computer bus to an external backplane, usually located in an enclosure, to provide more or different slots than the host computer provides.  These cable sets have a transmitter board located in the computer, an expansion board in the remote backplane, and a cable between the two.

==Active versus Passive backplanes==
[[Image:ISA-Backplane.jpg|thumb|right|300px|ISA Passive Backplane showing connectors and parallel signal traces on back side. Only components are connectors, capacitors and voltage indicator LEDs.]]
Backplanes have grown in complexity from the simple [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] (used in the original [[IBM PC]]) or [[S-100 bus|S-100]] style where all the connectors were connected to a common bus.  
Because of limitations inherent in the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] specification for driving slots, backplanes are now offered as '''passive''' and '''active''' though the general usage is referred to as '''passive''' even when active components are present in the bus. 

True passive backplanes offer no active bus driving circuitry. Any desired arbitration logic is placed on the daughter cards. Active backplanes include chips which [[Buffer (computer science)|buffer]] the various signals to the slots.

The distinction between the two isn't always very clear, but may become an important issue if a whole system is expected to have no [[single point of failure]]. A passive backplane, even if it ''is'' single, is not usually considered a [[Single point of failure|SPOF]]. Active backplanes are more complicated and thus have a non-zero risk of malfunction.

==Backplanes Versus Motherboards==
When a backplane is used with a plug-in [[single board computer]] (SBC) or [[System Host Board|system host board]] (SHB), the combination provides the same functionallity as a [[motherboard]] providing processing power, memory, I/O and slots for plug-in cards.  While there are a few motherboards that offer more than 8 slots, that is the traditional limit.  In addition, as technology progresses, the availability and number of a particular slot type may be limited in terms of what is currently offered by motherboard manufacturers.  

On the other hand, backplane architecture is somewhat unrelated to the SBC technology that is plugged into it.  There are some limitations to what can be constructed in that the SBC chip set and processor have to provide the capability of supporting the slot types.  In addition, virtually an unlimited number of slots can be provided with 20, including the SBC slot, as a practical though not an absolute limit.  Thus, a PICMG backplane can provide any number and any mix of ISA, PCI, PCI-X, and PCI-e slots limited only by the ability of the SBC to interface to and drive those slots.  For example, an SBC with the latest i7 processor could interface with a backplane providing up to 19 ISA slots to drive legacy I/O cards.

==Butterfly Backplanes==
Some backplanes are constructed with slots on both sides.  These are not the same as midplane backplanes.  A butterfly backplane is typically constructed to maximize the number of slots for the least vertical height. The backplane would be mounted vertically in a chassis oriented front to back and the plug-in SBC and cards would lay flat, protruding out both sides of the backplane.  This, for example, allows the use of up to four full height boards in a 2U chassis.

==Backplanes in storage==
Servers commonly have a backplane to attach hot swappable hard drives, backplane pins passing directly into hard drive sockets without cables. They may have single connector to connect one [[disk array controller]] or multiple connectors that can be connected to one or more controllers in arbitrary way. Backplanes are commonly found in [[disk enclosure]]s, [[disk array]]s, and [[Server (computing)|server]]s.

Backplanes for SAS and SATA HDDs most commonly use the [[SGPIO]] protocol as means of communication between the [[host adapter|HBA]] and the backplane. Alternatively [[SCSI Enclosure Services]] can be used. With [[Parallel SCSI]] subsystems, [[SAF-TE]] is used in computers, mostly in [[blade server]]s, where server blades reside on one side and the peripheral (power, networking, and other I/O) and service modules reside on the other. Midplanes are also popular in networking and telecommunications equipment where one side of the chassis accepts system processing cards and the other side of the chassis accepts network interface cards.

== Platforms ==
=== PICMG ===
[[Image:SBC-Backplane.jpg|thumb|right|300px|PICMG 1.3 Single Board Computer (SHB) in Active Backplane]]

A Single Board Computer meeting the PICMG 1.3 specification and compatible with a PICMG 1.3 backplane is referred to as a [[System Host Board]].

In the Intel Single Board Computer world, [[PICMG]] provides standards for the backplane interface:
PICMG 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picmgeu.org/specs/available_specifications.htm PICMG 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2]&lt;/ref&gt; provide for ISA and PCI support with 1.2 adding PCIX support.
PICMG 1.3&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picmgeu.org/specs/available_specifications.htm PICMG 1.3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picmg.org/v2internal/SHB_Express.htm PICMG 1.3 SHB Express Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; provides for PCI-Express support.

[[Image:BandRegalBaldric.png|thumb|Army band baldric]]
[[Image:AdamclisiMetope.jpg|thumb|A cavalryman wearing a mail shirt with a baldric over his right shoulder.]]
A '''baldric''' (also '''baldrick''', '''bawdrick''', '''bauldrick''' as well as some other, mostly rare or obsolete, variations) is a [[belt (clothing)|belt]] worn over one [[shoulder]] that is typically used to carry a [[weapon]] (usually a [[sword]]) or other implement such as a [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]] or [[drum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/86/B0038600.html baldric. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Baldric Baldric - LoveToKnow 1911&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The word may also refer to any belt in general, but this usage is poetic and not considered standard. 

Baldrics have been used since ancient times.  The design offers more support for weight than a standard waist belt, without restricting movement of the arms, and allowing easy access to the object carried.  The use of baldrics is traditionally military, but may fill a ceremonial role rather than a practical one.  Many non-military or paramilitary organizations include baldrics as part of ceremonial dress.  The [[Knights of Columbus]] 4th Degree Color Corps uses a baldric as part of their uniform; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kofcsupplies.com/ccp0-catshow/4thdegreecolorcorps.html 4th Degree Color Corps&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carr.org/~meripper/kofc/assembly/regalia.asp Knights of Columbus, Emblem, Jewels, and Regalia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it supports a ceremonial sword.

The University of Illinois marching band, the Marching Illini, wore two baldrics as a part of their uniform until 2009, with one over each shoulder.  They crossed in the front and back and were buttoned onto the jacket beneath a cape and epaulets.

==Roman balteus==
During [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman times]] the '''balteus'''  (plural ''baltei'') was a type of baldric commonly used to suspend a [[sword]]. It was a belt generally worn over the shoulder, passing obliquely down to the side, typically made of leather, often ornamented with precious stones, metals or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Balteus.html |title=Baʹlteus from a Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities |page=196 |author=William Smith |location=London |year=1875 |accessdate=4 December 2010 |publisher=John Murray }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a similar belt worn by the Romans, particularly by soldiers, called a ''cintus'' (pl. ''cinti'') that fastened around the waist. The word ''accintus'' meaning a soldier (literally, &quot;girt&quot; as for battle) attests this differing usage.

== The baldric in popular culture ==
* Benedick, from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', says &quot;But that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldric all women shall pardon me.&quot;
* A baldric features prominently in Chapter 2 of [[Alexandre Dumas, père]]'s ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', in which D'Artagnan has his nearly-disastrous first encounters with Porthos (who is wearing one), Aramis, and Athos.
* The yeoman in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]] ''is described as wearing a &quot;baldrick of bright green.&quot;
* [[Jean-Luc Picard]] admonishes [[Worf]] in ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'': &quot;Straighten your baldric&quot;. Indeed, the character of Worf was wearing a baldric in almost every one of his appearances through two series and four films. Other [[Klingon]]s are also seen wearing them on occasion.
* The baldric of [[Pallas (son of Evander)|Pallas]] plays a key part in the [[Aeneid]], leading Aeneas to kill Turnus.
* &quot;On a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees.&quot; (A reference to [[Boromir]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'')
* In [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]] Gawain returns from his battle with the Green Knight wearing the green girdle &quot;obliquely, like a baldric, bound at his side,/ below his left shoulder, laced in a knot, in betokening the blame he had borne for his fault.&quot;
* The costume of the character [[He-Man]] from [[Masters of the Universe]] includes a baldric.
* [[Baldrick]] is a character in the [[BBC]] comedy series ''[[Blackadder]] ''played by [[Tony Robinson]].
* A [[Sam Browne belt]] is a modern invention similar in function to the baldric.
* A [[bandolier]] is a belt worn in a similar fashion, used to carry ammunition for firearms.
* In [[Morris Dancing]] a baldric is one of a crossed pair of sashes or ribbons, one worn over each shoulder.
* [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]'s 19th-century poem ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]'' contains the lines
: ''And from his blazon’d '''baldric''' slung''
: ''A mighty silver bugle hung,'' [http://quotations.about.com/cs/poemlyrics/a/Lady_Of_Shalott.htm]
* Baldric is the name of one of the [[raven |ravens ]] presently residing at [[The Tower of London]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrp.org.uk/Resources/Ravens%20leaflet.pdf Ravens leaflet]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Richard Rahl carries [[The Sword of Truth]] on a baldric in [[Terry Goodkind]]'s [[High fantasy|epic fantasy]] series of the same name.
* During the Future episode of [[QI]] (series F, episode 9), [[Stephen Fry]] wears a [[Klingon]] Baldric.

The '''Battle of Waterloo''' was fought on Sunday 18 June 1815 near [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] in present-day [[Belgium]], then part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]].  An [[First French Empire|Imperial French]] army under the command of [[Emperor of the French|Emperor]] [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] was defeated by combined armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]], an Anglo-Allied army under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] combined with a [[Prussia]]n army under the command of [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Gebhard von Blücher]]. It was the culminating battle of the [[Hundred Days#Waterloo Campaign|Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. The defeat at Waterloo put an end to Napoleon's rule as Emperor of the French and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]]' return from exile.

Upon Napoleon's return to power in 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Two large forces under Wellington and von Blücher assembled close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon chose to attack in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the Coalition. The decisive engagement of this three-day Waterloo Campaign (16–19 June 1815) occurred at the Battle of Waterloo. According to Wellington, the battle was &quot;the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon delayed giving battle until noon on 18 June to allow the ground to dry. Wellington's army, positioned across the Brussels road on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] [[escarpment]], withstood repeated attacks by the French, until, in the evening, the Prussians arrived in force and broke through Napoleon's right flank. At that moment, Wellington's Anglo-allied army counter-attacked and drove the French army in disorder from the field. Pursuing Coalition forces entered France and restored [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] to the French throne. Napoleon abdicated, surrendered to the British, and was exiled to [[Saint Helena]], where he died in 1821.

The battlefield is in present-day Belgium, about eight miles (12&amp;nbsp;km) SSE of [[Brussels]], and about a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) from the town of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]]. The site of the battlefield is today dominated by a large monument, the [[Butte du Lion|Lion Mound]]. As this mound used earth from the battlefield itself, the original topography of the part of the battlefield around the mound has not been preserved.

==Prelude==
{{Main|Waterloo Campaign}}
On 13 March 1815, six days before Napoleon reached Paris, the powers at the [[Congress of Vienna]] [[s:Declaration at the Congress of Vienna|declared him an outlaw]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/napoleon/time7.html Timeline: The Congress of Vienna, the Hundred Days, and Napoleon's Exile on St Helena], Center of Digital Initiatives, [[Brown University]] Library&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] mobilized armies to defeat Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton-Williams, David p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon knew that once his attempts at dissuading one or more of the [[Seventh Coalition]] allies from invading France had failed, his only chance of remaining in power was to attack before the Coalition mobilised. If he could destroy the existing Coalition forces south of Brussels before they were reinforced, he might be able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war.  An additional consideration was that there were many French-speaking sympathizers in Belgium and a French victory might trigger a friendly revolution there.  Also, the British troops in Belgium were largely second-line troops; most of the veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to America to fight the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|300px|left|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]
Wellington's initial dispositions were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This would have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]], but would have pushed his army closer to Blücher's. Napoleon manipulated Wellington's fear of this loss of his supply chain from the channel ports with false intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|2005|pp= 136–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; He divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]], and a reserve, which he commanded personally (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another). Crossing the frontier near [[Charleroi]] before dawn on 15 June, the French rapidly overran Coalition outposts, securing Napoleon's &quot;central position&quot; between Wellington's and Blücher's armies.

[[File:Napoleon crop.jpg|thumb|The resurgent [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] strategy was to isolate the Allied and Prussian armies, and annihilate each one separately]]
Only very late on the night of 15 June was Wellington certain that the Charleroi attack was the main French thrust. In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]], and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=508}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ney's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that, if necessary, he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon.

Napoleon moved against the concentrated Prussian army first. On 16 June, with a part of the reserve and the right wing of the army, he attacked and defeated Blücher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]]. The Prussian centre gave way under more heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. Ney, meanwhile, found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who successfully repelled Ney's initial attacks, but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements and then Wellington himself arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, but too late to send help to the Prussians, who were defeated at the [[Battle of Ligny]] on the same day. The Prussian defeat made Wellington's position at Quatre Bras untenable, so the next day he withdrew northwards, to a defensive position he had personally [[reconnaissance|reconnoitred]] the previous year—the low [[ridge]] of Mont-Saint-Jean, south of the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] and the [[Sonian Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=527}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prussian retreat from Ligny went uninterrupted, and seemingly unnoticed, by the French.&lt;ref name=Chesney-136&gt;{{Harvnb|Chesney|1907|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of their rearguard units held their positions until about midnight, and some elements did not move out until the following morning, completely ignored by the French.&lt;ref name=Chesney-136/&gt; Crucially, the Prussians did not retreat to the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, they too fell back northwards—parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance, and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow|Von Bülow's]] IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny, and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].&lt;ref name=Chesney-136/&gt;

Napoleon, with the reserves, made a late start on 17 June and joined Ney at Quatre Bras at 13:00 to attack Wellington's army, but found the position empty. The French pursued Wellington, but the result was only a brief cavalry skirmish in [[Genappe]] just as torrential rain set in for the night. Before leaving Ligny, Napoleon ordered Grouchy, commander of the right wing, to follow up the retreating Prussians with 33,000&amp;nbsp;men. A late start, uncertainty about the direction the Prussians had taken, and the vagueness of the orders given to him meant that Grouchy was too late to prevent the Prussian army reaching [[Wavre]], from where it could march to support Wellington. By the end of 17 June, Wellington's army had arrived at its position at Waterloo, with the main body of Napoleon's army following. Blücher's army was gathering in and around Wavre, around eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) to the east of the city.

{{Main|Order of Battle of the Waterloo Campaign}}
Three armies were involved in the battle: Napoleon's ''Armée du Nord''; a multinational army under Wellington; and a Prussian army under Blücher. The French army of around 69,000 consisted of 48,000 infantry, 14,000 cavalry, and 7,000 artillery with 250 guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon had used conscription to fill the ranks of the French army throughout his rule, but he did not conscript men for the 1815 campaign. All his troops were veterans of at least one campaign who had returned more or less voluntarily to the colours. The cavalry in particular was both numerous and formidable, and included fourteen regiments of armoured [[heavy cavalry]] and seven of highly versatile [[lancers]]. Neither Coalition army had any armoured troops at all, and Wellington had only a handful of lancers.

Wellington claimed he had &quot;an infamous army, very weak and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced Staff&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; His troops consisted of 67,000&amp;nbsp;men: 50,000&amp;nbsp;infantry, 11,000&amp;nbsp;cavalry, and 6,000&amp;nbsp;artillery with 150&amp;nbsp;guns. Of these, 25,000 were British, with another 6,000 from the [[King's German Legion]]. All of the [[British Army]] troops were regular soldiers and 7,000 of them were [[Peninsular War]] veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=484}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there were 17,000&amp;nbsp;Dutch and Belgian troops, 11,000 from [[House of Hanover|Hanover]], 6,000 from [[Brunswick-Lüneburg#Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Brunswick]], and 3,000 from [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=75–76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:YoungwilliamII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[William II of the Netherlands|William, Prince of Orange]] showed personal bravery in the battle.]]

Many of the troops in the Coalition armies were inexperienced.&lt;ref&gt;An artillery captain, Mercer, thought the Brunswickers &quot;perfect children&quot; {{Harv|Mercer|1870|loc=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On 13 June, the commandant at [[Ath]] requested powder and cartridges as members of a Hanoverian reserve regiment there had never yet fired a shot {{Harv|Longford|1971|p=486}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch army had been re-established in 1815, following the earlier defeat of Napoleon. With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to Napoleonic regime. Wellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command, the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000&amp;nbsp;troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], eight miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) away to the west; they were not recalled to participate in the battle but were to serve as a fall back position should the battle be lost. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under [[William II of the Netherlands|William, Prince of Orange]]'s younger brother [[Prince Frederik of the Netherlands]].

The Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813–14 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|2005|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance – guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle. Offsetting these handicaps, however, the Prussian Army did have excellent and professional leadership in its General Staff organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle at 24&amp;nbsp;hours' notice. After Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|2005|pp=60–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000&amp;nbsp;men, were engaged at Waterloo – two brigades under [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow|Friedrich von Bülow]], commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl von Zieten|Zieten's]] I Corps and parts of [[Georg Dubislav Ludwig von Pirch|Georg von Pirch's]] II Corps engaged at about 18:00.

==Battlefield==
[[Image:Waterloo Butte du Lion JPG1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The famous ''morne plaine'' described by [[Victor Hugo]] and the Lion Mound.]]
The Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east – west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was a large elm tree that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road. Using the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his skirmishers and artillery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=78,79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at two and a half miles (4&amp;nbsp;km). This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the château, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (or hollow way) along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of Papelotte. Both Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's flanks securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the [[King's German Legion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parry|1900|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
This position presented a formidable challenge to an attacker. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position; any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the streets and hedgerows of Papelotte, and some very wet ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=141,235}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I&amp;nbsp;Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000&amp;nbsp;infantry and 1,500&amp;nbsp;cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honoré Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000&amp;nbsp;infantry, and 1,300&amp;nbsp;cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI&amp;nbsp;Corps with 6,000&amp;nbsp;men, the 13,000&amp;nbsp;infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=83–85}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
[[File:Blücher (nach Gebauer).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher]], who had led one of the coalition armies defeating Napoleon at the [[Battle of Leipzig]], commanded the Prussian army]]
Wellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Blücher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Blücher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Blücher's chief of staff [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]] had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Blücher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Blücher, promising to support him with three corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|pp=535,536}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under Bülow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the [[Battle of Ligny]]. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and Bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move up  88&amp;nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped by a fire which broke out in Wavre and blocked several streets along Bülow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. Bülow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When Soult suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, &quot;Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Napoleon's surprisingly dismissive statements should not be taken at face value, given the Emperor's maxim that &quot;in war, morale is everything&quot; and that praising the enemy is always wrong, as it reduces one's morale. Indeed, he had been seen engaging in such pre-battle, morale-boosting harangues on a number of occasions in the past and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo he had to deal with his chief of staff's pessimism and nervousness and had to respond to several persistent and almost defeatist objections from some of his senior generals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2001|pp=163–166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, being told by his brother, [[Jérôme Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at  lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start irrupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]
Napoleon had delayed the start of the battle due to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to &quot;head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]&quot; and then &quot;push before him&quot; the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292,293}}&lt;/ref&gt; To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A [[Grand Battery|''grande batterie'']] of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=95–98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Andrieux - La bataille de Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Clément-Auguste Andrieux]]'s 1852 ''The Battle of Waterloo'']]
The historian Andrew Roberts notes that &quot;It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at &quot;about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wellesley|1815|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources state that the attack began around 11:30.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The hour at which Waterloo began, though there were 150,000&amp;nbsp;actors in the great tragedy, was long a matter of dispute. The Duke of Wellington puts it at 10:00. General Alava says half-past eleven, Napoleon and Drouet say noon, and Ney 13:00. Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of [[Foot Guards|Guards]], and the wood and park by Hanoverian [[Jäger (military)|''Jäger'']] and the 1/2nd&lt;ref&gt;That is, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Regiment. Among Prussian regiments, &quot;F/12th&quot; denoted the fusilier battalion of the 12th Regiment.&lt;/ref&gt; Nassau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=113–114}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial attack by Bauduin's brigade emptied the wood and park, but was driven back by heavy British artillery fire, and cost Bauduin his life. As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Some French troops managed to enter its courtyard before the gate was resecured. The 2nd [[Coldstream Guards]] and 2/3rd Foot Guards then arrived and repulsed the attack.

Fighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,&lt;ref name=Barbero298&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.&lt;br /&gt; Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost,&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were  relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Foot]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett|Hugh Halkett's]] 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out until the end of the battle.

{{quote|When I reached Lloyd's abandoned guns, I stood near them for about a minute to contemplate the scene: it was grand beyond description. Hougoumont and its wood sent up a broad flame through the dark masses of smoke that overhung the field; beneath this cloud the French were indistinctly visible. Here a waving mass of long red feathers could be seen; there, gleams as from a sheet of steel showed that the cuirassiers were moving; 400&amp;nbsp;cannon were belching forth fire and death on every side; the roaring and shouting were indistinguishably commixed—together they gave me an idea of a labouring volcano. Bodies of infantry and cavalry were pouring down on us, and it was time to leave contemplation, so I moved towards our columns, which were standing up in square.|Major Macready, Light Division, 30th British Regiment, Halkett's brigade|&lt;ref name=Creasy-XV&gt;{{Harvnb|Creasy|1877|loc=[http://www.standin.se/fifteen15a.htm Chapter XV]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The fighting at Hougoumont has often been characterised as a diversionary attack to draw in Wellington's reserves but which escalated into an all-day battle and drew in French reserves instead.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Harvnb|Longford|1971|pp=552–554}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact there is a good case to believe that both Napoleon and Wellington thought that holding Hougoumont was key to winning the battle. Hougoumont was a part of the battlefield that Napoleon could see clearly,&lt;ref name=Barbero298/&gt; and he continued to direct resources towards it and its surroundings all afternoon (33&amp;nbsp;battalions in all, 14,000&amp;nbsp;troops). Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21&amp;nbsp;battalions (12,000&amp;nbsp;troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=305,306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and later stated that &quot;the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First French infantry attack===
[[Image:Battle of Waterloo.svg|thumb|300px|Map of the battle. [[Napoleon]]'s units are in blue, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s in red, [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]]'s in grey.]]

The 80 guns of Napoleon's ''grande batterie'' drew up in the centre. These opened fire at 11:50, according to [[Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill|Lord Hill]] (commander of the Anglo-allied II Corps),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}, &quot;Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired&amp;nbsp;... At ten minutes to twelve the first heavy gun rang sullenly from the French ridge&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources put the time between noon and 13:30.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''grande batterie'' was too far back to aim accurately, and the only other troops they could see were part of the Dutch division (the others were employing Wellington's characteristic &quot;[[reverse slope defence]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=Barbero-130&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the soft ground prevented the cannon balls from bouncing far, and the French gunners covered Wellington's entire deployment, so the density of hits was low. The idea was not to cause a large amount of physical damage, however, but in the words of Napoleon's orders, &quot;to astonish the enemy and shake his morale&quot;.&lt;ref name=Barbero-130/&gt;

At about 13:00, Napoleon saw the first columns of Prussians around the village of [[Lasne-Chapelle-Saint-Lambert]], four or five miles (three hours' march for an army) away from his right flank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's reaction was to have Marshal Soult send a message to Grouchy telling him to come towards the battlefield and attack the arriving Prussians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Grouchy, however, had been executing Napoleon's previous orders to follow the Prussians &quot;with your sword against his back&quot; towards Wavre, and was by then too far away to reach Waterloo. Grouchy was advised by his subordinate, [[Étienne Maurice Gérard|Gérard]], to &quot;march to the sound of the guns&quot;, but stuck to his orders and engaged the Prussian III Corps rear guard under the command of [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Baron]] [[Johann von Thielmann]] at the [[Battle of Wavre]]. Moreover, Soult's letter ordering Grouchy to move quickly to join Napoleon and attack Bulow wouldn't actually reach Grouchy until after 18:00.

A little after 13:00, I Corps' attack began. D'Erlon, like Ney, had encountered Wellington in Spain, and was aware of the British commander's favoured tactic of using massed short-range musketry to drive off infantry columns. Rather than use the usual nine-deep French columns deployed abreast of one another, therefore, each division advanced in closely spaced battalion lines behind one another. This allowed them to concentrate their fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not leave room for them to change formation.

The formation was initially effective. Its leftmost division, under Donzelot, advanced on La Haye Sainte. While one battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of [[cuirassiers]], succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The Prince of Orange saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off, and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian Lüneberg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes, and then rode on past La Haye Sainte almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.

At about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&amp;nbsp;men over a front of about &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;1,000&amp;nbsp;metres&amp;nbsp;(1,094&amp;nbsp;yd)&lt;/span&gt; against Wellington's left wing. They faced 6,000&amp;nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st “Van Bijlandt” brigade ([[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bijlandt]]) of the 2nd Dutch division. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade, posted towards the centre of the battlefield, had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope. The rest of the brigade was lying down just behind the road, where they were ordered to earlier that day at 09:00 hours (they camped the previous night on the forward slope).&lt;ref&gt;Websites of current Dutch Historians: Erwin van Muilwijk: [http://home.tiscali.nl/erwinmuilwijk/index.htm Tiscali.nl], and Marco Bijl: [http://www.8militia.net 8militia.net] These historians are preparing new publications about the role of the Dutch army.

As these skirmishers were retreating through the British skirmish lines they were booed by some British troops, thinking they were leaving the field. At the moment these skirmishers were joining their parent battalions the brigade was ordered to its feet and started to return fire. Their fire was “little and not well maintained”.&lt;ref&gt;See above: de Bas, and Boulger).{{Full|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battalion had no reserves and was unable to close the gap. D’Erlon’s troops pushed through this gap in the line and the remaining battalions in the Van Bijlandt brigade (8th Dutch militia and Dutch 7th Line Battalion (which was manned by Belgian soldiers)) were forced to retreat to the square of the 5th Dutch militia, which was in reserve between Picton’s troops, about 100 paces to the rear. There they regrouped under the Command of Colonel Van Zuylen van Nijevelt and general Constant-de-Rebeque. A moment later the Prince of Orange ordered a counterattack, which actually occurred around 10 minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;Pawly, Ronald. Wellington’s Belgian Allies.

In the mean time, d'Erlon's men began to ascend the slope, and as they did so, Picton's men stood up and opened fire. The French infantry returned fire and successfully pressured the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre,

the line in front of d'Erlon's left started to crumble. Picton was killed after ordering the counterattack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.

{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything. They never consider the situation, never think of manoeuvring before an enemy, and never keep back or provide a reserve.|Wellington|&lt;ref name=&quot;WellingtonCavalry&quot; /&gt;}}

At this crucial juncture, Uxbridge ordered his two brigades of British heavy cavalry, formed unseen behind the ridge, to charge in support of the hard-pressed infantry. The 1st Brigade, known as the Household Brigade, commanded by Major-General [[Lord Edward Somerset]], consisted of guards regiments: the [[1st Regiment of Life Guards|1st]] and [[2nd Regiment of Life Guards|2nd Life Guards]], the [[Royal Horse Guards]] (the Blues), and the [[1st King's Dragoon Guards|1st (King's) Dragoon Guards]]. The 2nd Brigade, also known as the Union Brigade, commanded by Major-General Sir [[William Ponsonby (general)|William Ponsonby]], was so called as it consisted of an English, the [[1st The Royal Dragoons|1st (The Royals)]]; a Scottish, [[Royal Scots Greys|2nd ('Scots Greys')]]; and an Irish, [[6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons|6th (Inniskilling)]]; regiment of heavy dragoons. More than 20&amp;nbsp;years of warfare had eroded the numbers of suitable cavalry mounts available on the European continent; this resulted in the British heavy cavalry entering the 1815 campaign with the finest horses of any contemporary cavalry arm. They also received excellent mounted swordsmanship training. They were, however, inferior to the French in manoeuvring in large formations, cavalier in attitude, and unlike the infantry had scant experience of warfare. According to Wellington, they had little tactical ability or common sense.&lt;ref name=&quot;WellingtonCavalry&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp= 85–187}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The two brigades had a combined field strength of about 2,000 (2,651 official strength); they charged with the 47-year-old Uxbridge leading them and a very inadequate number of squadrons held in reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=188}}. The Royal Horse Guards (2 squadrons) were in reserve for the Household Brigade (9 or 10 squadrons strong) but the Union Brigade (9 squadrons) had no reserve. Siborne HT, Letter 5, and Glover, Letter 16. The total may have been 18&amp;nbsp;squadrons as there is an uncertainty in the sources as to whether the King's Dragoon Guards fielded three or four squadrons. Uxbridge implies 4 squadrons in Letter 5 in H T Siborne, however, Capt. Naylor of the King's implies 3 when he states he commanded the centre squadron of the regiment, reported in Letter 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is evidence that Uxbridge gave an order, the morning of the battle, to all cavalry brigade commanders to commit their commands on their own initiative, as direct orders from himself might not always be forthcoming, and to &quot;support movements to their front&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, Letter 16, Frederick Stovin (ADC to Sir Thomas Picton)&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that Uxbridge expected the brigades of Vandeleur, Vivian and the Dutch cavalry to provide support to the British heavies. Uxbridge later regretted leading the charge in person, saying &quot;I committed a great mistake,&quot; when he should have been organising an adequate reserve to move forward in support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1993|loc=Letter 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knötel IV, 04.jpg|left|thumb|British Household Cavalry charging]]
The Household Brigade crossed the crest of the Allied position and charged downhill. The [[cuirassiers]] guarding d'Erlon's left flank were still dispersed, and so were swept over the deeply sunken main road and then routed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=426}}, note 18&lt;br /&gt;An episode famously used later by [[Victor Hugo]] in ''[[Les Miserables]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The sunken lane acted as a trap which funnelled the flight of the French cavalry to their own right, away from the British cavalry. Some of the cuirassiers then found themselves hemmed in by the steep sides of the sunken lane, with a confused mass of their own infantry in front of them, the 95th Rifles firing at them from the north side of the lane, and Somerset's heavy cavalry still pressing them from behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|pp=410,411}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The novelty of fighting armoured foes impressed the British cavalrymen, as was recorded by the commander of the Household Brigade.

{{quote|The blows of the sabres on the cuirasses sounded like braziers at work.&quot; |Lord Edward Somerset|&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Houssaye|1900|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Continuing their attack, the squadrons on the left of the Household Brigade then destroyed Aulard's brigade. Despite attempts to recall them, however, they continued past La Haye Sainte and found themselves at the bottom of the hill on blown horses facing Schmitz's brigade formed in [[infantry square|squares]].

[[Image:Ewart Waterloo.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Ewart|Sergeant Ewart]] of the Scots Greys capturing the eagle of the 45''eme Ligne'' by [[Richard Ansdell]]]]
To their left, the Union Brigade suddenly swept through the infantry lines (giving rise to the legend that some of the [[92nd (Gordon Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|92nd Gordon Highland Regiment]] clung onto their stirrups and accompanied them into the charge).&lt;ref&gt;This anecdote can be found in ''The Waterloo Papers'' by E. Bruce Low contained in ''With Napoleon at Waterloo,'' MacBride, M., (editor), London 1911. The tale was related, in old age, by a Sgt-Major Dickinson of the Greys, reputedly the last survivor of the charge.&lt;/ref&gt; From the centre leftwards, the Royal Dragoons destroyed Bourgeois' brigade, capturing the eagle of the 105th ''Ligne''. The Inniskillings routed the other brigade of Quoit's division, and the Greys destroyed most of Nogue's brigade, capturing the eagle of the 45th Ligne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=198–204}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On Wellington's extreme left, Durutte's division had time to form squares and fend off groups of Greys.

As with the Household Cavalry, the officers of the Royals and Inniskillings found it very difficult to rein back their troops, who lost all cohesion. [[James Inglis (Anderson) Hamilton|James Hamilton]], commander of the Greys (who were supposed to form a reserve) ordered a continuation of the charge to the French ''grande batterie''. Though the Greys had neither the time nor means to disable the cannon or carry them off, they put very many out of action as the gun crews fled the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=211}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon promptly responded by ordering a counter-attack by the cuirassier brigades of Farine and Travers and Jaquinot's two lancer regiments in the I Corps [[light cavalry]] division. The result was very heavy losses for the British cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|pp=425–426}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All figures quoted for the losses of the cavalry brigades as a result of this charge are estimates, as casualties were only noted down after the day of the battle and were for the battle as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adkin|2001|p=217}} (for initial strengths)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1998|p=544}} (for losses)&lt;br /&gt; Losses are ultimately from the official returns taken the day after the battle: Household Brigade, initial strength 1,319, killed&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;95, wounded&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;248, missing&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;250, totals&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;593, horses lost&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;672.
Union Brigade, initial strength 1,332, killed&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;264, wounded&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;310, missing&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;38, totals&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;612, horses lost&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;631.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians believe the official rolls tend to overestimate the number of cavalrymen present in their squadrons on the field of battle and that the proportionate losses were, as a result, considerably higher than the numbers on paper might suggest.&lt;ref&gt;This view appears to have arisen from a comment by Captain Clark-Kennedy of the 1st Dragoons 'Royals', in a letter in [[H. T. Siborne]]'s book, he makes an estimate of around 900&amp;nbsp;men actually in line within the Union Brigade before its first charge. He does not, however, explain how his estimate was arrived at. The shortfall of 432&amp;nbsp;men (the equivalent of a whole regiment) from the paper strength of the brigade is large. By comparison the 15th Hussars, at approximately the same paper strength as each of the Union Brigade regiments, had about 60&amp;nbsp;men detached or in the rear at the start of the battle ([[Gareth Glover|Glover, Gareth]]. ''From Corunna to Waterloo: the Letters and Journals of Two Napoleonic Hussars, 1801–1816.'' London: Greenhill Books, 2007). By extrapolation a figure of around 180&amp;nbsp;men, rather than more than 400, from the brigade could be expected to be detached.&lt;/ref&gt; The Union Brigade lost heavily in both officers and men killed (including its commander, William Ponsonby, and Colonel Hamilton of the Scots Greys) and wounded. The 2nd Life Guards and the King's Dragoon Guards of the Household Brigade also lost heavily (with Colonel Fuller, commander of the King's DG, killed). However, the 1st Life Guards, on the extreme right of the charge, and the Blues, who formed a reserve, had kept their cohesion and consequently suffered significantly fewer casualties. A counter-charge, by British and Dutch light dragoons and [[hussar]]s on the left wing and Dutch ''[[carabinier]]s'' in the centre, repelled the French cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=219–223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|pp=329,349}} (composition of brigades), pp. 422–424 (actions of brigades)&lt;br /&gt;Note: [[William Siborne]] was in possession of a number of eyewitness accounts from generals, such as Uxbridge, down to cavalry cornets and infantry ensigns. This makes his history particularly useful (though only from the British and KGL perspective); some of these eyewitness letters were later published by his son, a British Major General (H.T. Siborne)). Parts of Siborne's account was, and is, highly controversial. The very negative light shed on the conduct of the Dutch troops during the battle by Siborne prompted a semi-official rebuttal by Dutch historian captain [[Willem Jan Knoop]] in his ''&quot;Beschouwingen over Siborne's Geschiedenis van den oorlog van 1815 in Frankrijk en de Nederlanden&quot; en wederlegging van de in dat werk voorkomende beschuldigingen tegen het Nederlandsche leger''. Breda 1846; 2nd printing 1847. Knoop based his rebuttal on the official Dutch after-battle reports, drawn up within days of the battle, not on twenty-year-old recollections of veterans, like Siborne. Interestingly, some of the Dutch reports (like that of Col. Van Zuylen van Nyevelt, the chief-of-staff of the Dutch 2nd division) seem to have been available to Siborne, but he chose not to use them.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many popular histories suggest that the British heavy cavalry were destroyed as a viable force following their first, epic charge. Examination of eyewitness accounts reveal, however, that far from being ineffective, they continued to provide very valuable services. They counter-charged French cavalry numerous times (both brigades),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1993|loc=Letters: 18, 26, 104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; halted a combined cavalry and infantry attack (Household Brigade only),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1993|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|p=463}}.&lt;/ref&gt; were used to bolster the morale of those units in their vicinity at times of crisis, and filled gaps in the Anglo-Allied line caused by high casualties in infantry formations (both brigades).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1993|loc=Letters 9, 18, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; This service was rendered at a very high cost, as close combat with French cavalry, carbine fire, infantry musketry and – more deadly than all of these – artillery fire steadily eroded the number of effectives&lt;ref&gt;In a cavalry unit an &quot;effective&quot; was an unwounded trooper mounted on a sound horse. The military term &quot;effective&quot; describes a soldier, piece of equipment (e.g. a tank or aircraft) or military unit capable of fighting or carrying out its intended purpose.&lt;/ref&gt; in the two brigades. At the end of the fighting the two brigades, by this time combined, could muster only a few composite squadrons.

Some 20,000 French troops had been committed to this attack. Its failure cost Napoleon not only heavy casualties – 3,000&amp;nbsp;prisoners were taken – but valuable time, as the Prussians now began to appear on the field to his right. Napoleon sent his reserve, Lobau's VI corps and two cavalry divisions, some 15,000&amp;nbsp;troops, to hold them back. With this, Napoleon had committed all of his infantry reserves, except the Guard, and he now had to beat Wellington not only quickly, but with inferior numbers.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-122/&gt;

===The French cavalry attack===
A little before 16:00, Ney noted an apparent exodus from Wellington's centre. He mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat, and sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with cavalry alone.&lt;ref name=Siborne439&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|p=439}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially [[Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud|Milhaud's]] reserve cavalry corps of cuirassiers and [[Charles, comte Lefebvre-Desnouettes|Lefebvre-Desnoëttes']] light cavalry division of the Imperial Guard, some 4,800&amp;nbsp;sabres, were committed. When these were repulsed, [[François Étienne de Kellermann|Kellermann's]] heavy cavalry corps and [[Claude-Étienne Guyot|Guyot's]] heavy cavalry of the Guard were added to the massed assault, a total of around 9,000&amp;nbsp;cavalry in 67&amp;nbsp;squadrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adkin|2001|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:French cuirassiers vs Nassauers.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|&quot;French [[Cuirassier]]s&quot;, by Louis Dumoulin.]]
Wellington's army responded by forming [[infantry square|squares]] (hollow box-formations four ranks deep). Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle – a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than 60&amp;nbsp;feet (18&amp;nbsp;m) in length on a side. Vulnerable to artillery or infantry, squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, because they could not be outflanked and because horses would not charge into a hedge of bayonets. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.

Witnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12&amp;nbsp;assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer. Kellermann, recognising the futility of the attacks, tried to reserve the elite ''[[Carabiniers-à-Cheval|carabinier]]'' brigade from joining in, but eventually Ney spotted them and insisted on their involvement.&lt;ref name=Adkin359&gt;{{Harvnb|Adkin|2001|p=359}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A British eyewitness of the first French cavalry attack, an officer in the Foot Guards, recorded his impressions very lucidly and somewhat poetically:
 

{{quote|About four P.M. the enemy's artillery in front of us ceased firing all of a sudden, and we saw large masses of cavalry advance: not a man present who survived could have forgotten in after life the awful grandeur of that charge. You discovered at a distance what appeared to be an overwhelming, long moving line, which, ever advancing, glittered like a stormy wave of the sea when it catches the sunlight. On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''&quot;Vive l'Empereur!&quot;'' The word of command, &quot;Prepare to receive cavalry&quot;, had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards|&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gronow|1862|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Image:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|200px|&quot;The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses.&quot; (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]
In essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weller|1992|pp=211,212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adkin|2001|pp=252,361}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive counter-charges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavalié Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded 'G' Troop, [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky&lt;ref&gt;This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part. Wellington himself sought refuge in the &quot;shaky&quot; Brunswick squares at the time and observed what he interpreted as acts of cowardice by British artillerymen, who &quot;...ran off the field entirely, taking with them limbers, ammunition, and everything...&quot; as he wrote in a letter of 21 December 1815 to the Master-General of the Ordnance, Lord Mulgrave. The incident even justified the denial of pensions to members of the Artillery Corps in his view. So, where Mercer claimed heroism, Wellington saw the opposite. See for the full text of Wellington's letter, and an attempted rebuttal {{aut|Duncan, F.}} (1879) ''History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery'', Appendix A, pp. 444-464 [http://books.google.com/books?id=8qDrGClIogsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Wellington+captain+Sandham+Mulgrave&amp;lr=#PPA444,M1 Google Books.] The letter was originally published in ''WSD'', vol. XIV (1858 ed.), pp. 618-620&lt;/ref&gt; that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect:

{{quote|I thus allowed them to advance unmolested until the head of the column might have been about fifty or sixty yards from us, and then gave the word, &quot;Fire!&quot; The effect was terrible. Nearly the whole leading rank fell at once; and the round shot, penetrating the column carried confusion throughout its extent&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;the discharge of every gun was followed by a fall of men and horses like that of grass before the mower's scythe. |[[Cavalié Mercer|Captain Cavalié Mercer]], RHA|&lt;ref name=&quot;M70&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mercer|1870|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Charge of the French Cuirassiers at Waterloo.jpg|right|thumb|280px|A British square puts up dogged resistance against attacking French cavalry.]]
For reasons that remain unclear, no attempt was made to [[Touch hole|spike]] other allied guns while they were in French possession. In line with Wellington's orders, gunners were able to return to their pieces and fire into the French cavalry as they withdrew after each attack. After numerous costly but fruitless attacks on the Mont-Saint-Jean ridge, the French cavalry was spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weller|1992|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their casualties cannot easily be estimated. Senior French cavalry officers, in particular the generals, experienced heavy losses. Four divisional commanders were wounded, nine brigadiers wounded, and one killed – testament to their courage and their habit of leading from the front.&lt;ref name=Adkin359/&gt; Illustratively, Houssaye reports that the ''Grenadiers à Cheval'' numbered 796 of all ranks on 15 June, but just 462 on 19 June, while the Empress Dragoons lost 416 of 816 over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Houssaye|1900|p=522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall Guyot's Guard heavy cavalry division lost 47&amp;nbsp;percent of its strength.

[[Image:Waterloo-French cavalry.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The ''Grenadiers à Cheval''. Napoleon can be seen in the background on a grey horse.&lt;ref&gt;A number of different mounts could have been ridden by Napoleon at Waterloo: Ali, Crebère, Désirée, Jaffa, Marie and Tauris ({{Harvnb|Summerville|2007|loc=[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q_cXSrh0C_IC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=horse+D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9e+waterloo#PPA315,M1 p. 315]}}) Lozier states it was Désirée (Lozier).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Eventually it became obvious, even to Ney, that cavalry alone were achieving little. Belatedly, he organised a combined-arms attack, using Bachelu's division and Tissot's regiment of Foy's division from Reille's II Corps (about 6,500&amp;nbsp;infantrymen) plus those French cavalry that remained in a fit state to fight. This assault was directed along much the same route as the previous heavy cavalry attacks.&lt;ref name=Adkin361&gt;{{Harvnb|Adkin|2001|p=361}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was halted by a charge of the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge. The British cavalry were unable, however, to break the French infantry, and fell back with losses from musketry fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1993|pp=14,38–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Uxbridge recorded that he tried to lead the Dutch Carabiniers, under Major-General [[Albert Dominicus Trip van Zoudtlandt|Trip]], to renew the attack and that they refused to follow him. Other members of the British cavalry staff also commented on this occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1993|loc=pp.14–15 and letters 6,7 and 9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no support for this incident in Dutch or Belgian sources,&lt;ref&gt;On the contrary, many contradicted this British account vehemently. See e.g. {{aut|[[Alexis-Michel Eenens|Eenens, A.M]]}} (1879) &quot;Dissertation sur la participation des troupes des Pays-Bas a la campagne de 1815 en Belgique&quot;, in: Societé royale des beaux arts et de litérature de Gand, ''Messager des Sciences Historiques'', pp. 131-198.

The Anglo-allied cavalry, except for Sir John Vandeleur's and Sir Hussey Vivian's brigades on the far left, had all been committed to the fight, and had taken significant losses. The situation appeared so desperate that the Cumberland Hussars, the only Hanoverian cavalry regiment present, fled the field spreading alarm all the way to Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|p=465}}&lt;br /&gt;The commander of this regiment, who was later court-martialled and cashiered, claimed that as his troopers (all well-to-do young Hanoverians) owned their own horses he could not order them to remain on the field. Following the battle the regiment was broken up and the troopers assigned duties they, no-doubt, considered ignominious. Four were posted to Captain Mercer's horse artillery troop, where he found them &quot;amazingly snappish and sulky with everyone&quot; (see:{{Harvnb|Mercer|1870|loc=}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knotel - The storming of La Haye Sainte.jpg|right|thumb|230px|alt=The storming of La Haye Sainte by Knötel|The storming of La Haye Sainte by Knötel]]
At approximately the same time as Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, rallied elements of D'Erlon's I Corps, spearheaded by the 13th ''Légère,'' renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte, and this time were successful (partly because the defenders' ammunition ran out).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beamish|1995|p=367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ney then moved [[horse artillery]] up towards Wellington's centre and began to pulverise the infantry squares at short-range with [[canister shot|canister]].&lt;ref name=Siborne439/&gt; This all but destroyed the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment, and the 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square.

===Arrival of the Prussian IV Corps: Plancenoit===
[[Image:Prussian Attack Plancenoit by Adolf Northern.jpg|thumb|200px|The Prussian attack on [[Plancenoit]] painted by [[Adolph Northern]]]]
The first Prussian corps to arrive was Bülow's IV Corps. His objective was Plancenoit, which the Prussians intended to use as a springboard into the rear of the French positions. Blücher intended to secure his right upon Frichermont using the Bois de Paris road.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-116&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blücher and Wellington had been exchanging communications since 10:00 and had agreed to this advance on Frichermont if Wellington's centre was under attack.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-95&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chesney|1907|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Bülow noted that the way to Plancenoit lay open and that the time was 16:30.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-116/&gt; At about this time, as the French cavalry attack was in full spate, the 15th Brigade IV Corps was sent to link up with the Nassauers of Wellington's left flank in the Frichermont–La Haie area with the brigade's horse artillery battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to its left in support.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-117&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon sent Lobau's corps to intercept the rest of Bülow's IV Corps proceeding to Plancenoit. The 15th Brigade threw Lobau's troops out of Frichermont with a determined bayonet charge, then proceeded up the Frichermont heights, battering French Chasseurs with 12-pounder artillery fire, and pushed on to Plancenoit. This sent Lobau's corps into retreat to the Plancenoit area, and in effect drove Lobau past the rear of the ''Armee Du Nord's'' right flank and directly threatened its only line of retreat. Hiller's 16th Brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against Plancenoit. Napoleon had dispatched all eight battalions of the Young Guard to reinforce Lobau, who was now seriously pressed. The Young Guard counter-attacked and, after very hard fighting, secured Plancenoit, but were themselves counter-attacked and driven out.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-122&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon sent two battalions of the Middle/Old Guard into Plancenoit and after ferocious bayonet fighting—they did not deign to fire their muskets—this force recaptured the village.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-122/&gt; The dogged Prussians were still not beaten, and approximately 30,000&amp;nbsp;troops of IV and II Corps, under Bülow and Pirch, attacked Plancenoit again. It was defended by 20,000&amp;nbsp;Frenchmen {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}in and around the village.

===Zieten's flank march===
[[Image:Battle of Waterloo map.jpg|thumb|300px|Situation from 17:30 to 20:00]]
Throughout the late afternoon, Zieten's I Corps had been arriving in greater strength in the area just north of La Haie. General Müffling, Prussian liaison to Wellington, rode to meet I Corps. Zieten had by this time brought up his 1st Brigade, but had become concerned at the sight of stragglers and casualties, from the Nassau units on Wellington's left and from the Prussian 15th Brigade. These troops appeared to be withdrawing, and Zieten, fearing that his own troops would be caught up in a general retreat, was starting to move away from Wellington's flank and towards the Prussian main body near Plancenoit. Müffling saw this movement away and persuaded Zieten to support Wellington's left flank. Zieten resumed his march to support Wellington directly, and the arrival of his troops allowed Wellington to reinforce his crumbling centre by moving cavalry from his left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; I Corps proceeded to attack the French troops before Papelotte and by 19:30, the French position was bent into a rough horseshoe shape. The ends of the line were now based on Hougoumont on the left, Plancenoit on the right, and the centre on La Haie.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-139&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durutte had taken the positions of La Haie and Papelotte in a series of attacks,&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-139/&gt; but now retreated behind Smohain without opposing the Prussian 24th Regiment as it retook both. The 24th advanced against the new French position, was repulsed, and returned to the attack supported by Silesian ''Schützen'' (riflemen) and the F/1st ''Landwehr''.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-140&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French initially fell back before the renewed assault, but now began seriously to contest ground, attempting to regain Smohain and hold on to the ridgeline and the last few houses of Papelotte.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-140/&gt; The 24th Regiment linked up with a Highlander battalion on its far right and along with the 13th ''Landwehr'' regiment and cavalry support threw the French out of these positions. Further attacks by the 13th ''Landwehr'' and the 15th Brigade drove the French from Frichermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Durutte's division, finding itself about to be charged by massed squadrons of Zieten's I Corps cavalry reserve, retreated from the battlefield. I Corps then advanced to the Brussels road and the only line of retreat available to the French.

===Attack of the Imperial Guard===
[[File:Knotel - The storming of La Haye Sainte.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Richard Knötel]], &quot;The storming of La Haye Sainte&quot;.]]
Meanwhile, with Wellington's centre exposed by the fall of La Haye Sainte, and the Plancenoit front temporarily stabilised, Napoleon committed his last reserve, the hitherto-undefeated Imperial Guard. This attack, mounted at around 19:30, was intended to break through Wellington's centre and roll up his line away from the Prussians. Although it is one of the most celebrated passages of arms in military history, it is unclear which units actually participated. It appears that it was mounted by five battalions&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|loc=}} {{Page needed|date=May 2010}} notes that two Chasseur battalions were merged into one on the day of the battle, so while five Guard formations went forward, they may have comprised six battalions.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Middle Guard, and not by the Grenadiers or Chasseurs of the Old Guard.

{{quote|... I saw four regiments of the middle guard, conducted by the Emperor, arriving. With these troops, he wished to renew the attack, and penetrate the centre of the enemy. He ordered me to lead them on; generals, officers and soldiers all displayed the greatest intrepidity; but this body of troops was too weak to resist, for a long time, the forces opposed to it by the enemy, and it was soon necessary to renounce the hope which this attack had, for a few moments, inspired. |Marshal M. Ney|&lt;ref name=Booth-73-74&gt;{{Harvnb|Booth|1815|pp=73,74}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Soldat-der-Alten-Garde.png|thumb|140px|left|[[Grenadier]] of the [[Old Guard]], by [[Edouard Detaille]]]]
[[File:Crofts-Napoleon's last grand attack at Waterloo.jpg|thumb|250px|Napoleon addresses the [[Old Guard]] as it prepares to attack the Anglo-Allied center at Waterloo.]]
Three Old Guard battalions did move forward and formed the attack's second line, though they remained in reserve and did not directly assault the Anglo-allied line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adkin|2001|p=391}}.&lt;br /&gt;The attacking battalions were 1st/3rd and 4th Grenadiers and 1st/3rd, 2nd/3rd and 4th Chasseurs of the Middle Guard; those remaining in reserve were the 2nd/2nd Grenadiers, 2nd/1st and 2nd/2nd Chasseurs of the Old Guard.&lt;/ref&gt; Marching through a hail of canister and skirmisher fire, the 3,000 or so Middle Guardsmen advanced to the west of La Haye Sainte, and in so doing, separated into three distinct attack forces. One, consisting of two battalions of Grenadiers, defeated Wellington's first line of British, Brunswick and Nassau troops and marched on. [[David Hendrik Chassé|Chassé]]'s relatively fresh Dutch division was sent against them and Allied artillery fired into the victorious Grenadiers' flank. This still could not stop the Guard's advance, so Chassé ordered his first brigade to charge the outnumbered French, who faltered and broke.&lt;ref name=Chesney-178&gt;{{Harvnb|Chesney|1907|pp=178,179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the west, 1,500 British Foot Guards under [[Peregrine Maitland|Maitland]] were lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery. As two battalions of Chasseurs approached, the second prong of the Imperial Guard's attack, Maitland's guardsmen rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys. The Chasseurs deployed to answer the fire, but began to waver. A bayonet charge by the Foot Guards then broke them. The third prong, a fresh Chasseur battalion, now came up in support. The British guardsmen retired with these Chasseurs in pursuit, but the latter were halted as the [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd Light Infantry]] wheeled in line onto their flank and poured a devastating fire into them and then charged.&lt;ref name=Chesney-178/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parry-70&gt;{{Harvnb|Parry|1900|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this onslaught they too broke.&lt;ref name=Parry-70/&gt;

The last of the Guard retreated headlong. A ripple of panic passed through the French lines as the astounding news spread: &quot;''La Garde recule. Sauve qui peut''!&quot; (&quot;The Guard retreats. Save yourself if you can!&quot;). Wellington now stood up in [[Wellington Statue Aldershot|Copenhagen]]'s stirrups, and waved his hat in the air to signal a general advance. His army rushed forward from the lines and threw themselves upon the retreating French.&lt;ref name=Chesney-178/&gt;

The surviving Imperial Guard rallied on their three reserve battalions (some sources say four) just south of La Haye Sainte, for a [[last stand]]. A charge from [[Frederick Adam|Adam's]] Brigade and the Hanoverian ''Landwehr'' Osnabrück Battalion, plus Vivian's and Vandeleur's relatively fresh cavalry brigades to their right, threw them into confusion. Those left in semi-cohesive units retreated towards ''La Belle Alliance''. It was during this retreat that some of the Guards were invited to surrender, eliciting the famous, if apocryphal,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'The Guard dies, but it does not surrender!' is another of these fictitious historical sayings. General Cambronne, to whom it is attributed, never uttered. Victor Hugo, in Les Miserables, has restored the true text. It is composed of a single word [''Merde!'']&quot; (David Masson, ''et al''. ''Macmillan's magazine'', Volume 19, Macmillan and Co., 1869, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xt76rS3-RbwC&amp;q=fictitious+The+Guard+dies,+it+does+not+surrender&amp;dq=fictitious+The+Guard+dies,+it+does+not+surrender p. 164])&lt;/ref&gt; retort &quot;''La Garde meurt, elle ne se rend pas!''&quot; (&quot;The Guard dies, it does not surrender!&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;White&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The reply is commonly attributed to General [[Pierre Cambronne]] originating from an attribution by the journalist Balison de Rougemont in ''Journal General'' published on 24 June 1815 (Shapiro (2006) [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w5-GR-qtgXsC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Rougemont+Waterloo p. 128]), although Cambronne clamed he replied &quot;''Merde!''&quot; (Boller [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NCOEYJ0q-DUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA12,M1 p. 12]). However according to letters in ''[[The Times]]'' in June 1932, Cambronne was already a prisoner of Colonel [[Hugh Halkett]], so the retort, if ever given, or in whatever form it took, may have come from [[Claude-Etienne Michel|General Michel]] instead.

At about the same time, the Prussian 5th, 14th, and 16th Brigades were starting to push through Plancenoit, in the third assault of the day.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-144/&gt; The church was by now on fire, while its graveyard—the French centre of resistance—had corpses strewn about &quot;as if by a whirlwind&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-144&gt;Hofschröer, pp. 144,145 {{Verify source|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five Guard battalions were deployed in support of the Young Guard, virtually all of which was now committed to the defence, along with remnants of Lobau's corps.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-144/&gt; The key to the Plancenoit position proved to be the Chantelet woods to the south. Pirch's II Corps had arrived with two brigades and reinforced the attack of IV Corps, advancing through the woods. The 25th Regiment's musketeer battalions threw the 1/2e Grenadiers (Old Guard) out of the Chantelet woods, outflanking Plancenoit and forcing a retreat. The Old Guard retreated in good order until they met the mass of troops retreating in panic, and became part of that rout.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-144/&gt; The Prussian IV Corps advanced beyond Plancenoit to find masses of French retreating from British pursuit in disorder.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-144/&gt; The Prussians were unable to fire for fear of hitting Anglo-allied units. This was the fifth and final time that Plancenoit changed hands. French forces not retreating with the Guard were surrounded in their positions and eliminated, neither side asking for nor offering quarter. The French Young Guard Division reported 96&amp;nbsp;percent casualties, and two-thirds of Lobau's Corps ceased to exist.
{{quote|Despite their great courage and stamina, the French Guards fighting in the village began to show signs of wavering. The church was already on fire with columns of red flame coming out of the windows, aisles and doors. In the village itself, still the scene of bitter house-to-house fighting, everything was burning, adding to the confusion. However, once Major von Witzleben's manoeuver was accomplished and the French Guards saw their flank and rear threatened, they began to withdraw. The Guard Chasseurs under General Pelet formed the rearguard. The remnants of the Guard left in a great rush, leaving large masses of artillery, equipment and ammunition wagons in the wake of their retreat. The evacuation of Plancenoit led to the loss of the position that was to be used to cover the withdrawal of the French Army to Charleroi. The Guard fell back from Plancenoit in the direction of Maison du Roi and Caillou. Unlike other parts of the battlefield, there were no cries of &quot;Sauve qui peut!&quot; here. Instead the cry &quot;Sauvons nos aigles!&quot; (&quot;Let's save our eagles!&quot;) could be heard.|Official History of the 25th Regiment, 4 Corps|&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Disintegration===

The French right, left, and centre had all now failed.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-144/&gt; The last cohesive French force consisted of two battalions of the Old Guard stationed around ''La Belle Alliance'', the final reserve and personal bodyguard for Napoleon. Napoleon hoped to rally the French army behind them&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid&lt;/ref&gt; but as retreat turned into rout, they too were forced to withdraw, one on either side of ''La Belle Alliance'', in square as protection against Coalition cavalry. Until persuaded that the battle was lost and he should leave, Napoleon commanded the square to the left of the inn.&lt;ref name=Creasy-XV/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Comte d'Erlon|1815|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam's Brigade charged and forced back this square,&lt;ref name=Parry-70/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-149&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Prussians engaged the other. As dusk fell, both squares withdrew in relatively good order, but the French artillery and everything else fell into the hands of the allies. The retreating Guards were surrounded by thousands of fleeing, broken French troops. Coalition cavalry harried the fugitives until about 23:00, with Gneisenau pursuing them as far as Genappe before ordering a halt. There, Napoleon's abandoned carriage was captured, still containing diamonds left in the rush. These became part of King Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia's crown jewels; one Major Keller of the F/15th received the [[Pour le Mérite]] with oak leaves for the feat.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-151&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time 78&amp;nbsp;guns and 2,000&amp;nbsp;prisoners had also been taken, including more generals.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-150&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There remained to us still four squares of the Old Guard to protect the retreat. These brave grenadiers, the choice of the army, forced successively to retire, yielded ground foot by foot, till, overwhelmed by numbers, they were almost entirely annihilated.

It was there that Napoleon was during the battle; it was thence that he gave his orders, that he flattered himself with the hopes of victory; and it was there that his ruin was decided.

[[Image:Morgen nach der Schlacht967b.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;The morning after the battle of Waterloo&quot;, by [[John Heaviside Clarke]], 1816.]]
Historian [[Peter Hofschröer]] has written that Wellington and Blücher met at Genappe around 22:00 signifying the end of the battle.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-151/&gt; Other sources have recorded that the meeting took place around 21:00 near Napoleon's former headquarters at ''La Belle Alliance''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.army.mod.uk/infantry/regts/the_rifles/history_traditions/ Regimental history of the Rifles]: [http://www2.army.mod.uk/infantry/regts/the_rifles/history_traditions/origins_campaigns/the_battle_of_waterloo.htm Battle of Waterloo] on an old website of the [[British Ministry of Defence]]. See the link near the bottom called [http://www2.army.mod.uk/linkedfiles/lightinfantry/regimental_downloads/the_battle_of_waterloo.ppt &quot;here&quot; (ppt)] Slide 39&lt;/ref&gt; Waterloo cost Wellington around 15,000 dead or wounded, and Blücher some 7,000 (810 of which were suffered by just one unit, the 18th Regiment, which served in Bulow's 15th Brigade, fought at both Fichermont and Plancenoit, and won 33&amp;nbsp;[[Iron Cross]]es).&lt;ref&gt;''Prussian Reserve Infantry 1813–1815'', Robert Mantle, Napoleonic Association, 1977 [http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_resinf2.html Napolean-series.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon lost 25,000 dead or wounded, with 8,000 taken prisoner.

{{quote|June&amp;nbsp;22. This morning I went to visit the field of battle, which is a little beyond the village of Waterloo, on the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean; but on arrival there the sight was too horrible to behold. I felt sick in the stomach and was obliged to return. The multitude of carcasses, the heaps of wounded men with mangled limbs unable to move, and perishing from not having their wounds dressed or from hunger, as the Allies were, of course, obliged to take their surgeons and waggons with them, formed a spectacle I shall never forget. The wounded, both of the Allies and the French, remain in an equally deplorable state.|Major W.

At 10:30 on 19 June General Grouchy, still following his orders, defeated General Thielemann at [[Battle of Wavre|Wavre]] and withdrew in good order though at the cost of 33,000 French troops that never reached the Waterloo battlefield. Wellington sent his official despatch describing the battle to England on 19 June 1815, and it arrived in London on 21 June 1815 and was published as a [[London Gazette|''London Gazette Extraordinary'']] on 22 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17028|startpage=1213|date=22 June 1815|accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington, Blücher and other Coalition forces advanced upon Paris. Napoleon announced his second abdication on 24 June 1815. In the final skirmish of the Napoleonic Wars, Marshal [[Davout]], Napoleon's minister of war, was defeated by Blücher at [[Battle of Issy|Issy]] on 3 July 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Wood-NuttallEncyclopaedia/i/issy.html Nuttal Encyclopaedia: Issy]&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, Napoleon tried to escape to North America, but the [[Royal Navy]] was blockading French ports to forestall such a move. He finally surrendered to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Frederick Lewis Maitland (Rear Admiral)|Frederick Maitland]] of [[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]] [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|''Bellerophon'']] on 15 July. There was a campaign against French fortresses that still held out; [[Longwy]] capitulated on 13 September 1815, the last to do so. The [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed on 20 November 1815. [[Louis XVIII]] was restored to the throne of France, and Napoleon was exiled to [[Saint Helena]], where he died in 1821.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-274-276-320&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|pp=274–276,320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Royal Highness, - Exposed to the factions which divide my country, and to the enmity of the great Powers of Europe, I have terminated my political career; and I come, like [[Themistocles]], to throw myself upon the hospitality (''m'asseoir sur le foyer'') of the British people. I claim from your Royal Highness the protections of the laws, and throw myself upon the most powerful, the most constant, and the most generous of my enemies. |Napoleon. (letter of surrender to the Prince Regent; translation)|&lt;ref name=Booth-57&gt;{{Harvnb|Booth|1815|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Wilkie chelseapensioners.jpg|thumb|270px|[[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]], ''The [[Royal Hospital, Chelsea|Chelsea Pensioners]] reading the Waterloo Dispatch'', 1822.]]

Maitland's [[1st Foot Guards]], who had defeated the Chasseurs of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Guard]], were thought to have defeated the Grenadiers; they were awarded the title of [[Grenadier Guards]] in recognition of their feat, and adopted bearskins in the style of the Grenadiers. Britain's Household Cavalry likewise adopted the cuirass in 1821 in recognition of their success against their armoured French counterparts. The effectiveness of the lance was noted by all participants and this weapon subsequently became more widespread throughout Europe; the British converted their first light cavalry regiment to lancers in 1816.

Waterloo was a decisive battle in more than one sense. It definitively ended the series of wars that had convulsed Europe, and involved many other regions of the world, since the French Revolution of the early 1790s. It also ended the political and military career of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], one of the greatest commanders and statesmen in history. Finally, it ushered in almost half a century of international peace in Europe; no further major conflict occurred until the [[Crimean War]].

===A French view of the reasons for Napoleon's defeat===
General Baron [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]], one of the leading military writers on the Napoleonic art of war had a number of very cogent explanations of the reasons behind Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.&lt;ref&gt;Jomini was Swiss by birth, but was an officer, eventually a general, in the French army and had served on the staff of Marshal Ney.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In my opinion, four principal causes led to this disaster:

The first, and most influential, was the arrival, skilfully combined, of Blücher, and the false movement that favored this arrival;&lt;ref&gt;This &quot;false movement&quot; was the detachment of Grouchy's force in pursuit of the Prussians – Napoleon had overestimated the extent of his victory at Ligny and underestimated the resilience of the Prussians. He also seems to have discounted the presence of Bülow's substantial corps, which had not been in action at Ligny. Had Napoleon retained Grouchy's 30,000 men as a guard for his right flank it is likely that these troops could have held off the Prussians and allowed the rest of Napoleon's army to attack Wellington's army unmolested.&lt;/ref&gt; the second, was the admirable firmness of the British infantry, joined to the sang-froid and aplomb of its chiefs; the third, was the horrible weather, that had softened the ground, and rendered the offensive movements so toilsome, and retarded till one o'clock the attack that should have been made in the morning; the fourth, was the inconceivable formation of the first corps, in masses very much too deep for the first grand attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jomini|1864|pp=223,224}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The battlefield today===
[[Image:Waterloo Lion.jpg|thumb|[[Lion's Mound]] at Waterloo, erected on the spot where it is believed the Prince of Orange was wounded]]
[[File:French 6 pounder field gun cast 1813 in Metz captured at Waterloo by the Duke of Wellington.jpg|thumb|French [[Canon de 6 système An XI|6-pounder field gun]], cast in 1813 in [[Metz]], captured at the Battle of Waterloo by the [[Duke of Wellington]], now at the [[Tower of London]].]]
Some portions of the terrain on the battlefield have been altered from their 1815 appearance. Tourism began the day after the battle, with Captain Mercer noting that on 19 June &quot;a carriage drove on the ground from Brussels, the inmates of which, alighting, proceeded to examine the field&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;M70&quot;/&gt; In 1820, the Netherlands' King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] ordered the construction of a monument on the spot where it was believed his son, the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]], had been wounded. The [[Lion's Hillock]], a giant mound, was constructed here, using {{convert|300000|m3|yd3}} of earth taken from the ridge at the centre of the British line which effectively removed the southern bank of Wellington's sunken road.

{{quote|Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place, are no longer what they were on June&amp;nbsp;18, 1815. By taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real relief has been taken away, and history, disconcerted, no longer finds her bearings there. It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later, exclaimed, &quot;They have altered my field of battle!&quot; Where the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe. The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from Genappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other, the German tomb, is on the right. There is no French tomb. The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France. |[[Victor Hugo]], ''[[Les Misérables]]''|&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugo&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hugo|1862|loc=Chapter VII: Napoleon in a Good Humor}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, other terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle. These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels-Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.

Apart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments scattered throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels-Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud-Ohain crossroads mark the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and KGL troops. A monument to the French dead entitled The Wounded Eagle (L'aigle Blessé) marks the location where it is believed one of the French guard units formed square during the closing moments of the battle. A monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of Placenoit on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme|Duhesme]] mausoleum is one among the few graves of Waterloo fallen fighters. It is located at the side of the Saint Martin's church in [[Ways]], a [[Genappe]]'s hamlet. Seventeen Waterloo fallen officers are buried in the crypt of a large grave in the Brussel's cemetery in Evere&lt;ref&gt;C Van Hoorebeeke ''Blackman, John-Lucie : pourquoi sa tombe est-elle à Hougomont?'' Bulletin de l'Association belge napoléonienne, n° 118, septembre - octobre 2007, pages 6 à 21)&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Boomerang.jpg|thumb|300px|A typical wooden returning boomerang]]
A '''boomerang''' is a flying tool with a curved shape used as a weapon or for sport. Although it is usually thought of as a wooden device, modern boomerangs used for sport are often made from [[Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre-reinforced plastics]] or other high-tech materials. Historically, boomerang-like devices have also been made from bones. Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function. The most recognisable type is the returning boomerang, which is a throwing stick that travels in an [[Ellipse|elliptical]] path and returns to its point of origin when thrown correctly. A returning boomerang has two or more wings arranged so that the spinning creates unbalanced forces that curve its path. Although non-returning boomerangs [[Throwing stick|throw sticks]] (or kylies) were used as weapons, returning boomerangs have been used primarily for leisure or recreation. Returning boomerangs were also used as decoy birds of prey, thrown above long grass in order to frighten [[game (food)|game]] birds into flight and into waiting nets. Modern returning boomerangs can be of various shapes or sizes as can be seen in the diagram of modern Boomerangs to the right of page.

Historical evidence also points to the use of non-returning boomerangs by the ancient [[Egyptians]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of [[California]] and [[Arizona]], and inhabitants of southern [[India]] for killing bird
