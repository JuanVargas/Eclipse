Hilly countryside and plains lie to the southeast, along the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast|Black Sea]] coast, and along Bulgaria's main river, the [[Danube]], to the north. [[Strandja|Strandzha]] forms the tallest mountain in the southeast. Few mountains and hills exist in the northeast region of [[Dobrudja|Dobrudzha]].

Bulgaria has large deposits of [[bauxite]], [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[bismuth]] and [[manganese]]. Smaller deposits exist of [[iron]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[uranium]], [[chromite]], [[nickel]], and others. Bulgaria has abundant non-metalliferous minerals such as [[rock-salt]], [[gypsum]], [[kaolin]] and [[marble]].

===Hydrography and climate===

The country has a dense network of about 540 rivers, most of them—with the notable exception of the [[Danube]]—short and with low water-levels.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Donchev |first=D. |title=Geography of Bulgaria |publisher=ciela |location=Sofia |page=68 |language=Bulgarian |isbn=9546497177|year=2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Most rivers flow through mountainous areas. The longest river located solely in Bulgarian territory, the [[Iskar (river)|Iskar]], has a length of {{convert|368|km|0|sp=us}}. Other major rivers include the [[Struma River|Struma]] and the [[Maritsa|Maritsa River]] in the south.

Bulgaria overall has a [[temperate climate]], with cold winters and hot summers. The barrier effect of the [[Balkan Mountains]] has some influence on climate throughout the country–northern Bulgaria experiences lower temperatures and receives more rain than the southern lowlands.

[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] in Bulgaria averages about {{convert|630|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0074) Climate], Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; In the lowlands rainfall varies between {{convert|500|and|800|mm|1|sp=us}}, and in the mountain areas between {{convert|1000|and|2500|mm|1|sp=us}} of rain falls per year. Drier areas include [[Dobrudja]] and the northern coastal strip, while the higher parts of the [[Rila]], [[Pirin]], [[Rhodope Mountains]], [[Stara Planina]], [[Osogovska]] Mountain and [[Vitosha]] receive the highest levels of precipitation.

[[File:Georgi S. Parvanov.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georgi Parvanov]], president and head of state of Bulgaria]]

The National Assembly or ''[[Narodno Sabranie]]'' (Народно събрание) consists of 240 deputies, each elected for four-year terms by popular vote. The National Assembly has the power to enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] and other ministers, declare war, deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements. The [[President of Bulgaria|president]] serves as the [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. While unable to initiate [[legislation]] other than constitutional amendments, the President can return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the President's veto by vote of a majority of all MPs. [[Boyko Borisov]], leader of the centre-right party [[Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria]], became prime minister on 27 July 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/infoCountryPage/setimes/resource_centre/bios/borisov_boyko?country=Bulgaria Boyko Borisov, Prime Minister of Bulgaria], SETimes.com&lt;/ref&gt; and Georgi Parvanov was re-elected as a president in 2005.

===Law===

The Bulgarian legal system recognizes the Acts of Parliament as a main source of law, and is a typical representative of the [[Romano-Germanic law]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Bulgaria.htm The Bulgarian Legal System and Legal Research], Hauser Global Law School Program, August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The judiciary is overseen by the Ministry of Justice, while the Supreme Administrative Court and Supreme Court of Cassation, the highest courts of appeal, rule on the application of laws in lower courts. The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges.

Bulgaria has an industrialized, open [[free market economy|free-market economy]], with a large, moderately advanced private sector and a number of strategic [[state-owned enterprise]]s.
The [[World Bank]] classifies it as an &quot;upper-middle-income economy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Bulgaria has experienced rapid economic growth {{As of|2008|alt= in recent years}}, even though its income level remains one of the lowest within the EU. According to [[Eurostat]] data, Bulgarian PPS GDP per capita stood at 44 per cent of the EU average in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/guip/themeAction.do|title=Bulgaria country profile - economic indicators|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bulgarian lev]] is the country's national currency. The lev is pegged to the [[euro]] at a rate of 1.95583 levs for 1 euro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnb.bg/Statistics/StExternalSector/StExchangeRates/StERFixed/index.htm Fixed currency exchange rates], Bulgarian National Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, GDP (PPP) was estimated at $96.778&amp;nbsp;billion, with a per capita value of $12,851.&lt;ref name=imf2/&gt; The services sector accounts for 63.7% of the GDP, followed by the industry with 30.3% and agriculture with 6%. Major industries include [[iron]], [[copper]], [[bismuth]] and [[coal]] extraction, [[electronics]], [[chemical industry|chemicals]], [[machinery industry|machinery]], [[steel]] and [[refined petroleum fuel]] production, [[vehicle]] components, [[firearms]] and [[construction materials]]. The total labor force amounts to 3.4&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2095rank.html?countryName=Bulgaria&amp;countryCode=bu&amp;regionCode=eu&amp;rank=100#bu Labour force rank list], CIA The World Factbook.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic underinvestment in the scientific sector since 1990 forced many scientific professionals to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;Шопов, В. ''Влиянието на Европейското научно пространство върху проблема “Изтичане на мозъци” в балканските страни'', сп. Наука, бр.1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Bulgaria has traditions in astronomy, physics, nuclear technology, medical and pharmaceutical research, and maintains an [[History of Antarctica|Antarctic exploration]] program by means of an [[Bulgaria 1300|artificial satellite]] and a [[St. Kliment Ohridski Base|permanent research base]]. The [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] (BAS) is the leading scientific institution in the country and employs most of Bulgaria's researchers in its numerous branches.

Bulgarian scientists have made several notable discoveries and inventions, such as the prototype of the digital watch ([[Peter Petroff]]); [[galantamine]] ([[Dimitar Paskov]]);&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, M. and H.L.

&lt;/ref&gt; due to economic collapse, a low birth rate, and high emigration. In 1989 the population comprised 9,009,018 inhabitants, gradually falling (mainly due to the emigration) to 8,487,317 in 1992, 7,932,984 in 2001 and 7,504,868 in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;nsi2&quot;&gt;[http://www.nsi.bg/otrasal.php?otr=19&amp;a1=376&amp;a2=377&amp;a3=378#cont NSI population table as of 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;. The interest for emigration was highest in the first years after the fall of Zhivkov's regime and from 1989 to 1992 Bulgaria lost more than half million inhabitants. Thereafter the interest for emigration started reducing and now the population is comparatively stabilizing, the growth rate is again negative, but is much lower - in the past decade the country lost abaout 500 000 inhabitants, compared to more than 1 million in the previous decade. After the reduced emigrant interest, Bulgaria decrease with 20,000-30,000 people for a year, while some years after 1989 the country was decreasing with more than 150 000 people for a year. After the first EU census, held this year, the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria for now gives only provisional result, which is 7,351,234 inhabitants, so to the publishing of the final data in July, 2011 is expected increasing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nsi.bg/EPDOCS/Census2011pr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir|State Television Female Vocal Choir]] is the most famous performing folk ensemble, and received a [[Grammy Award]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;''see [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian classical music is represented by composers such as [[Emanuil Manolov]], [[Pancho Vladigerov]], [[Marin Goleminov]] and [[Georgi Atanasov (composer)|Georgi Atanasov]], opera singers [[Ghena Dimitrova]], [[Boris Christoff|Boris Hristov]] and [[Raina Kabaivanska]], and pianists [[Alexis Weissenberg]] and [[Vesselin Stanev]].

Bulgaria has a rich religious visual arts heritage, especially in [[fresco]]es, [[mural]]s and [[icon]]s, many of them produced by the medieval [[Painting of the Tarnovo Artistic School|Tarnovo Artistic School]].&lt;ref&gt;Graba, A. ''La peinture religiouse en Bulgarie'', Paris, 1928, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest pieces of Slavic literature were created in Medieval Bulgaria, such as ''The Didactic Gospel'' by [[Constantine of Preslav]] and ''An Account of Letters'' by [[Chernorizets Hrabar]], both written c. 893. Notable Bulgarian authors include late [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[Ivan Vazov]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] [[Pencho Slaveykov]] and [[Peyo Yavorov]], [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] [[Geo Milev]], [[science fiction]] writer [[Pavel Vezhinov]], novelist [[Dimitar Dimov]] and postmodernist [[Alek Popov]], best known for his novel ''Mission London'' and its successful movie adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novinitepro.bg/svejo/scena/zmisiya-london-chupi-rekordi-tvori-istoriya.html „Мисия Лондон” чупи рекорди, твори история {{bg icon}}], novinitepro.bg, 27 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; German-language writer [[Elias Canetti]] was the [[List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_country#Bulgaria|only Bulgarian]] to win the [[Nobel Prize]] (Literature, 1981).&lt;ref name=&quot;litenc&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Dagmar C.

| quote = Mass Media: In 2006 Bulgaria’s print and broadcast media generally were considered unbiased, although the government dominated broadcasting through the state-owned Bulgarian National Television (BNT) and Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) and print news dissemination through the largest press agency, the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency. [...]Human Rights: In the early 2000s, Bulgaria generally has been rated highly on the issue of human rights. However, some exceptions exist. Although '''the media have a record of unbiased reporting''', Bulgaria’s lack of specific legislation protecting the media from state interference is a theoretical weakness.

&lt;/ref&gt; The written media have no legal restrictions and newspaper publishing is entirely liberal.&lt;ref name=&quot;landscape&quot;&gt;[http://www.ejc.net/media_landscape/article/bulgaria/ Media Landscape – Bulgaria], European Journalism Centre&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive freedom of the press means that no exact number of publications can be established, although some research put an estimate of around 900 print media outlets for 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;landscape&quot;/&gt; The largest-circulation daily newspapers include ''[[Dneven Trud]]'' and ''[[24 Chasa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;landscape&quot;/&gt;

Non-printed media sources, such as [[television]] and [[radio]], are overseen by the Council for Electronic Media (CEM), an independent body with the authority to issue broadcasting licenses. Apart from a state-operated [[Bulgarian National Television|national television channel]], [[Bulgarian National Radio|radio station]] and the [[Bulgarian News Agency]], a large number of private television and radio stations exist. ''[[Slavi's Show]]'' and ''[[Gospodari Na Efira]]'' are among the most popular TV programs, both having more than 1,000,000 views per show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slusham.com/20-te-nay-gledani-predavaniya-sa-po-btv-bez-i.html 20-те най-гледани предавания са по bTV, без изключение!], slusham.com, January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, most Bulgarian media experience a number of negative trends, such as general degradation of media products, self-censorship and economic or political pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;media&quot;&gt;[http://www.soros.org/initiatives/media/articles_publications/publications/financial-crisis-media-20091201/bulgaria-20091201.pdf Footprint of Financial Crisis in the Media, Bulgaria Country Report], Open Society Institute, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

Internet media are growing in popularity due to the wide range of available opinions and viewpoints, lack of censorship and diverse content.&lt;ref name=&quot;media&quot;/&gt; Since 2000, a rapid increase in the number of Internet users has occurred. In 2000, they numbered 430,000, growing to 1,545,100 in 2004, and 3.4&amp;nbsp;million (48% penetration rate) in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/eu/bg.htm |title=Bulgaria Internet Usage Stats and Market Report |publisher=Internetworldstats.com |date=30 June 2010 |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Bulgarian cuisine}}
[[File:ЕленскаСливова.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Rakiya distilled in [[Elena, Bulgaria|Elena]], central Bulgaria]]

[[Yogurt]] (кисело мляко ''kiselo mlyako''), [[lukanka]] (луканка), [[banitsa]] (баница), [[shopska salad]] (шопска салата), [[lyutenitsa]] (лютеница), [[sirene]] (сирене) and [[kozunak]] (козунак) give Bulgaria a distinctive cuisine. Owing to the relatively warm climate and complex geography affording excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits, Bulgarian cuisine is diverse. Most dishes are oven baked, steamed, or in the form of [[stew]]. Deep-frying is uncommon, but grilling—especially different kinds of meats—is widely practiced. [[Pork]] is the most common meat, followed by [[chicken]] and [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. Oriental dishes such as [[moussaka]], [[gyuvech]], and [[baklava]] are widely consumed. Bulgarian cuisine is also noted for the quality of dairy products and salads, as well as the variety of wines and local alcoholic drinks such as [[rakiya]], [[mastika]] and [[menta]].

Exports of [[Bulgarian wine]] go worldwide, and until 1990 the country exported the world's second-largest total of bottled wine. As of 2007, 200,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes of wine were produced annually,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investor.bg/?cat=5&amp;id=60913 |title=Руснаците купиха 81 милиона литра българско вино |publisher=Investor.bg |accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 20th-largest total in the world.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of wine-producing countries]]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the more prominent local sorts are [[Dimiat]] and [[Mavrud]].

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport in Bulgaria|Football in Bulgaria|Bulgaria at the Olympics|Bulgaria men's national volleyball team}}

Bulgaria performs well in sports such as [[volleyball]], [[wrestling]], [[weight-lifting]], [[canoeing]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[shooting sports]], [[gymnastics]], [[chess]], and recently, [[sumo wrestling]] and [[tennis]]. The country fields one of the leading men's [[volleyball]] teams in [[Europe]] and in the world, ranked 6th in the world according to the 2010 [[FIVB]] rankings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/en/volleyball/Rankings/Rank_men_2009_01.asp |title=FIVB official rankings as per January&amp;nbsp;15, 2009 |publisher=Fivb.org |date=15 January 2009 |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the women's volleyball team finished second in European League 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus-fen.net/?id=n226457 Volleyball: Bulgaria wins second place in women’s European League], focus-nes.bg, 25 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cev.lu/mmp/online/website/main_menu/volleyball/european_league/2557/17141/17164/index_EN.html 2010 CEV European League – RESULTS], [[Confédération Européenne de Volleyball]] official website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Association football|Football]] has become by far the most popular sport in the country. [[Dimitar Berbatov]], who plays for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], is one of the most famous Bulgarian football players of the 21st century, while [[Hristo Stoichkov]], twice winner of the [[European Golden Shoe]], is the most successful Bulgarian player of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epfl-europeanleagues.com/fao/hristo_stoichkov.htm Hristo Stoichkov – Bulgarian League Ambassador], Professional Football Against Hunger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulgarian.ibox.bg/news/id_452784631 Hristo Stoichkov: For sure Barcelona will win tonight], news.bg, 27.05.2009&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent domestic football clubs include [[PFC CSKA Sofia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bgclubs.eu/ranking/points |title=Rankings of A Group |publisher=Bgclubs.eu |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ingo Faulhaber |url=http://www.iffhs.de/?a413f0e03790c443e0f40390b41be8b01905fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeedb883ccb05ff1d |title=Best club of 20th century ranking at the official site of the International Federation of Football History and Statistics |publisher=Iffhs.de |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[PFC Levski Sofia]]. Bulgaria's best performance at World Cup finals came in 1994, with a 4th place.

Bulgaria participates both in the Summer and Winter Olympics, and its first Olympic appearance dates back to the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic games]] in 1896, represented by Swiss gymnast [[Charles Champaud]]. Since then the country has appeared in most Summer Olympiads, and by 2010 had won a total of 218 medals: 52 gold, 86 silver, and 80 bronze, which puts it at 24th place in the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|all-time ranking]].

The '''Bryozoa''', also known as '''Ectoprocta''' or commonly as '''moss animals''', are a [[phylum]] of [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[invertebrate]] [[animal]]s. Typically about {{convert|0.5|mm|in}} long, they are [[filter feeder]]s that sieve food particles out of the water using a retractable [[lophophore]], a &quot;crown&quot; of [[tentacle]]s lined with [[cilia]]. Most [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] species live in tropical waters, but a few occur in [[oceanic trench]]es, and others are found in [[Geographical pole|polar]] waters. One [[class (biology)|class]] lives only in a variety of [[freshwater]] environments, and a few members of a mostly marine class prefer brackish water. Over 4,000&amp;nbsp;living species are known. One [[genus]] is solitary and the rest [[Colony (biology)|colonial]].

The phylum was originally called &quot;Polyzoa&quot;, but this term was superseded by &quot;Bryozoa&quot; in 1831. Another group of animals discovered subsequently, whose filtering mechanism looked similar, was also included in &quot;Bryozoa&quot; until 1869, when the two groups were noted to be very different internally. The more recently discovered group were given the name [[Entoprocta]], while the original &quot;Bryozoa&quot; were called &quot;Ectoprocta&quot;. However, &quot;Bryozoa&quot; has remained the more widely used term for the latter group.

Individuals in bryozoan (ectoproct) colonies are called '''''zooids''''', since they are not fully-independent animals. All colonies contain autozooids, which are responsible for feeding and [[excretion]]. Colonies of some [[class (biology)|classes]] have various types of non-feeding specialist zooids, some of which are hatcheries for fertilized eggs, and some classes also have special zooids for defense of the colony. The class [[Cheilostomata]] have the largest number of species, possibly because they have the widest range of specialist zooids. A few species can creep very slowly by using spiny defensive zooids as legs. Autozooids supply nutrients to non-feeding zooids by channels that vary between classes. All zooids, including those of the solitary species, consist of a ''cystid'' that provides the body wall and produces the [[exoskeleton]] and a ''polypide'' that contains the internal organs and the lophophore or other specialist extensions. Zooids have no special excretory organs, and the polypides of autozooids are scrapped when the polypides become overloaded by waste products; usually the body wall then grows a replacement polypide. In autozooids the gut is U-shaped, with the mouth inside the &quot;crown&quot; of tentacles and the anus outside it. Colonies take a variety of forms, including fans, bushes and sheets. The Cheilostomata produce [[biomineralization|mineralized]] exoskeletons and form single-layered sheets that encrust over surfaces.

Zooids of all the freshwater species are simultaneous [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although those of many marine species function first as males and then as females, their colonies always contain a combination of zooids that are in their male and female stages. All species emit [[sperm]] into the water. Some also release [[ovum|ova]] into the water, while others capture sperm via their tentacles to fertilize their ova internally. In some species the [[larva]]e have large yolks, go to feed, and quickly settle on a surface. Others produce larvae that have little yolk but swim and feed for a few days before settling. After settling, all larvae undergo a radical [[metamorphosis]] that destroys and rebuilds almost all the internal tissues. Freshwater species also produce statoblasts that lie dormant until conditions are favorable, which enables a colony's lineage to survive even if severe conditions kill the mother colony.

Predators of marine bryozoans include [[nudibranch]]s (sea slugs), fish, [[sea urchin]]s, [[pycnogonid]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[mite]]s and [[starfish]]. Freshwater bryozoans are preyed on by snails, insects, and fish. In [[Thailand]], many populations of one freshwater species have been wiped out by an [[introduced species]] of snail. A fast-growing invasive bryozoan off the northeast and northwest coasts of the USA has reduced [[kelp]] forests so much that it has affected local fish and invertebrate populations. Bryozoans have spread diseases to [[fish farm]]s and fishermen. Chemicals extracted from a marine bryozoan species have been investigated for treatment of [[cancer]] and [[Alzheimer's Disease]], but analyses have not been encouraging.

Mineralized skeletons of bryozoans appear in rocks from Early [[Ordovician]] [[Period (geology)|period]], about {{ma|480}}, while all other fossilized phyla appear in earlier periods. This has led researchers to suspect that bryozoans had arisen earlier but were initially unmineralized, and may have differed significantly from fossilized and modern forms. Early fossils are mainly of erect forms, but encrusting forms gradually became dominant. It is uncertain whether the phylum is [[monophyletic]]. Bryozoans' evolutionary relationships to other phyla are also unclear, partly because scientists' view of the family tree of animals is mainly influenced by better-known phyla. Both [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[molecular phylogeny]] analyses disagree over bryozoans' relationships with entoprocts, about whether bryozoans should be grouped with [[brachiopod]]s and [[phoronid]]s in [[Lophophorata]], and whether bryozoans should be considered [[protostome]]s or [[deuterostome]]s.

===Distinguishing features===
[[Image:Freshwater Bryozoan234.JPG|thumb|right|Freshwater bryozoan with lophophore extended]]
Bryozoans, [[Phoronida|phoronids]] and [[Brachiopoda|brachiopods]] [[Filter feeding|strain food out of the water]] by means of a [[lophophore]], a &quot;crown&quot; of hollow tentacles. Bryozoans form colonies consisting of [[Cloning|clone]]s called zooids that are typically about {{convert|0.5|mm|in}} long.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; Phoronids resemble bryozoan zooids but are {{convert|2|to|20|cm|in}} long and, although they often grow in clumps, do not form colonies consisting of clones.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesPhoronida&quot; /&gt; Brachiopods, generally thought to be closely related to bryozoans and phoronids, are distinguished by having shells rather like those of [[bivalve]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBrachiopoda&quot; /&gt; All three of these [[phylum|phyla]] have a [[coelom]], an internal cavity lined by [[mesothelium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesPhoronida&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBrachiopoda&quot; /&gt; 
Some encrusting bryozoan colonies with [[biomineralization|mineralized]] [[exoskeleton]]s look very like small corals. However, bryozoan colonies are founded by an ancestrula, which is round rather than shaped like a normal zooid of that species. On the other hand the founding polyp of a coral has a shape like that of its daughter polyps, and coral zooids have no coelom or lophophore.&lt;ref name=&quot;RichFenton1997Bryozoans&quot; /&gt;

[[Entoprocta|Entoprocts]], another phylum of filter-feeders, look rather like bryozoans but their lophophore-like feeding structure has solid tentacles, their [[anus]] lies inside rather than outside the base of the &quot;crown&quot; and they have no [[coelom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesEntoprocta&quot; /&gt;

The exoskeleton may be organic ([[chitin]], [[polysaccharide]] or [[protein]]) or made of the mineral [[calcium carbonate]].

The most common type of zooid is the feeding autozooid, in which the polypide bears a &quot;crown&quot; of hollow tentacles called a [[lophophore]], which captures food particles from the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt; In all colonies a large percentage of zooids are autozooids, and some consist entirely of autozooids, some of which also engage in reproduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinneyJackson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McKinney|first=F.K.|coauthors=Jackson, J.B.C.|title=Bryozoan evolution|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1991|pages=1–13|chapter=Bryozoans as modular machines|isbn=9780226560472 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=TMnsG36wHoIC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Avicularia+bryozoa|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic shape of the &quot;crown&quot; is a full circle. In the [[class (biology)|class]] [[Phylactolaemata]] the crown appears U-shaped, but this impression is created by a deep dent in the rim of the crown, which has no gap in the fringe of tentacles.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; The sides of the tentacles bear fine hairs called [[cilia]], whose beating drives a water current from the tips of the tentacles to their bases, where it exits. Food particles that collide with the tentacles are trapped by [[mucus]], and further cilia on the inner surfaces of the tentacles convey the particles towards the mouth, which lies in the center of the base of the &quot;crown&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesLophoporata&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method used by ectoprocts is known as &quot;upstream collecting&quot;, as food particles are captured before they pass through the field of cilia that creates the feeding current. This method is also used by [[phoronid]]s, [[brachiopod]]s and [[pterobranch]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riisgård|first=H.U.|year=2000|title=Downstream collecting in ciliary suspension feeders: the catch-up principle|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=207|pages=33–51|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/207/m207p033.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=12 September 2009|doi=10.3354/meps207033|last2=Nielsen|first2=C|last3=Larsen|first3=PS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lophophore and mouth are mounted on a flexible tube, called the &quot;invert&quot; because it can be turned inside-out and withdrawn into the polypide,&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; rather like the finger of a rubber glove; in this position the lophophore lies inside the invert and is folded like the spokes of an umbrella. The invert is withdrawn, sometimes within 60&amp;nbsp;[[millisecond]]s, by a pair of retractor muscles that are anchored at the far end of the cystid. Sensors at the tips of the tentacles may check for signs of danger before the invert and lophophore are fully extended. Extension is driven by an increase in internal fluid pressure, which species with flexible exoskeletons produce by contracting circular muscles that lie just inside the body wall,&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; while species with a membranous sac use circular muscles to squeeze this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2001InEncOfLifeSci&quot; /&gt; Some species with rigid exoskeletons have a flexible membrane that replaces part of the exoskeleton, and transverse muscles anchored on the far side of the exoskeleton increase the fluid pressure by pulling the membrane inwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot;/&gt; In others there is no gap in the protective skeleton, and the transverse muscles pull on a flexible sac which is connected to the water outside by a small pore; the expansion of the sac increases the pressure inside the body and pushes the invert and lophophore out.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; In some species the retracted invert and lophophore are protected by an operculum (&quot;lid&quot;), which is closed by muscles and opened by fluid pressure. In one [[class (biology)|class]], a hollow lobe called the &quot;epistome&quot; overhands the mouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt;

The gut is U-shaped, running from the mouth, in the center of the lophophore, down into the animal's interior and then back to the [[anus]], which is located on the invert, outside and usually below the lophophore.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; A network of strands of [[mesothelium]] called &quot;funiculi&quot; (&quot;little ropes&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RanHouDictFuniculus&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Random House Dictionary|publisher=Random House |chapter=funiculus|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/funiculus|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;) connects the mesothelium covering the gut with that lining the body wall. The wall of each strand is made of mesothelium, and surrounds a space filled with fluid, thought to be blood.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; A colony's zooids are connected, enabling autozooids to share food with each other and with any non-feeding heterozooids.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; The method of connection varies between the different classes of bryozoans, ranging from quite large gaps in the body walls to small pores through which nutrients are passed by funiculi.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2001InEncOfLifeSci&quot; /&gt; 

There is a nerve ring round the pharynx (throat) and a [[ganglion]] that serves as a brain to one side of this. Nerves run from the ring and ganglion to the tentacles and to the rest of the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; Bryozoans have no specialized sense organs, but [[cilia]] on the tentacles act as sensors. Members of the [[genus]] ''[[Bugula]]'' [[phototropism|grow towards the sun]], and therefore must be able to detect light.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; In colonies of some species, signals are transmitted between zooids through nerves that pass through pores in the body walls, and coordinate activities such as feeding and the retraction of lophophores.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt;

The solitary individuals of ''Monobryozoon'' are autozooids with pear-shaped bodies.

Some authorities use the term ''avicularia'' to refer to any type of zooid in which the lophophore is replaced by an extension that serves some protective function,&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinneyJackson&quot; /&gt; while others restrict the term to those that defend the colony by snapping at invaders and small predators, killing some and biting the [[appendage]]s of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; In some species the snapping zooids are mounted on a peduncle (stalk), their bird-like appearance responsible for the term&amp;nbsp;– [[Charles Darwin]] described these as like &quot;the head and beak of a vulture in miniature, seated on a neck and capable of movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinneyJackson&quot; /&gt; Stalked avicularia are placed upside-down on their stalks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt; The &quot;lower jaws&quot; are modified versions of the opercula that protect the retracted lophophores in autozooids of some species, and are snapped shut &quot;like a mousetrap&quot; by similar muscles,&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; while the beak-shaped upper jaw is the inverted body wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt; In other species the avicularia are stationary box-like zooids laid the normal way up, so that the modified operculum snaps down against the body wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt; In both types the modified operculum is opened by other muscles that attach to it,&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinneyJackson&quot; /&gt; or by internal muscles that raise the fluid pressure by pulling on a flexible membrane.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; The actions of these snapping zooids are controlled by small, highly modified polypides that are located inside the &quot;mouth&quot; and bear tufts of short sensory [[cilia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt; These zooids appear in various positions: some take the place of autozooids, some fit into small gaps between autozooids, and small avicularia may occur on the surfaces of other zooids.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinneyJackson&quot; /&gt;

In vibracula, regarded by some as a type of avicularia, the operculum is modified to form a long bristle that has a wide range of motion. They may function as defenses against predators and invaders, or as cleaners. In some species that form mobile colonies, vibracula around the edges are used as legs for burrowing and walking.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinneyJackson&quot; /&gt;

====Other types of colonial zooid====
Kenozooids (from Greek κενος meaning &quot;empty&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liddell|first=H.G.|coauthors=Scott|others=R.|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1940|chapter=kenos|isbn=0198642261|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2356587|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;) consist only of the body wall and funicular strands crossing the interior,&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; and no polypide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt; In some species they form the stems of branching structures, while in others they act as spacers that enable colonies to grow quickly in a new direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinneyJackson&quot; /&gt;

Spinozooids form defensive spines, and sometimes appear on top of autozooids. Gonozooids act as brood chambers for fertilized eggs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt; Some species have miniature nanozooids with small single-tentacled polypides, and these may grow on other zooids or within the body walls of autozooids that have degenerated.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinneyJackson&quot; /&gt;

===Colony forms and composition===
[[File:Bryozoan 300.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A marine colony]]
Although zooids are microscopic, colonies range in size from {{convert|1|cm|in|sp=us}} to over {{convert|1|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; However, the majority are under {{convert|10|cm|in|sp=us}} across.&lt;ref name=&quot;RichFenton1997Bryozoans&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rich|first=T.H.|coauthors=Fenton, M.A., and Fenton, C.L.|title=The fossil book|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1997|pages=142–152|chapter=&quot;Moss Animals&quot;, or Bryozoans|isbn=9780486293714|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_ntSspji0LYC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=bryozoans#v=onepage&amp;q=bryozoans|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shapes of colonies vary widely, depend on the pattern of budding by which they grow, the variety of zooids present and the type and amount of skeletal material they [[secretion|secrete]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt;

Some marine species are bush-like or fan-like, supported by &quot;trunks&quot; and &quot;branches&quot; formed by kenozooids, with feeding autozooids growing from these. Colonies of these types are generally [[biomineralization|unmineralized]] but may have [[exoskeleton]]s made of [[chitin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; Others look like small [[coral]]s, producing heavy lime skeletons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Branch|first=M.L.|coauthors=Griffiths, C.I., and Beckley, L.E.|title=Two Oceans - A Guide to the Marine Life of Southern Africa|publisher=Struik|year=2007|pages=104–110|chapter=Bryozoa: Moss or Lace Animals|isbn=9781770076334|url=http://books.google.com/?id=W_2QB8ftLgcC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=bryozoa+lace+animal&amp;q=|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species form colonies which consist of sheets of autozooids. These sheets may form leaves, tufts or, in the [[genus]] ''[[Thalmoporella]]'', structures that resemble an open head of [[lettuce]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; 

The most common marine form, however, is encrusting, in which a one-layer sheet of zooids spreads over a hard surface or over seaweed. Some encrusting colonies may grow to over {{convert|50|cm|ft|sp=us}} and contain about 2,000,000&amp;nbsp;zooids.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; These species generally have exoskeletons reinforced with [[calcium carbonate]], and the openings through which the lophophores protrude are on the top or outer surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; The moss-like appearance of encrusting colonies is responsible for the phylum's alternative name Bryozoa ([[Ancient Greek]] words βρυος ''bryos'' meaning &quot;moss&quot; and ζωον ''zoon'' meaning &quot;animal&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;SOED1959Bryozoa&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=W.|coauthors=Fowler, H.W., Coulson, J. and Onions, C.T.|title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University|year=1959|chapter=Bryozoa|isbn=0198606133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large colonies of encrusting species often have &quot;[[chimney]]s&quot;, gaps in the canopy of lophophores, through which they swiftly expel water that has been sieved, and thus avoid re-filtering water that is already exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eckman|first=J.E.|month=December | year=1998|title=A Model of Particle Capture by Bryozoans in Turbulent Flow: Significance of Colony Form|volume=152|pages=861–880 | doi=10.1086/286214|journal=The American Naturalist|pmid=18811433|last2=Okamura|first2=B|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are formed by patches of non-feeding heterozooids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=S.|title=Life in moving fluids|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|edition=2|pages=191|chapter=Life in velocity gradients|isbn=978-0-691-02616-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XBqncfXFsOIC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=bryozoan+chimney&amp;q=|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; New chimneys appear near the edges of expanding colonies, at points where the speed of the outflow is already high, and do not change position if the water flow changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=von Dassow|first=M.|title=Function-Dependent Development in a Colonial Animal |journal=Biological Bulletin|volume=211|pages=76–82|url=http://www.biolbull.org/cgi/content/full/211/1/76|accessdate=2009-08-05|doi=10.2307/4134580|issn=00063185|date= August 1, 2006 | issue=1|pmid=16946244|jstor=4134580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some freshwater species secrete a mass of gelatinous material, up to {{convert|1|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter, to which the zooids stick. Other freshwater species have plant-like shapes with &quot;trunks&quot; and &quot;branches&quot;, which may stand erect or spread over the surface. A few species can creep at about {{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us}} per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt;

Each colony grows by [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] [[budding]] from a single zooid known as the ancestrula,&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; which is round rather than shaped like a normal zooid.&lt;ref name=&quot;RichFenton1997Bryozoans&quot; /&gt; This occurs at the tips of &quot;trunks&quot; or &quot;branches&quot; in forms that have this structure. Encrusting colonies grow round their edges. In species with [[calcareous]] exoskeletons, these do not mineralize until the zooids are fully grown. Colony lifespans range from one to about 12&amp;nbsp;years, and the short-lived species pass though several generations in one season.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt;

Species that produce defensive zooids do so only when threats have already appeared, and may do so within 48&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt; The theory of &quot;induced defenses&quot; suggests that production of defenses is expensive and that colonies which defend themselves too early or too heavily will have reduced growth rates and lifespans. This &quot;last minute&quot; approach to defense is feasible because the loss of zooids to a single attack is unlikely to be significant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt; Colonies of some encrusting species also produce special heterozooids to limit the expansion of other encrusting organisms, especially other bryozoans. In some cases this response is more belligerent if the opposition is smaller, which suggests that zooids on the edge of a colony can somehow sense the size of the opponent. Some species consistently prevail against certain others, but most [[turf war]]s are indecisive and the combatants soon turn to growing in uncontested areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt; Bryozoans competing for territory do not use the sophisticated techniques employed by [[sponge]]s or [[coral]]s, possibly because the shortness of bryozoan lifespans makes heavy investment in turf wars unprofitable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt;

==Taxonomy and Evolution==
The phylum was originally called &quot;Polyzoa&quot;, but this name was soon replaced by Ehrenberg's term &quot;Bryozoa&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeattyBlackwelder1974&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayr1968BryozoaVersusEctoprocta&quot; /&gt; The name &quot;Bryozoa&quot; was originally applied only to the animals also known as &quot;Ectoprocta&quot;, in which the [[anus]] lies outside the &quot;crown&quot; of tentacles (based on the [[Ancient Greek]] prefix ἐκτο meaning &quot;outside&quot; and word πρωκτος meaning &quot;anus&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=W.|coauthors=Fowler, H.W, Coulson, J. and Onions, C.T.|title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1964|chapter=Ecto-|isbn=0198606133}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the discovery of the [[Entoprocta]], in which the anus lies within a &quot;crown&quot; of tentacles (based on the Ancient Greek prefix ἐντο meaning &quot;inside&quot; and word πρωκτος meaning &quot;anus&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=W.|coauthors=Fowler, H.W, Coulson, J. and Onions, C.T.|title=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1964|chapter=Ento-|isbn=0198606133}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the name &quot;Bryozoa&quot; was used at [[phylum]] level to include the two [[class (biology)|classes]] Ectoprocta and Entoprocta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halanych2004AnimalPhylogeny&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halanych|first=K.M..|year=2004|title=The new view of animal phylogeny|journal= Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=35|pages=229–256|url=http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~dpiau/cdem/130124b.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=21009-04-17 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.35.112202.130124}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1869 Hinrich Nitsche regarded the two groups as quite distinct for a variety of reasons, and coined the name &quot;Ectoprocta&quot; for Ehrenberg's &quot;Bryozoa&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FuchsObstSundberg2009ComprMolPhyloOfBryozoa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HausdorfHelmkampfMeyer2007Spiralian Phylogenomics&quot; /&gt; Despite their apparently similar methods of feeding, they differed markedly anatomically; in addition to the different positions of the anus, ectoprocts have hollow tentacles and a [[coelom]], while entoprocts have solid tentacles and no coelom. Hence the two groups are now widely regarded as separate phyla, and the name &quot;Bryozoa&quot; is now synonymous with &quot;Ectoprocta&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halanych2004AnimalPhylogeny&quot; /&gt; This has remained the majority view ever since, although most publications have preferred the name &quot;Bryozoa&quot; rather than &quot;Ectoprocta&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayr1968BryozoaVersusEctoprocta&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mayr|first=E.|year=1968|title=Bryozoa versus Ectoprocta|journal=Systematic Zoology|volume=17|issue=2|pages=213–216|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2412368|accessdate=30 September 2009|doi=10.2307/2412368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless some notable scientists have continued to regard the &quot;Ectoprocta&quot; and Entoprocta as close relatives and group them under &quot;Bryozoa&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HausdorfHelmkampfMeyer2007Spiralian Phylogenomics&quot; /&gt;

===Fossil record===
[[Image:OilShaleFossilsEstonia.jpg|thumb|Bryozoan fossils in an Upper [[Ordovician]] oil shale ([[kukersite]]), northern [[Estonia]].]]
Fossils of about 15,000&amp;nbsp;bryozoan species have been found. Marine [[Taxon|taxa]] with [[biomineralization|mineralized]] skeletons appear in rocks dating from the Arenigian stage of the Early [[Ordovician]] [[Period (geology)|period]], about {{ma|480}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;RichFenton1997Bryozoans&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torsvik|first=T.H.|month=January | year=1991|journal=Geology|volume=19|issue=1|pages=7–10|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019&lt;0007:COPOB&gt;2.3.CO;2|title=Cambrian-Ordovician paleogeography of Baltica|last2=Ryan|first2=Paul D.|last3=Trench|first3=Allan|last4=Harper|first4=David A.T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point all the modern [[Order (biology)|orders]] of [[Stenolaemata|stenolaemates]] were present,&lt;ref name=&quot;DewelWinstonMcKinney2001Deconstructing&quot; /&gt; and the [[Ctenostomata|ctenostome]] order of [[Gymnolaemata|gymnolaemates]] had appeared by the Middle Ordovician, about {{ma|465}}. Other types of [[filter feeder]]s appeared around the same time, which suggests that some change made the environment more favorable for this lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;RichFenton1997Bryozoans&quot; /&gt; Fossils of [[Cheilostomata|cheilostomates]], another order of gymnolaemates, first appear in the Mid [[Jurassic]], about {{ma|172}}, and these have been the most abundant and diverse bryozoans from the [[Cretaceous]] to the present.&lt;ref name=&quot;RichFenton1997Bryozoans&quot; /&gt; Evidence compiled from the last 100&amp;nbsp;million years show that cheilostomates consistently grew over cyclostomates in territorial struggles, which may help to explain how cheilostomates replaced cyclostomates as the dominant marine bryozoans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKinney|first=F.K.|year=1994|title=One hundred million years of competitive interactions between bryozoan clades: asymmetrical but not escalating|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=56|issue=3|pages=465–481|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1995.tb01105.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine fossils from the [[Paleozoic]] era, which ended {{ma|251}}, are mainly of erect forms, those from the [[Mesozoic]] are fairly equally divided by erect and encrusting forms, and more recent ones are predominantly encrusting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=R.|title=Reef evolution|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|pages=235–237|isbn=0-19-857784|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H_ah6Hzib4AC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=bryozoa+distribution+range&amp;q=|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fossils of the soft, freshwater [[Phylactolaemata|phylactolaemates]] are very rare,&lt;ref name=&quot;RichFenton1997Bryozoans&quot; /&gt; appear in and after the Late Permian (which began about {{ma|260}}) and consist entirely of their durable statoblasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;MassardGeimer2008FreshwaterBryoDiversity&quot; /&gt; There are no known fossils of freshwater members of other classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;MassardGeimer2008FreshwaterBryoDiversity&quot; /&gt;

Since all the other phyla that have left fossils are found in [[Cambrian]] rocks, it is surprising that the earliest bryozoan fossil dates from the Ordovician, which immediately followed the Cambrian. This suggests that the first bryozoans appeared much earlier and were entirely soft-bodied, and the Ordovician fossils record the appearance of mineralized skeletons in this phylum.&lt;ref name=&quot;FuchsObstSundberg2009ComprMolPhyloOfBryozoa&quot; /&gt; The Early Ordovician fossils may also represent forms that had already become significantly different from the original members of the phylum.&lt;ref name=&quot;DewelWinstonMcKinney2001Deconstructing&quot; /&gt;

===Evolutionary family tree===
Scientists are divided about whether the Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) are a [[monophyletic]] group (whether they include all and only a single ancestor species and all its descendants), about what are the phylum's closest relatives in the family tree of animals, and even about whether they should be regarded as members of the [[protostome]]s or [[deuterostome]]s, the two major groups that account for all moderately complex animals.

[[Image:OrdovicianEdrio.jpg|thumb|right|An Upper [[Ordovician]] cobble with the [[edrioasteroid]] ''Cystaster stellatus'' and the thin branching cyclostome bryozoan ''Corynotrypa''. Kope Formation, northern Kentucky.]]
The traditional view is that the Bryozoa are a monophyletic group, in which the [[class (biology)|class]] [[Phylactolaemata]] is most closely related to [[Stenolaemata]] and [[Ctenostomata]], the classes that appear earliest in the fossil record.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoodLore2005PhylactolaemateMolPhylo&quot; /&gt; However, in 2005 a [[molecular phylogeny]] study that focused on phylactolaemates concluded that these are more closely related to the phylum [[Phoronid]]a, and especially to the only phoronid species that is colonial, than they are to the other ectoproct classes. That implies that the Entoprocta are not monophyletic, as the Phoronida are a sub-group of ectoprocts but the standard definition of Entoprocta excludes the Phoronida.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoodLore2005PhylactolaemateMolPhylo&quot; /&gt; In 2009 another [[molecular phylogeny]] study, using a combination of genes from [[mitochondria]] and the [[cell nucleus]], concluded that Bryozoa is a [[monophyletic]] phylum, in other words includes all the descendants of a common ancestor that is itself a bryozoan. The analysis also concluded that the [[class (biology)|classes]] [[Phylactolaemata]], [[Stenolaemata]] and [[Gymnolaemata]] are also monophyletic, but could not determine whether [[Stenolaemata]] are more closely related to Phylactolaemata or [[Gymnolaemata]]. The Gymnolaemata are traditionally divided into the soft-bodied [[Ctenostomata]] and [[biomineralization|mineralized]] Cheilostomata, but the 2009 analysis considered it more likely that neither of these [[order (biology)|orders]] is monophyletic and that mineralized [[skeleton]]s probably evolved more than once within the early Gymnolaemata.&lt;ref name=&quot;FuchsObstSundberg2009ComprMolPhyloOfBryozoa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=J.|month=July | year=2009|title=The first comprehensive molecular phylogeny of Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) based on combined analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial genes|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=52|issue=1|pages=225–233|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2009.01.021|pmid=19475710|last2=Obst|first2=M|last3=Sundberg|first3=P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryozoans' relationships with other phyla are uncertain and controversial. Traditional phylogeny, based on [[anatomy]] and on the development of the adult forms from [[embryo]]s, has produced no enduring consensus about the position of ectoprocts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2002PhyloPosOfEntoproctaEctoproctaPhoronidaBrachiopoda&quot; /&gt; Attempts to reconstruct the family tree of animals have largely ignored ectoprocts and other &quot;minor phyla&quot;, which have received little scientific study because they are generally tiny, have relatively simple body plans, and have little impact on human economies&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; despite the fact that the &quot;minor phyla&quot; include most of the variety in the evolutionary history of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of Ruth Dewel, Judith Winston and Frank McKinney, &quot;Our standard interpretation of bryozoan [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[embryology]] is a construct resulting from over 100&amp;nbsp;years of attempts to synthesize a single framework for all invertebrates,&quot; and takes little account of some peculiar features of ectoprocts.&lt;ref name=&quot;DewelWinstonMcKinney2001Deconstructing&quot; /&gt; In ectoprocts, all of the larva's internal organs are destroyed during the metamorphosis to the adult form and the adult's organs are built from the larva's [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and [[mesoderm]], while in other [[bilateria]]ns some organs including the gut are built from [[endoderm]]. In most bilaterian embryos the blastopore, a dent in the outer wall, deepens to become the larva's gut, but in ectoprocts the blastopore disappears and a new dent becomes the point from which the gut grows. The ectoproct coelom is formed by neither of the processes used by other bilaterians, [[enterocoely]], in which pouches that form on the wall of the gut become separate cavities, nor [[schizocoely]], in which the tissue between the gut and the body wall splits, forming paired cavities.&lt;ref name=&quot;DewelWinstonMcKinney2001Deconstructing&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewel|first=R.A.|coauthors=Winston, J.E., and McKinney, F.J.|others=M.E.|title=Bryozoan studies 2001: proceedings of the Twelfth International Bryozoology Conference|editor=Wyse Jacksdon, P.E., Buttler, C.E. and Spencer Jones, M.E.|publisher=Swets and Zeitlinger|location=Lisse|year=2002|pages=93–96|chapter=Deconstructing byozoans: origin and consequeces of a unique body plan|isbn=9058093883|url=http://books.google.com/?id=4-jlUfCMlQkC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=ectoprocta+bryozoa+phylogeny&amp;q=ectoprocta%20bryozoa%20phylogeny|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecular phylogeny, which attempts to work out the evolutionary family tree of organisms by comparing their [[biochemistry]] and especially their [[gene]]s, has done much to clarify the relationships between the better-known [[invertebrate]] phyla.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halanych2004AnimalPhylogeny&quot; /&gt; However, the shortage of genetic data about &quot;minor phyla&quot; such as bryozoans and [[Entoprocta|entoprocts]] has left their relationships to other groups unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;HausdorfHelmkampfMeyer2007Spiralian Phylogenomics&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hausdorf|first=B.|year=2007|title=Spiralian Phylogenomics Supports the Resurrection of Bryozoa Comprising Ectoprocta and Entoprocta|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=24|issue=12|pages=2723–2729|doi=10.1093/molbev/msm214|pmid=17921486|last2=Helmkampf|first2=M|last3=Meyer|first3=A|last4=Witek|first4=A|last5=Herlyn|first5=H|last6=Bruchhaus|first6=I|last7=Hankeln|first7=T|last8=Struck|first8=TH|last9=Lieb|first9=B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When entoprocts were discovered in the 19th century, they and bryozoans (ectoprocts) were regarded as classes within the phylum Bryozoa, because both groups were [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] animals that [[filter feeder|filter-fed]] by means of a crown of tentacles that bore [[cilia]]. However, from 1869 onwards increasing awareness of differences, including the position of the entoproct [[anus]] inside the feeding structure and the difference in the early [[Cleavage (embryo)|pattern of division]] of cells in their [[embryo]]s, caused scientists to regard the two groups as separate phyla,&lt;ref name=&quot;HausdorfHelmkampfMeyer2007Spiralian Phylogenomics&quot; /&gt; and &quot;Bryozoa&quot; became just an alternative name for ectoprocts, in which the anus is outside the feeding organ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halanych2004AnimalPhylogeny&quot; /&gt; A series of molecular phylogeny studies from 1996 to 2006 have also concluded that bryozoans (ectoprocts) and entoprocts are not sister groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;HausdorfHelmkampfMeyer2007Spiralian Phylogenomics&quot; /&gt; However, two well-known zoologists, Claus Nielsen and [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]], maintain on anatomical and developmental grounds that bryozoans and entoprocts are member of the same phylum, Bryozoa. A molecular phylogeny study in 2007 also supported this old idea, while its conclusions about other phyla agreed with those of several other analyses.&lt;ref name=&quot;HausdorfHelmkampfMeyer2007Spiralian Phylogenomics&quot; /&gt;

By 1891 bryozoans (ectoprocts) were grouped with [[phoronid]]s in a super-phylum called &quot;Tentaculata&quot;. In the 1970s comparisons between phoronid larvae and the cyphonautes larva of some gymnolaete bryozoans produced suggestions that the bryozoans, most of which are colonial, evolved from a semi-colonial species of phoronid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2001AnimalEvoPhylumEctoprocta&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Nielsen|first=C.|title=Animal evolution: interrelationships of the living phyla|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|edition=2|pages=244–264|chapter=Phylum Ectoprocta|isbn=0198506813|url=http://books.google.com/?id=UmCg6c0HkqMC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;lpg=PA257&amp;dq=ectoprocta+bryozoa+phylogeny&amp;q=ectoprocta%20bryozoa%20phylogeny|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brachiopod]]s were also assigned to the &quot;Tentaculata&quot;, which were renamed [[Lophophorata]] as they all use a [[lophophore]] for filter feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halanych2004AnimalPhylogeny&quot; /&gt; Although the majority of scientists accept this,&lt;ref name=&quot;Halanych2004AnimalPhylogeny&quot; /&gt; Claus Nielsen thinks these similarities are superficial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2002PhyloPosOfEntoproctaEctoproctaPhoronidaBrachiopoda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=C.|year=2002|title=The Phylogenetic Position of Entoprocta, Ectoprocta, Phoronida, and Brachiopoda|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=42|issue=3|pages=685–691|doi=10.1093/icb/42.3.685}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lophophorata are usually defined as animals with a lophophore, a three-part coelom and a U-shaped gut.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2001AnimalEvoPhylumEctoprocta&quot; /&gt; In Nielsen's opinion, phoronids' and brachiopods' lophophores are more like those of [[pterobranch]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2002PhyloPosOfEntoproctaEctoproctaPhoronidaBrachiopoda&quot; /&gt; which are members of the phylum [[Hemichordata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryozoan's tentacles bear cells with multiple [[cilia]], while the corresponding cells of phoronids', brachiopods' and pterobranchs' lophophores have one cilium per cell; and bryozoan tentacles have no hemal canal (&quot;blood vessel&quot;), which those of the other three phyla have.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2002PhyloPosOfEntoproctaEctoproctaPhoronidaBrachiopoda&quot; /&gt;

If the grouping of bryozoans with phoronids and brachiopods into Lophophorata is correct, the next issue is whether the Lophophorata are [[protostome]]s, along with most invertebrate phyla, or [[deuterostome]]s, along with [[chordate]]s, [[hemichordate]]s and [[echinoderm]]s. The traditional view was that lophophorates were a mix of protostome and deuterostome features. Research from the 1970s onwards suggested they were deuterostomes, because of some features that were thought characteristic of deuterostomes: a three-part coelom; radial rather than spiral cleavage in the development of the embryo;&lt;ref name=&quot;Halanych2004AnimalPhylogeny&quot; /&gt; and formation of the coelom by [[enterocoely]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2002PhyloPosOfEntoproctaEctoproctaPhoronidaBrachiopoda&quot; /&gt; However the coelom of ectoproct larvae shows no sign of division into three sections,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2001AnimalEvoPhylumEctoprocta&quot; /&gt; and that of adult ectoprocts is different from that of other [[coelomate]] phyla as it is built anew from epidermis and mesoderm after metamorphosis has destroyed the larval coelom.&lt;ref name=&quot;DewelWinstonMcKinney2001Deconstructing&quot; /&gt; 

Molecular phylogeny analyses from 1995 onwards, using a variety of biochemical evidence and analytical techniques, placed the lophophorates as protostomes and closely related to [[annelid]]s and [[mollusc]]s in a super-phylum called [[Lophotrochozoa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Halanych2004AnimalPhylogeny&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HelmkampfBruchhausHausdorf2008PhylogenOfLophophorates&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helmkampf|first=M.|year=2008|title=Phylogenomic analyses of lophophorates (brachiopods, phoronids and bryozoans) confirm the Lophotrochozoa concept|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological|volume=275|pages=1927–1933|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0372|last2=Bruchhaus|first2=Iris|last3=Hausdorf|first3=Bernhard|pmid=18495619|issue=1645|pmc=2593926}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Total evidence&quot; analyses, which used both morphological features and a relatively small set of genes, came to various conclusions, mostly favoring a close relationship between lophophorates and Lophotrochozoa.&lt;ref name=&quot;HelmkampfBruchhausHausdorf2008PhylogenOfLophophorates&quot; /&gt; A study in 2008, using a larger set of genes, concluded that the lophophorates were closer to the Lophotrochozoa than to deuterostomes, but also that the lophophorates were not monophyletic. Instead, it concluded that brachiopods and phoronids formed a monophyletic group, but bryozoans (ectoprocts) were closest to entoprocts, supporting the original definition of &quot;Bryozoa&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HelmkampfBruchhausHausdorf2008PhylogenOfLophophorates&quot; /&gt;

==Physiology==
===Feeding and excretion===
Most species are [[filter feeder]]s that sieve small particles, mainly [[phytoplankton]] (microscopic floating plants), out of the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; The freshwater species ''[[Plumatella emarginata]]'' feeds on [[diatom]]s, [[green algae]], [[cyanobacteria]], non-[[photosynthetic]] [[bacteria]], [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[rotifer]]s, [[protozoa]], small [[nematode]]s, and microscopic [[crustacean]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CallaghanKarlson2002SummerDormancy&quot; /&gt; While the currents that bryozoans generate to draw food towards the mouth are well understood, the exact method of capture is still debated. All species also flick larger particles towards the mouth with a tentacle, and a few capture [[zooplankton]] (planktonic animals) by using their tentacles as cages. In addition the tentacles, whose surface area is increased by [[microvilli]] (small hairs and pleats), absorb [[organic compound]]s dissolved in the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; Unwanted particles may be flicked away by tentacles or shut out by closing the mouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; A study in 2008 showed that both encrusting and erect colonies fed more quickly and grew faster in gentle than in strong currents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pratt2008WhereFlowRight&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=M.C.|year=2008|title=Living where the flow is right: How flow affects feeding in bryozoans|journal= Integrative and Comparative Biology|publisher=The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=48|issue=6|pages=808–822|doi=10.1093/icb/icn052  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some species the first part of the stomach forms a muscular [[gizzard]] lined with [[chitin]]ous teeth that crush armored prey such as [[diatom]]s. Wave-like [[peristalsis|peristaltic]] contractions move the food through the stomach for digestion. The final section of the stomach is lined with [[cilia]] (minute hairs) that compress undigested solids, which then pass through the [[intestine]] and out through the [[anus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; 

There are no [[nephridia]] (&quot;little kidneys&quot;) or other [[excretory system|excretory]] organs in bryzoa,&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt; and it is thought that [[ammonia]] [[molecular diffusion|diffuses]] out through the body wall and lophophore.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; More complex waste products are not excreted but accumulate in the [[polypide]], which degenerates after a few weeks. Some of the old polypide is recycled, but much of it remains as a large mass of dying cells containing accumulated wastes, and this is compressed into a &quot;brown body&quot;. When the degeneration is complete, the cystid (outer part of the animal) produces a new polypide, and the brown body remains in the [[coelom]], or in the stomach of the new polypide and is expelled next time the animal [[defecate]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt;

===Respiration and circulation===
There are no respiratory organs, [[heart]] or [[blood vessel]]s. Instead zooids absorb [[oxygen]] and eliminate [[carbon dioxide]] through the body wall and especially the lophophore.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; The fluid in the coelom transports gases and nutrients and its circulation is passive, except that some relatively large species use cilia to boost its speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; The different bryozoan groups use various methods to share nutrients and oxygen between zooids: some have quite large gaps in the body walls, allowing the coelomic fluid to circulate freely; in others the funiculi (internal &quot;little ropes&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RanHouDictFuniculus&quot; /&gt;) of adjacent zooids connect via small pores in the body wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2001InEncOfLifeSci&quot; /&gt;

===Reproduction and life cycles===
[[Image:ThecideanZalas.jpg|thumb|Encrusting cyclostome bryozoans (B), the one on the right showing swollen gonozooids; T = [[Thecideida|thecideide]] brachiopod and S = [[sabellida|sabellid]] worm tube; [[Jurassic]] of [[Poland]].]]
Zooids of all phylactolaemate species are simultaneous [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although those of many marine species are protandric, in other words function first as males and then as females, their colonies contain a combination of zooids that are in their male and female stages. In all species the [[ovary|ovaries]] develop on the inside of the body wall, and the [[testes]] on the funiculus connecting the stomach to the body wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt; Eggs and sperm are released into the coelom, and sperm exit into the water through pores in the tips of some of the tentacles, and then are captured by the feeding currents of zooids that are producing eggs.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; Some species' eggs are fertilized externally after being released through a pore between two tentacles, which in some cases is at the tip of a small projection called the &quot;intertentacular organ&quot; in the base of a pair of tentacles. Others' are fertilized internally, in the intertentacular organ or in the coelom.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnesBryozoa&quot; /&gt; In ctenostomes the mother provides a brood chamber for the fertilized eggs, and her polypide disintegrates, providing nourishment to the [[embryo]]. Stenolaemates produce specialized zooids to serve as brood chambers, and their eggs divide within this to produce up to 100&amp;nbsp;identical embryos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doherty2001EctoproctaInAnderson&quot; /&gt; 

The [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] of bryozoan eggs is biradial, in other words the early stages are bilaterally symmetrical. It is unknown how the coleom forms, since the [[metamorphosis]] from [[larva]] to adult destroys all of the larva's internal tissues. In many animals the [[blastopore]], an opening in the surface of the early embryo, tunnels through to form the gut.

==Anatomy==
[[Image:Costazia costazi.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[Costazia costazi]]'', a [[coralline]] bryozoan]]
Bryozoan skeletons grow in a variety of shapes and patterns: mound-shaped, lacy fans, branching twigs, and even corkscrew-shaped. Their [[skeleton]]s have numerous tiny openings, each of which is the home of a minute animal called a '''zooid'''. They also have a [[body cavity|coelomate]] body with a looped alimentary canal or gut, opening at the [[mouth]] and terminating at the [[anus]]. They feed with a specialized, [[cilia]]ted structure called a [[lophophore]], which is a crown of [[tentacle]]s surrounding the mouth. Their diet consists of small microorganisms, including [[diatom]]s and other unicellular [[algae]]. In turn, bryozoans are preyed on by grazing organisms such as [[sea urchin]]s and [[fish]]. Bryozoans do not have any defined respiratory, or circulatory systems due to their small size. However, they do have a simple nervous system and a hydrostatic skeletal system. Several studies have been undertaken on the crystallography of bryozoan skeletons, revealing a complex fabric suite of oriented [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]] crystallites within an organic matrix - see for example Hall ''et al.'' (2002).

[[Image:Lophophores bryozoan.jpg|thumb|right240px|bryozoan lophophores]]
The tentacles of the bryozoans are ciliated, and the beating of the [[cilia]] creates a powerful current of water which drives water together with entrained food particles (mainly phytoplankton) towards the mouth. The gut is U-shaped, and consists of a [[pharynx]] which passes into the [[esophagus]], followed by the [[stomach]], which has three parts: the [[cardia]], the [[caecum]], and the [[pylorus]]. The pylorus leads to an intestine and a short [[rectum]] terminating at the anus, which opens outside the [[lophophore]]. In some groups, notably some ctenostomes, a specialized [[gizzard]] may be formed from the proximal part of the cardia. Gut and lophophore are the principal components of the [[polypide]]. Cyclical degeneration and regeneration of the polypide is characteristic of marine bryozoans. After the final polypide degeneration, the skeletal aperture of the feeding zooid may become sealed by the secretion of a terminal [[Septum (marine biology)|diaphragm]]. In many bryozoans only the zooids within a few generations of the growing edge are in an actively feeding state; older, more proximal zooids (e.g. in the interiors of bushy colonies) are usually dormant.

[[File:Freshwater Bryozoan234.JPG|thumb|left|240px|Freshwater bryozoan]]
Because of their small size, bryozoans have no need of a [[blood]] system. Gaseous exchange occurs across the entire surface of the body, but particularly through the tentacles of the lophophore. 

Bryozoans can reproduce both sexually and asexually. All bryozoans, as far as is known, are [[hermaphroditic]] (meaning they are both male and female). [[Asexual reproduction]] occurs by budding off new zooids as the colony grows, and is the main way by which a colony expands in size. If a piece of a bryozoan colony breaks off, the piece can continue to grow and will form a new colony. A colony formed this way is composed entirely of [[Cloning|clones]] (genetically identical individuals) of the first animal, which is called the '''ancestrula'''. 

One species of bryozoan, ''Bugula neritina'', is of current interest as a source of [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] chemicals, [[bryostatin]]s, under clinical investigation as anti-cancer agents.

[[Fossil]] bryozoans are found in rocks beginning in the [[Early Ordovician]] as part of the [[Ordovician radiation]]. They were often major components of Ordovician seabed communities and, like modern-day bryozoans, played an important role in [[sediment]] stabilization and binding, as well as providing sources of food for other [[benthic]] organisms. During the [[Mississippian]] (354 to 323 million years ago) bryozoans were so common that their broken skeletons form entire [[limestone]] beds. Bryozoan fossil record comprises more than 1,000 described species. It is plausible that the Bryozoa existed in the [[Cambrian]] but were soft-bodied or not preserved for some other reason; perhaps they evolved from a [[phoronid]]-like ancestor at about this time.

Bryozoans are important members of sclerobiont (organisms which dwell on hard substrates such as shells and rocks) communities in the fossil record and in the Recent. For a review of sclerobiont evolution, history and ecology, see Taylor &amp; Wilson (2003).

Most fossil bryozoans have mineralized skeletons. The skeletons of individual zooids vary from tubular to box-shaped and contain a terminal aperture from which the [[lophophore]] is protruded to feed. No pores are present in the great majority of Ordovician bryozoans, but skeletal evidence shows that [[epithelia]] were continuous from one zooid to the next.

With regard to the bryozoan groups lacking mineralized skeletons, the [[statoblasts]] of freshwater [[phylactolaemates]] have been recorded as far back as the [[Permian]], and the [[ctenostome]] fossils date from the [[Triassic]].

One of the most important events during bryozoan evolution was the acquisition of a calcareous skeleton and the related change in the mechanism of tentacle protrusion. The rigidity of the outer body walls allowed a greater degree of zooid contiguity and the evolution of massive, multiserial colony forms.

==Classification==
The bryozoans were formerly considered to contain two subgroups: the ''ectoprocta'' and the [[Entoprocta|''entoprocta'']], based on the similar bodyplans and mode of life of these two groups. (Some researchers also included the [[Cycliophora]], which are thought to be closely related to the entoprocta.) However, the ectoprocta are ''coelomate'' (possessing a [[body cavity]]) and their embryos undergo [[radial cleavage]], while the entoprocta are ''acoelemate'' and undergo [[spiral cleavage]]. Molecular studies are ambiguous about the exact position of the entoprocta, but do not support a close relationship with the ectoprocta. For these reasons, the entoprocta are now considered a phylum of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = James W. Valentine|title = On the origins of phyla |year = 2004|publisher = University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of the 150 species of entoprocta leaves ''bryozoa'' synonymous with ''ectoprocta''; some authors have adopted the latter name for the group, but the majority continue to use the former.

The closest relations of the bryozoans appear to be the [[brachiopod]]s. The sister group to this clade is still unclear but this seems most likely to be the [[phoronid]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Parsley Curled.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Parsley]] is an example of a biennial plant.]]

A '''biennial plant''' is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its biological lifecycle. In the first year the plant grows leaves, stems, and roots (vegetative structures), then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months. Usually the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground, forming a rosette.  Many biennials require a cold treatment, or [[vernalization]], before they will flower. During the next spring or summer, the stem of the biennial plant elongates greatly, or &quot;bolts.&quot;  The plant then flowers, producing fruits and [[seed]]s before it finally dies. There are far fewer biennials than either [[perennial plants]] or [[annual plants]].

Under extreme climatic conditions, a biennial plant may complete its life cycle in a very short period of time (e.g. three or four months instead of two years). This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were exposed to cold conditions, or vernalized, before they were planted in the ground. This behavior leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as [[annual plant|annuals]] in some areas.  Flowering can be induced in some biennials without vernalization by application of the [[plant hormone]] ''[[gibberellin]]'', but this is rarely done commercially.

[[Image:Spring Flowers.JPG|thumb|The Sweet William Dwarf plant is a biennial plant&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://davesgarden.com/pf/go/190/|title=Detailed Information on Sweet William Dianthus barbatus|publisher=Dave's Garden}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]From a gardener's perspective, a plant's status as [[annual plant|annual]], biennial, or [[perennial plant|perennial]] often varies based on location or purpose. Biennials grown for flowers, fruits, or seeds need to be grown for two years. Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown as annuals, e.g. [[beet]]s, [[Brussels sprouts]], [[cabbage]], [[carrot]]s, [[celery]], [[lettuce]], [[parsley]], and [[Swiss chard]]. If a normally biennial plant is grown in extremely harsh conditions, it is likely to be treated as an annual because it will not survive the winter cold. Conversely, an annual grown under extremely favorable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation, giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial. Some short-lived perennials may appear to be biennial rather than perennial. True biennials flower only once, while many perennials will flower every year once mature.

Examples of biennial plants are [[parsley]], ''[[Lunaria]]'', [[silverbeet]], [[Sweet William]], [[colic weed]], and [[carrot]].  Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed, e.g. [[foxglove]] and [[Matthiola incana|stock]].

'''Bay leaf''' (plural '''bay leaves''') refers to the aromatic leaf of the [[bay laurel]] (''Laurus nobilis'', Lauraceae). Fresh or dried bay leaves are used in cooking for their distinctive flavor and fragrance. The leaves are often used to flavor soups, stews, braises and pâtés in Mediterranean cuisine. The fresh leaves are very mild and do not develop their full flavor until several weeks after picking and drying.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spice Trade: Bay Leaf&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spice-trade.com/bay-leaf.html | title = Spice Trade: Bay Leaf | accessdate = 2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The term &quot;bay leaf&quot; is used to refer to several other plants besides the leaves of ''L. nobilis''. These include:
*California bay leaf - the leaf of the California bay tree (''[[Umbellularia californica]]''), also known as California laurel, Oregon myrtle, and pepperwood, is similar to the Mediterranean bay, but has a stronger flavor.
*[[Malabathrum|Indian bay leaf]] (also ''tej pat'', ''tejpat'', ''tejpata'' तेजपत्ता or ''Tamalpatra'' तमालपत्र or ''Biryani aaku'' or ''Bagaara aaku'' or ''Palav aaku'' in Telugu or ''Punnai ilai'' in Tamil or ''Daalchini'' ದಾಲ್ಚೀನಿ in Kannada)
*Indonesian bay leaf or Indonesian laurel (''salam'' leaf) - the leaf of ''Syzygium polyanthum'' is not commonly found outside of Indonesia; this herb is applied to meat and, less often vegetables. Like Indian bay leaf, it is also inaccurately named because the plant is actually a member of the [[Myrtaceae]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/engl/Euge_pol.html | title =Spice Pages: Indonesian Bay-Leaf | accessdate = 2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In appearance, the leaf of the ''Cinnamomum tejpata'' ([[malabathrum]]) tree is similar to the other bay leaves, but is culinarily quite different, having a fragrance and taste similar to [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cinnamon (cassia)]] bark, but milder. In culinary terms, it is misleading to call it bay leaf because it is of a genus other than that of the bay laurel tree, it does not taste the same as the bay laurel leaf, and cannot be used in cooking as a substitute for the bay laurel leaf.

== History ==
The bay laurel tree has been cultivated since the beginning of recorded history;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chow.com/ingredients/77 | title =Bay Leaf and california bay leaf | accessdate = 2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; it originated in Asia Minor, and spread to the Mediterranean and other countries with suitable climates. Bay leaf is not grown in northern regions, as the plants do not thrive in cold climates. Turkey is one of the main exporters of bay leaves, although they are also grown in areas of [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[Colombia]], [[Central America]], [[North America]], and [[India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spice Trade: Bay Leaf&quot; /&gt; The laurel tree from which the bay leaf comes was very important both symbolically and literally in both Greece and Rome. The laurel can be found as a central component found in many ancient mythologies that glorify the tree as a symbol of honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Spices: Bay Leaf&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theepicentre.com/Spices/bay.html | title =Encyclopedia of Spices: Bay Leaf | accessdate = 2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bay leaves are one of the most widely used culinary herbs in Europe and North America. 
In the Elizabethan era, some people believed pinning bay leaves to one's pillow on the eve of Saint Valentines day would permit one to see one's future spouse in a dream.

== Taste and aroma ==
If eaten whole, bay leaves are pungent and have a sharp, bitter taste. As with many spices and flavorings, the fragrance of the bay leaf is more noticeable than its taste. When dried, the fragrance is herbal, slightly floral, and somewhat similar to [[oregano]] and [[thyme]]. [[Myrcene]], which is a component of many essential oils used in perfumery, can be extracted from the bay leaf. Bay leaves also contain the [[essential oil]] [[eugenol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Spices: Bay Leaf&quot; /&gt;

==Uses==

Bay leaves are a fixture in the cooking of many European cuisines (particularly those of the Mediterranean), as well as in North America. They are used in soups, stews, meat, seafood and vegetable dishes. The leaves also flavor many classic French dishes. The leaves are most often used whole (sometimes in a ''[[bouquet garni]]'') and removed before serving (they can be abrasive in the digestive tract). In Indian ([[Sanskrit]] name ''Tamaalpatra'', Hindi ''Tejpatta'') and Pakistani cuisine, bay leaves are often used in ''[[biryani]]'' and other rich spicy dishes - although not as an everyday ingredient in home cuisine - and as an ingredient in ''[[garam masala]]''. 

Bay leaves can also be crushed or ground before cooking. Crushed bay leaves impart more of their desired fragrance than whole leaves, but are more difficult to remove, and thus they are often used in a muslin bag or tea infuser.  Ground bay laurel may be substituted for whole leaves, and does not need to be removed, but it is much stronger due to the increased surface area and in some dishes the texture may not be desirable. 

Bay leaves can also be scattered in a [[pantry]] to repel [[meal moth]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.care2.com/greenliving/repel-grain-moths-with-bay-leaves.html | title =How to Repel Grain Moths with Bay Leaves | accessdate = 2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; flies and roaches.

==Medicinal value==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}
In the [[Middle Ages]], bay leaves were believed to induce [[abortions]] and to have many [[magical]] qualities. They were once used to keep moths away, owing to the leaf's [[lauric acid]] content that gives it [[Insecticide|insecticidal]] properties. Bay leaves have many properties that make them useful for treating high blood sugar, migraine headaches, [[Pathogenic bacteria|bacterial]] and [[fungal infections]], and [[gastric ulcers]]. Bay leaves and berries have been used for their [[astringent]], [[carminative]], [[diaphoretic]], [[digestive]], [[diuretic]], [[emetic]] and [[stomachic]] properties. Bay oil, or oil of bays (''oleum lauri'') is used in [[liniments]] for bruises and sprains. Bay leaf has been used as an herbal remedy for headaches. It contains compounds, called [[parthenolide]]s, which have proven useful in the treatment of migraines. Bay leaf has also been shown to help the body process [[insulin]] more efficiently, which leads to lower blood sugar levels. It has also been used to reduce the effects of stomach ulcers. Bay leaf contains [[eugenol]], which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Bay leaf is also an [[antifungal]] and [[antibacterial]], and has also been used to treat [[rheumatism]], [[amenorrhea]], and [[colic]].

== Safety ==
Some members of the laurel family, as well as the unrelated, but visually similar [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] and [[Prunus laurocerasus|cherry laurel]], have leaves that are poisonous to humans and livestock. While these plants are not sold anywhere for culinary use, their visual similarity to bay leaves has led to the oft-repeated belief bay leaves should be removed from food after cooking because they are poisonous. This is not true - bay leaves may be eaten without toxic effect. However, they remain very stiff even after thorough cooking, and if swallowed whole or in large pieces, they may pose a risk of scratching the digestive tract or even causing choking. Thus, most recipes that use bay leaves will recommend their removal after the cooking process has finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2695/what-is-the-origin-of-the-song-theres-a-place-in-france-where-the-naked-ladies-dance | title =Straight Dope: Are Bay Leaves Poisonous? | accessdate = 2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultivation ==
Gardeners in frost-free or light frost areas will find that bay laurel seedlings planted in the ground easily grow into large trees, {{convert|38|ft|m}} and taller; but when kept pruned, it can thrive as a small bush.  Bay laurel can also be grown in containers, the size of which limits the ultimate size of the trees.  New plants are often started via [[layering]], or from [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]], since growing from seed can be difficult.

Bay trees are difficult to start from seed, due in part to the seed's low germination rate, and long germination period.  Fresh seeds with the [[pericarp]] removed typically have a 40% germination rate, while dried seeds and/or seeds with an intact pericarp have yet lower germination rates.  In addition, the seed germination period can be 50 days or more, which increases the risk of the seeds rotting before they germinate.  Treating the seeds with [[gibberellic acid]] can be useful in increasing seed germination, as is careful monitoring of moisture levels in the rooting medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/kh684u8757716q57/ | title =SpringerLink: Seed dormancy in bay laurel | accessdate = 2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and significance==
{{Main|History of the Burgess Shale}}
[[Image:ROM-BurgessShale-CompleteAnomalocarisFossil.png|thumb|left|The first complete ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' fossil found.]]

The Burgess Shale was discovered by [[palaeontologist]] [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]] in 1909, towards the end of the season's fieldwork.{{fotbs}} He returned in 1910 with his sons, daughter, and wife, establishing a quarry on the flanks of Fossil Ridge. The significance of soft-bodied preservation, and the range of organisms he recognised as new to science, led him to return to the quarry almost every year until 1924. At this point, aged 74, he had amassed over 65,000 specimens. Describing the fossils was a vast task, pursued by Walcott until his death in 1927.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; Walcott, led by scientific opinion at the time, attempted to categorise all fossils into living taxa, and as a result, the fossils were regarded as little more than curiosities at the time. It was not until 1962 that a first-hand reinvestigation of the fossils was attempted, by Alberto Simonetta. This led scientists to recognise that Walcott had barely scratched the surface of information available in the Burgess Shale, and also made it clear that the organisms did not fit comfortably into modern groups.

Excavations were resumed at the [[Walcott Quarry]] by the Geological Survey of Canada under the persuasion of [[trilobite]] expert [[Harry Blackmore Whittington]], and a new quarry, the Raymond, was established about 20 metres higher up Fossil Ridge.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; Whittington, with the help of research students [[Derek Briggs]] and [[Simon Conway Morris]] of the [[University of Cambridge]], began a thorough reassessment of the Burgess Shale, and revealed that the fauna represented were much more diverse and unusual than Walcott had recognized.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; Indeed, many of the animals present had [[body form|bizarre anatomical features]] and only the slightest resemblance to other known animals. Examples include ''[[Opabinia]]'', with five eyes and a snout like a vacuum cleaner hose; ''[[Nectocaris]]'', which resembles either a [[crustacean]] with fins or a [[vertebrate]] with a shell; and ''[[Hallucigenia]]'', which was originally reconstructed upside down, walking on bilaterally symmetrical spines.

With [[Parks Canada]] and [[UNESCO]] recognising the significance of the Burgess Shale, collecting fossils became politically more difficult from the mid-1970s. Collections continued to be made by the [[Royal Ontario Museum]]. The curator of invertebrate palaeontology, [[Desmond Collins]], identified a number of additional outcrops, stratigraphically both higher and lower than the original Walcott quarry.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; These localities continue to yield new organisms faster than they can be studied.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s book ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'', published in 1989, brought the Burgess Shale fossils to the public's attention. Gould suggests that the extraordinary diversity of the fossils indicate that life forms at the time were much more diverse than those that survive today, and that many of the unique lineages were evolutionary experiments that became extinct. Gould's interpretation of the diversity of Cambrian fauna relied heavily on Simon Conway Morris' reinterpretation of Charles Walcott's original publications. However, Conway Morris strongly disagreed with Gould's conclusions, arguing that almost all the Cambrian fauna could be classified into modern day phyla.&lt;ref&gt;''The Crucible of Creation: The Burgess Shale and the Rise of Animals'' , Simon Conway Morris&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geological setting==
{{Main|Stephen Formation}}
[[Image:Burgess Shale, Yoho National Park of Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Satellite]] image of the area.]]

The fossiliferous deposits of the Burgess Shale correlate to the Stephen formation, a collection of slightly calcareous dark mudstones, about {{Ma|burgess shale|million years}} old.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; The beds were deposited at the base of a cliff about 160&amp;nbsp;m tall,&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; below the depth agitated by waves during storms.&lt;ref name=Gabbott2008&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This vertical cliff was composed of the calcareous reefs of the [[Cathedral Formation]], which probably formed shortly before the deposition of the Burgess Shale.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; The precise formation mechanism is not known for certain, but the most widely accepted hypothesis suggests that the edge of the Cathedral Formation reef became detached from the rest of the reef, slumping and being transported some distance — perhaps kilometers — away from the reef edge.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; Later reactivation of faults at the base of the formation led to its disintegration from about {{Ma|509}}.&lt;ref name='Collom2009'&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.02.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have left a steep cliff, the bottom of which would be protected, because the limestone of the Cathedral Formation is difficult to compress, from tectonic decompression. This protection explains why fossils preserved further from the Cathedral Formation are impossible to work with — tectonic squeezing of the beds has produced a vertical cleavage that fractures the rocks, so they split perpendicular to the fossils.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; The Walcott quarry produced such spectacular fossils because it was so close to the Stephen Formation — indeed the quarry has now been excavated to the very edge of the Cambrian cliff.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt;

It was originally thought that the Burgess Shale was deposited in anoxic conditions, but mounting research shows that oxygen was continually present in the sediment.&lt;ref name=Powell2009&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.02.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anoxic setting had been thought to not only protect the newly dead organisms from decay, but it also created chemical conditions allowing the preservation of the soft parts of the organisms. Further, it reduced the abundance of burrowing organisms — burrows and trackways ''are'' found in beds containing soft-bodied organisms, but they are rare and generally of limited vertical extent.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; Brine seeps are an alternative hypothesis - see [[Burgess Shale type preservation]] for a more thorough discussion.

There are many other comparable Cambrian ''[[lagerstätte]]n''; indeed such assemblages are far more common in the Cambrian than in any other period. This is mainly due to the limited extent of burrowing activity; as such [[bioturbation]] [[Cambrian substrate revolution|became more prevalent]] throughout the Cambrian, environments capable of preserving organisms' soft parts became much rarer.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; (The [[pre-Cambrian]] fossil record of animals is sparse and ambiguous.)

==Biota==
{{Main|Fossils of the Burgess Shale|Burgess Shale type fauna}}

The biota of the Burgess Shale appears to be typical of Middle Cambrian deposits.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; Although the hard-part bearing organisms make up as little as 14% of the community,&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; these same organisms are found in similar proportions in other Cambrian localities. This means that there is no reason to assume that the organisms without hard parts are exceptional in any way; indeed, many appear in other lagerstätten of different age and locations.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt;

The biota consists of a range of organisms. Free-swimming ({{wict|nectonic}}) organisms are relatively rare, with the majority of organisms being bottom dwelling (benthic) — either moving about (vagrant) or permanently attached to the sea floor (sessile).&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt; About two-thirds of the Burgess Shale organisms lived by feeding on the organic content in the muddy sea floor, while almost a third filtered out fine particles from the water column. Under 10% of organisms were predators or scavengers, although since these organisms were larger, the biomass was split equally between each of the filter feeding, deposit feeding, predatory and scavenging organisms.&lt;ref name=fotbs/&gt;

== Working with the Burgess Shale ==

The fossils of the Burgess Shale are preserved as black carbon films on black shales, and so are difficult to photograph; however, various photographic techniques can improve the quality of the images that can be acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bengtson|first=Stefan|title=Teasing Fossils out of Shales with Cameras and Computers|journal=Palaeontologia Electronica|year=2000|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://palaeo-electronica.org/2000_1/fossils/text.pdf|accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other techniques include backscatter SEM, elemental mapping and ''[[camera lucida]]'' drawing.

Once images have been acquired, the effects of decay and taphonomy must be accounted for before a correct anatomical reconstruction can be made. A consideration of the combination of characters allows researchers to establish the taxonomic affinity.

'''''Beavis and Butt-head''''' is an American [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] created by [[Mike Judge]]. Judge's 1992 short film ''[[Frog Baseball (Beavis and Butt-head)|Frog Baseball]]'' was the first appearance of Beavis and Butt-head and [[cable channel]] [[MTV]] signed Judge to turn the concept into a series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= MTV Toon Dudes Are Slow on Two Counts Television: The amiably dim Beavis and Butt-Head are already a hit with the network's audience, but they're taking a break while the animators catch up. |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-16/entertainment/ca-664_1_animation-festival|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Butt-head, We Hardly Knew Ye|last= Rosenberg|first= Howard|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1997-11-26|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/26/entertainment/ca-57733|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beavis and Butt-head'' aired from March 8, 1993, to November 28, 1997. The series has retained a cult following and is rated [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-14|TV-14]] when reruns are aired in the United States.

The show centers on two socially inept [[rock music|rock]]/[[heavy metal music|metal]]-loving teenage boys, [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-head]] (both voiced by Judge), who live in the town of Highland, Texas. They seem to have no adult supervision at home, are woefully undereducated, and seem quite dim-witted. Although they are teenagers, they are young enough that they are barely through [[puberty]]. They attend high school, where their teachers are often at a loss as to how to deal with them, although in many episodes the two skip school altogether. They occasionally work part-time at Burger World and sometimes other side-jobs when people mistake their odd behavior as outgoing and assertive. Their recreational activities (besides watching television) range from chasing women to [[skeet shooting]]. They have little remorse for their actions, such as when Butt-head misfired a rifle, hitting a [[Boeing 747]] (which had a number of pregnant women inside) and Butt-Head simply nudging Beavis with his shoulder and saying &quot;Did you hear that Beavis? There's a chick on that plane who scored.&quot;

The comedic value is partly based on the pair's lack of conventional values: they are highly obnoxious, perverted, and rude to almost every other character in the show, including each other. However, they do not realize this and seem to function on an instinctual level. They survive their often hazardous misadventures without serious consequences, though others around them do not fare as well. Mixed within each episode are segments in which Beavis and Butt-head watch [[music video]]s and provide commentary improvised by Judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Goodbye, cool world TV: Beavis and Butt-head, nasty, dumb, hysterical little boogers, are going off the air.

In 1996, the series was adapted into the animated feature film ''[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]''. On July 14, 2010, it was announced that the series would be revived and begin airing on MTV with new episodes to begin airing sometime during summer 2011. The series is expected to keep its animation style, and to keep Beavis and Butt-Head the same age as they were during the show's original run.&lt;ref name=&quot;revival&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/they_re_back_PZVN8lcKHQYVIYx3xAJRtM |title=They're back! |publisher=New York Post |last=Starr |first=Michael |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
===Main characters===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Character !!Description
|-
| &lt;center&gt;[[Beavis]]&lt;/center&gt;
|Voiced by [[Mike Judge]]. Has an [[Prognathism|underbite]] and a fixated stare on his face, which is almost always shown in profile. Beavis grunts when he laughs, has a more guttural voice and has a penchant for picking his nose. He is the more excitable of the two and though he is oblivious to what should be obvious he is also prone to moments of insight (another source of humor) and is nicer and more optimistic than Butt-head. He often suffers physically in the show, either by Butt-head or various other characters or situations. He usually takes the beating and screams in pain before quickly reverting to his trademark laugh. Before controversy erupted (see below) he exhibited [[pyromania|an obsession with fire]] and his trademark phrase was &quot;FIRE! FIRE!&quot; which he would render with a maniacal gaze in his eye. One episode showed that he has voices in his head telling him to engage in destructive activities; however, generally he has a passive demeanor in contrast to Butt-head's more dominant personality. Beavis also originally wears a Metallica shirt with grey shorts.  When Beavis consumes large amounts of [[caffeine]] or sugar products, he transforms into his hyperactive [[alter-ego]], Cornholio.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;[[Butt-head]]&lt;/center&gt;
| Voiced by [[Mike Judge]]. Wears [[dental braces]] has squinty eyes and a drooping nose with prominent nostrils. His top gums are often exposed due to a small upper lip and he speaks nasally with a deep voice and a slight lisp. He begins almost every statement with &quot;Uhhhhhh...&quot; and ends with his short trademark laugh &quot;Uh huh huh huh&quot;. Calmer, though cockier, and marginally more intelligent than Beavis, Butt-head is oblivious to subtlety of any sort and is usually 100% confident in everything he says and does no matter how ridiculous or frivolous it is—unless it has to do with females, in which case he either wavers or comes on too strongly. His trademark phrase when approaching women is &quot;hey baby&quot;. As the more dominant personality of the duo it seems he derives pleasure from regularly abusing Beavis. Butt-head also originally wears an AC/DC shirt with red shorts. 

Creator Mike Judge has stated he got the idea for the name &quot;Butt-head&quot; from two people he knew during his childhood called &quot;Iron Butt&quot; (who would encourage people to kick him in the butt to demonstrate his strength) and &quot;Butt-head&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.inthe80s.com/july1995/animate/beavis.html | title=Mike Judge Interviewed by John Kricfalusi | publisher =[[Wild Cartoon Kingdom]] | year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Voiced by [[Mike Judge]]. The [[myopia|nearsighted]], elderly neighbor of Beavis and Butt-head. He often hires them to do chores which results in them destroying his yard, home, or personal belongings. Due to his poor eyesight and mild [[senility]] he never seems to recognize the two and he never remembers their names (in one episode the two wore [[horn rimmed glasses]] in an absurd disguise which Anderson did not notice). He served in the Navy during [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. His character is a big influence on the look and voice of the character [[Hank Hill]] from Judge's subsequent series, ''[[King of the Hill]]'' as both were based on the same person from Judge's youth.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;David Van Driessen&lt;/center&gt;
| Voiced by [[Mike Judge]]. A teacher at Highland High School and arguably the only person who cares about Beavis and Butt-head. Van Driessen is a devoted [[hippie]] with a forgiving nature and gentle demeanor. His repeated attempts to teach the duo useful life lessons typically end in disaster as they almost always deduce the wrong message. He often plays songs on his [[acoustic guitar]] which typically end in him being severely hurt and in some cases almost killed. He has been shown teaching classes on [[biology]], [[art]], [[animation]], [[economics]], [[health]], [[history]], and [[literature]], among others. He also owns a substantial [[8-track tape]] collection, which is ruined in one episode by Beavis and Butt-head. His voice and personality are similar to and may serve as a basis of sort for the character of Gerald Goode in Judge's latest animated series ''[[The Goode Family]]''. He was probably a base of the character &quot;Mr. Mackey&quot; from ''[[South Park]]'', Due to his &quot;Mmkay&quot;s, and he's always trying to bring peace to people (as Mr. Mackey is a Counselor).
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Coach Bradley Buzzcut&lt;/center&gt;
| Voiced by [[Mike Judge]]. Another of the duo's high school teachers and the antithesis of Van Driessen. Angry, impatient and short-tempered Buzzcut is a [[Vietnam War]] veteran who served in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and, with the possible exception of Principal McVicker, hates the duo more than any other character. He is shown substitute teaching regular classes but usually teaches [[physical education]]. It has been implied that he has on occasion committed [[assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]] against the duo.

He does occasionally protect Beavis and Butt-head. He once defended them from an angry guest lecturer (Mr. Candy, previously known as Mr. Manners) by saying &quot;This is my class. I do the ass kicking around here!&quot; In another episode, he saves Butt-head by performing CPR.  It is possible that he only does so out of a sense of professional obligation.  
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Principal McVicker&lt;/center&gt;
| Voiced by [[Mike Judge]]. [[Principal (education)|Principal]] of Highland High; hates the duo. The two have unintentionally ruined his life. Many episodes begin with Beavis and Butt-head in his office. They refer to him as &quot;McDicker.&quot; He is constantly stressed out due to having to deal with Beavis and Butt-head: he shakes when he speaks, he is frequently rummaging through his desk for prescription medications and [[Maalox]], and in one early episode he is shown guzzling a bottle of [[Old Crow]]. In one episode, when he thought that Beavis and Butt-head were dead, he immediately stopped shaking and became much calmer and more cheerful. It is currently unknown if McVicker will return to the series since he suffered a heart attack and may have died at the end of the original series finale &quot;Beavis and Butt-head Are Dead&quot;.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;[[Daria Morgendorffer]]&lt;/center&gt;
| Voiced by [[Tracy Grandstaff]]. Daria is a [[sarcasm|sarcastic]], vaguely [[Alternative rock|alt-rock]]erish, nerdy girl who attends Highland High with Beavis and Butt-head and she is one of the few people who sees the two for what they truly are. While not above taking jabs at them for their lack of intelligence, she also offers occasional help and advice. The duo nicknamed her &quot;[[Diarrhea]]&quot; but once said she was cool after she asked President Clinton a poignant question during a school assembly. Indeed, she is one of the few characters they respect at all. She eventually went on to star in her own spin-off series, ''[[Daria]]''. It is unknown if she will return to the series since it could take place after she moves out of Highland.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Todd Ianuzzi&lt;/center&gt;
| Voiced by [[Rottilio Michieli]]. Todd is a trashy deadbeat and violent criminal. Although Beavis and Butt-head greatly admire him and aspire to join his &quot;[[gang]]&quot;, Todd despises the two and frequently beats them up and takes advantage of them when he needs something, such as [[money]], or a place to hide from other gangs or the [[police]]. In the episode &quot;Steamroller&quot; it is said that Todd had dropped out of school two years before. Even though Todd's last name &quot;Ianuzzi&quot; was never revealed in the series, it was revealed to be &quot;Ianuzzi&quot; in ''[[This Book Sucks]]''.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;Stewart Stevenson&lt;/center&gt;
| Voiced by Adam Welsh. A nerdy, wimpy, short kid who admires Beavis and Butt-head and mistakenly believes they are his best friends. Beavis and Butt-head relate to him mostly as Todd relates to them. They bully Stewart and regularly take advantage of his attempts to befriend them usually resulting in Stewart getting in trouble with his parents for something actually done by Beavis and Butt-head. Stewart wears a [[Winger_(band)#Criticism|Winger]] t-shirt as a not-so-subtle reinforcement of his wimpiness (as opposed to the &quot;coolness&quot; of Beavis and Butt-head wearing Metallica and AC/DC t-shirts).

===Minor characters===
{{Main|List of minor characters in Beavis and Butt-Head}}

==Holiday specials==
Four holiday specials were produced—one for [[Halloween]], two for [[Christmas]] and one for [[Thanksgiving]].
*The Halloween special, entitled &quot;[[List of Beavis and Butt-head episodes#Season 6: 1995-1996|Bungholio: Lord of the Harvest (Butt-O-Ween)]]&quot;, involved them attempting to [[Trick-or-treating|trick-or-treat]] in ridiculous [[costume]]s--i.e. Beavis dressed up as a giant [[testicle|nad]] by wearing underpants on his head and Butt-head becoming [[nachos]] by pouring hot cheese-sauce over his head, although at one point he said he was dressed up as a dumbass. When Beavis eats all of Tom Anderson's candy, his Cornholio persona emerges and embarks on a rampage to acquire more from other trick-or-treaters, while Butt-head is taken on a &quot;ride&quot; to the countryside in Todd's trunk, where he encounters a strangely pale old farmer. When Beavis finally comes down from his sugar high, he is hanging on a meathook in the farmer's barn, where the old man and a similarly pale Butt-head seemingly attack him with chainsaws as the episode fades to blood red.
*The first Christmas special featured the pair sitting in front of the television providing crude commentary on various aspects of Christmas, and commenting on Christmas-themed music videos from various artists.
*The second Christmas special was simply entitled &quot;[[List of Beavis and Butt-head episodes#Season 6: 1995-1996|''Beavis and Butt-head'' Christmas Special]]&quot;, or alternately &quot;Beavis and Butt-head Do Christmas&quot;. It consisted of two segments that [[parody|parodied]] ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' directed by Tony Kluck and ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' directed by former [[DreamWorks Animation]] director Mike deSeve, as well as Christmas-themed [[music video]]s (taken from the first Christmas special) and several segments in which Butt-head answered [[fan mail]] dressed as [[Santa Claus]] while whipping a [[reindeer]]-costumed Beavis.
*The MTV Thanksgiving Special &quot;Beavis and Butt-head Do Thanksgiving&quot; aired on November 27, 1997, the day before the series finale ''Beavis and Butt-head Are Dead'' written by Andy Rheingold and Scott Sonneborn The bit featured [[Kurt Loder]] as the show's host, half-reluctantly and half-resigned, trying to teach the two characters the meaning of Thanksgiving as they report live from the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in New York City, where they take more interest in people's butts and porn-shops than anything else. Among others, the special featured appearances by [[Adam Sandler]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Jay-Z]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], [[Tori Amos]], and the [[Beastie Boys]]. Also featured were two music videos (&quot;Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot; by Marilyn Manson and &quot;Criminal&quot; by Fiona Apple) not included in any of the show's regular episodes. The Thanksgiving special only aired once, and its inclusion in the Mike Judge Collection [[DVD]] set shows it in a heavily edited format without the music videos or the celebrity appearances.

==Critiques of music videos==
One of the most well-known aspects of the series was the inclusion of music videos, which occurred between animated segments. The duo would watch and make humorous observations (about the band, a song's lyrics, and/or a video's visuals), or simply engage in nonsensical dialogs. Mike Judge improvised the video comments, and they were never scripted. Almost all the animations of Beavis and Butt-Head during the videos were re-used from earlier episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot; /&gt;
At times, the criticism reflected their young age and ignorance of music history. Upon seeing a video for &quot;Iron Man&quot; by [[Black Sabbath]], they decided that the band's vocalist couldn't be [[Ozzy Osbourne]], because &quot;Ozzy's an old fart!&quot; Butt-Head said &quot;That's not Ozzy--that's his son!&quot; Beavis mistook their raw sound for [[grunge]] and inquired if they were from [[Seattle]]; Butt-head replied &quot;No, they're American,&quot;  even though Black Sabbath's members were from England. During one episode, Butt-head remarked, &quot;You know those asswipes [[The Beatles]]? Those guys ruined music.&quot; Similarly, the pair described [[Paul Simon]] as &quot;that old dude from Africa who used to be in the Beatles,&quot; and Butt-head once observed of Frank Sinatra, &quot;I think he used to be in the Eagles.&quot; However, at other times they seemed almost respectful and willing to learn about music.
	
When confronted with a song/video they did not like, they usually watched it anyway, commenting on how bad it was and how much it sucked. However, if they could not stand it, their solution was to change the channel. Most of the time, they came across a better video, but there have been instances where they found a video they perceived as worse than the previous one. One particularly memorable moment was when they were watching [[Frank Zappa]]'s video, &quot;[[You Are What You Is]]&quot;, and changed the channel during the video to come across [[The Europeans (band)|The Europeans]]' &quot;The Animal Song&quot; video, which they perceived as even worse. Eventually, they forgot why they were watching it, and changed back to the Frank Zappa video, much to their chagrin (&quot;This is still on? That pisses me off!&quot;).
	
They showed a particular disdain for many generic 1980s &quot;[[glam metal|hair bands]]&quot;. They had almost no tolerance for [[New Wave music|new wave]] or [[electronic music]] (e.g. &quot;[[Two Tribes]]&quot;, &quot;[[Cars (song)|Cars]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Scatman (Ski Ba Bop Ba Dop Bop)|Scatman]]&quot; were all instantly shown contempt by the duo). [[Korn]]'s song &quot;[[Blind (Korn song)|Blind]]&quot;, as an example of [[Nu metal]], was criticized for lacking originality (although they did claim they sounded &quot;kinda cool&quot;). Bands who received considerably large amounts of criticism during the tenure of the show included [[Poison (band)|Poison]] and [[Grim Reaper (band)|Grim Reaper]].
	
[[File:Beavis and Butthead horror.png|thumb|right|Their reaction to Milli Vanilli]]

Beavis and Butt-head had especially severe reactions when confronted with videos they found particularly awful. As soon as Butt-head realized he was watching a [[Michael Bolton]] video, he announced that he had [[Fecal incontinence|soiled]] his pants, although he later stated he was joking. The duo then commented on how he can &quot;make any kind of music suck&quot;. Sometimes, while giving a harsh review for a video, the duo would give a review to another band or musician despite the video not belonging to them; this was the case for [[Ace of Base]] while the boys were watching &quot;Here We Go&quot; by [[Johan Renck|Stakka Bo]]. When confronted with [[Milli Vanilli]]'s &quot;[[Baby Don't Forget My Number]]&quot; and [[Vanilla Ice]]'s &quot;[[Ice Ice Baby]]&quot;, the pair looked at one another in horror and changed the channel without speaking a word; this was effectively among the harshest commentary they ever gave a music video. [[The Europeans (band)|The Europeans]]' video for &quot;The Animal Song&quot; was the most critically trashed by the duo, as Butt-head claimed, &quot;This sucks more than anything I have ever seen.&quot;
	
Even bands they ''liked'' were not spared. They were disappointed by an AC/DC video despite being fans of the group. Also, during a [[Metallica]] video, Butt-head comments, telling [[Lars Ulrich]], &quot;Sit your ass down, Lars, and play drums like you're supposed to!&quot; and by saying that [[James Hetfield]] resembled the [[Cowardly Lion]]. [[Judas Priest]]'s video for &quot;[[Breaking the Law]]&quot; also drew a negative reaction due to the low quality of the video (Butt-head simply stated, &quot;I like Priest and everything, but this sucks!&quot;). They would sometimes insult one part of a video, and praise another. This would often happen with songs with both quiet and loud parts, such as [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]]'s &quot;[[Danzig III: How the Gods Kill|How the Gods Kill]]&quot;, Metallica's &quot;[[One (Metallica song)|One]]&quot;, and [[Radiohead]]'s &quot;[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]&quot;.

Beavis and Butt-head also shared a disdainful dislike of many bands from England; while watching a [[Pink Floyd]] video, Butt-head claimed that they were &quot;Just another gang of wussies from England.&quot; Then Beavis claims that he would really like to go to England, explaining that, &quot;Since everyone in England's a wuss, I could go around kicking everybody's ass and then I would be the only person that's not a wussy there&quot;. Other bands, such as [[The Shamen]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]], were mocked for their British accents. The duo also made fun of performers who were [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] or [[Androgyny|androgynous]] (such as [[Boy George]] or [[Marilyn Manson]]) and often evinced disgust or fear towards notions of male [[homosexuality]] (e.g. Butt-head would quip &quot;he's smiling at you&quot; which would result in an angry retort from Beavis).

Beavis and Butt-head rarely expressed complete enjoyment of any video; but a few bands did draw more favorable attention from the two than others. Their preference was heavy metal and 90's hard rock, such as [[Pantera]], [[Alice in Chains]] and [[White Zombie]]. They also had a deep admiration for [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and sang &quot;[[Iron Man (song)|Iron Man]]&quot; when they were excited about something or to celebrate. [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s [[Kurt Cobain]] is said to have been ecstatic at having the video for &quot;[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]&quot; praised by Beavis and Butt-head, and deemed it a great compliment. [[Gwar|GWAR]] were among the most highly reviewed bands by the duo, with Beavis once proclaiming that &quot;every video should be like a GWAR video.&quot; Beavis and Butt-head lauded [[Bananarama]]'s video for [[Venus (Shocking Blue song)|Venus]], saying &quot;these chicks should marry GWAR&quot; and that &quot;they would have offspring that would be the coolest people who ever lived.&quot; Butt-head once complimented [[Lou Reed]] after watching the video for &quot;No Money Down&quot; (dubbed &quot;the coolest of all videos&quot; by the boys) by stating that Lou belonged in GWAR. The crass uber-metal video, &quot;The Damned&quot; by [[Wendy O. Williams]] and [[Plasmatics|The Plasmatics]] received obvious praise from the duo since it featured all the themes of their interest (loud metal music, a semi-naked woman, destruction and explosions). One of the most unexpected positive reviews they ever gave was for &quot;[[Jive Talkin']]&quot; by the [[Bee Gees]], which they mistook for the Black Crowes (in the end, they realized they were not the Black Crowes, but danced to the song anyway). Hard rock band [[Guns N' Roses]] have also been praised by the duo, during their song &quot;Paradise City&quot;, proclaiming &quot;These guys kick butt&quot;, as well as headbanging to the songs solo. [[Motörhead]] was also held in high regard, but they only seemed to compliment [[Lemmy]]. On a [[Ramones]] video where Lemmy makes an appearance, Beavis asked what Lemmy was doing there and Butt-head responded by saying, &quot;He's Lemmy, dumbass. He can go into any damn video he wants.&quot;

Despite heavy metal and hard rock being their favorite forms of music, Beavis and Butt-head had a fondness for [[hip hop]], especially [[gangsta rap]]. Rap groups and performers such as [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[Run-D.M.C.]], [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]] and [[Dr. Dre]] received positive responses from the boys. This can be noted with Beavis's occasional mimicking of &quot;gangsta&quot; jargon. One of their oddest reviews was that of [[Blues Explosion|The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion]]'s video for &quot;Dang&quot;, where they endlessly praised it seemingly only because it was a music video—in particular, Butt-head could be heard gasping for breath due to laughing uncontrollably. It was, however, implied at the very end of the review that they were both [[Nutmeg#Psychoactivity and toxicity|high on nutmeg]], with Beavis remarking “Hey Butt-head, you got any more nutmeg?”

Although Beavis and Butt-head share the same musical tastes, there were some rare occasions where opinions largely conflicted. An obvious example can be seen during the video review for &quot;[[Something for the Pain]]&quot; by [[Bon Jovi]] (whom the duo referred to as a &quot;wuss band&quot;) in which Beavis claimed to enjoy one part of the song, causing Butt-head to smack him repeatedly, claiming to be doing it for &quot;Beavis' own good.&quot; However, Beavis insisted on enjoying the song and singing along to the main lyrics, and eventually retaliated against Butt-head by kicking him in the [[testicle]]s—twice—and praising Bon Jovi by proclaiming, &quot;You can't tell me what sucks! I like this, so blow it up your ass!&quot; A less dramatic example can be seen during [[R.E.M.]]'s video for &quot;[[Shiny Happy People]]&quot;, where Beavis sings along to the lyrics, provoking another repeated smacking by Butt-head. In another episode, during the review of Metallica's &quot;[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (Metallica song)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]&quot;, Butt-head repeatedly claims that Metallica sucks, much to Beavis's annoyance.

The ultimate compliment would have been parallel to the ultimate put-down (see previous) and would have consisted of them simply being silent for the video's duration. An example of this happened very early on in the series when they watched &quot;[[Who Was in My Room Last Night?]]&quot; by the [[Butthole Surfers]] and remained completely silent throughout (only giving quips of praise at the very beginning and end of the video). Another example is where they were watching &quot;California&quot; by [[Wax (rock band)|Wax]], which featured a man running around on fire. Butt-head praised the video, but Beavis, being a pyromaniac (and [[Mike Judge]] having been instructed by the MTV higher-ups to not say the word &quot;fire&quot;), chose to stare at the video and say nothing. Butt-head got annoyed by this, and tried to snap Beavis out of his seemingly catatonic state. Another example was the [[Ramones]]'s &quot;[[I Wanna Be Sedated]]&quot;, where they did not praise the band verbally other than Beavis saying &quot;YES!&quot; when the video starts, but headbanged for the video's duration (along with occasionally humming the main riff). In other reviews, during particularly good videos, Butt-head would tell Beavis to shut up because he wanted to see the video.

The duo showed some signs of intelligence when it came to some bands and artists, despite the fact that they did not know much about even their favorite bands. On one occasion, they claimed that [[Phil Anselmo|&quot;Pantera&quot;]] had an abusive upbringing. They knew practically nothing about the band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], and thought that Hole was the name of the [[Courtney Love|lead singer]]. During a Foo Fighters video review, Butt-head recognized the lead singer as Dave Grohl, referring to him as &quot;that dude from 'Nirvarna'.&quot; Beavis thought Butt-head was referring to deceased Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain and said &quot;Butt-head, I don't think that dude's with us anymore, you shouldn't say that.&quot; Butt-head patiently explained to Beavis that Grohl was the drummer with Nirvana and was now playing guitar for the Foo Fighters. Sometimes they mistook some bands for others. They believed they were watching a Red Hot Chili Peppers video when they were really watching a Faith No More video. In another review, the duo was watching [[Marilyn Manson]]'s music video for &quot;The Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot; and initially thought that Manson was [[Cher]]. Beavis then confused Marilyn Manson for [[Charles Manson]] before being corrected by Butt-head. On several occasions, the two mistook musicians for other celebrities, such as [[Boy George]] as [[Debbie Gibson]], [[The Clash]] guitarist [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] as [[Jerry Seinfeld]], a member of Japanese pop band [[Pizzicato Five]] as Ernie from &quot;[[My Three Sons]]&quot;, members of [[Color Me Badd]] as [[Kenny G]], [[Ofra Haza]] as [[Paula Abdul]], and both [[Yanni]] and [[John Oates]] as [[Geraldo Rivera]]. They also sometimes made crude puns on the names of celebrities (believing the names they said were really the celebrities' names) who came to mind during a video they were watching; some of these included [[Connie Chung]] as Connie Schlong, [[Bette Midler]] as Butt Midler, [[Olivia Newton-John]] as Olivia [[Neutering|Neuter]]-John and [[Steffi Graf]] as [[erection|Stiffie]] Graf. They even mistook [[Rosie O'Donnell]], in the video &quot;(Meet) The Flinstones&quot; by [[The B-52's]], for [[Roseanne Barr|Roseanne]] and called her Buttseanne.
	 
Bands and videos were not the only subjects of which they were critical. They also engaged in conversation about films, television shows, certain people and other pop culture references. Occasionally, they praised the subject, but were more often derisive.

==Critical assessments and controversy==
Over its run, ''Beavis and Butt-head'' drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reactions from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= TELEVISION; Keeping Beavis and Butt-head Just Stupid Enough
|work= New York Times|date=October 17, 1993|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/arts/television-keeping-beavis-and-butt-head-just-stupid-enough.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Beavis%20and%20Butt-head&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-11 | first=Elizabeth | last=Kolbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the focus of criticism from social conservatives, such as [[Michael Medved]], while others, such as [[David Letterman]], and the conservative magazine ''[[National Review]]'', defended it as a cleverly subversive vehicle for social criticism and a particularly creative and intelligent comedy. Either way, the show captured the imaginations of many young television viewers in the United States and abroad and is often considered a classic piece of 1990s youth culture and the [[MTV|MTV generation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= MTV Was, Like, Totally Right to Relocate Show|last= Rosenberg|first= Howard|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1993-10-20|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-20/entertainment/ca-47729_1_children-watch-tv|accessdate=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Dan Tobin of ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]'' commented on the series' humor, stating that it transformed &quot;stupidity into a crusade, forcing us to acknowledge how little it really takes to make us laugh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/11/BEAVIS_AND_BUTTHEAD.html Butting out],&quot; ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Ted Drozdowski of ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]'' described the 1997 ''Beavis and Butt-head'' state as &quot;reduced to self-parody of their self-parody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/05/TEN_REASONS.html Eye pleasers],&quot; ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006, [[TV Guide]] ranked the duo's distinct laughing at #66 on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvland.com/originals/catchphrases/quotes.jhtml The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases], [[TV Guide]]. Retrieved on 2008-04-02. In 2010, it was ranked no. 8 by [[TV Guide]] in their list of &quot;TV's Top 25 Animated Shows&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of promoting dangerous behavior===
Early episodes gave them a juvenile obsession with fire and dangerous behavior (summed up with Beavis' chant of &quot;Fire! Fire!&quot;). The show was blamed for a two-year-old's death which occurred in [[Moraine, Ohio]] in October 1993 in which a five-year-old boy set fire to his mother's mobile home, killing his two year old sister.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2&quot;&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'' article: [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2DF143EF933A25753C1A965958260 CARTOON ON MTV BLAMED FOR FIRE].&lt;/ref&gt; The mother later claimed that her son had watched one of the fire-related segments shortly before he burned down the home,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2&quot; /&gt; although, according to an article in the March 24, 1994 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', neighbors claimed that the family did not have cable television.

As a result, the references were excised from further airings. The creators found a censorship [[loophole]] and took delight in sometimes making Beavis scream things that sounded very similar to his previous &quot;Fire! Fire!&quot; (such as &quot;Fryer! Fryer!&quot; when he and Butt-head are working the late shift at Burger World) and also having him almost say the forbidden word (such as one time when he sang &quot;Liar, liar, pants on...&quot; and pausing before &quot;fire&quot; (in the &quot;Liar! Liar!&quot; episode). There was also a music video where a man runs on fire in slow motion (&quot;California&quot; by [[Wax (rock band)|Wax]]). Beavis is hypnotized by it and can barely say &quot;Fire.&quot; References to fire were cut from earlier episodes&amp;nbsp;— even the original tapes were altered permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sonic.net/~goblin/9beavis.html | title=Mike Judge interview | publisher= Goblin Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other episodes MTV opted not to rerun included &quot;Stewart's House&quot; and &quot;Way Down Mexico Way&quot;. Early episodes with the controversial content intact are rare, and are traded on homemade video recordings made from the original broadcasts. In an interview included with the recent ''Mike Judge Collection'' DVD set, Judge denied being certain if some of the earlier episodes still existed in their uncensored form. When the film ''[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]'' came out, Beavis finally got the chance to yell out &quot;FIRE!&quot; in excitement when a biker (voiced by [[David Letterman]]) farts towards the campfire resulting in a huge fire explosion. When Beavis and Butt-head made a cameo during the MTV Video Music Awards around 2005, they were shown dressed in robes in a fancy living room. Beavis uses an air blower to keep a fire going. He quietly utters out &quot;Fire.&quot; This scene was reused when Beavis and Butt-head promoted the film ''[[Extract (film)|Extract]]''.

In February 1994, watchdog group [[Morality in Media]] claimed that the death of 8-month-old Natalia Rivera, struck by a bowling ball thrown from an overpass onto a [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] highway near the [[Holland Tunnel]] by 18-year-old Calvin J. Settle, was partially inspired by ''Beavis and Butt-head''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'' article: [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400EEDF1538F933A25751C0A962958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Youth Is Held in Death from Bowling Ball].&lt;/ref&gt; The group said that Settle was influenced by the episode entitled &quot;Ball Breakers&quot;, in which Beavis and Butt-head loaded a bowling ball with explosives and dropped it from a rooftop.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt; While Morality in Media claimed that the show inspired Settle's actions, the case's prosecutors did not. Later it was revealed by both prosecutors and the defendant as well, that Settle did not have cable TV and did not watch the show.

===Responses by writers and MTV===

In one episode, the show parodied blaming actions on youth culture. When asked by a reporter why they were flying a kite in a rainstorm, the duo explained that they were inspired by a documentary about [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Not satisfied, the reporter continued asking them leading questions until they mentioned that they had watched some rock music videos earlier in the day. The following scene is the reporter on TV blaming the music videos for the duo's actions.

MTV also responded by broadcasting the program after 11:00 P.M., and made a disclaimer, reminding viewers that:
: Beavis and Butt-head are not real. They are stupid cartoon people completely made up by this [[Mike Judge|Texas guy]] whom we hardly even know. Beavis and Butt-head are dumb, crude, thoughtless, ugly, sexist, self destructive fools. But for some reason, the little weinerheads make us laugh.
This was later changed to:
: Beavis and Butt-head are not role models. They're not even human, they're cartoons. Some of the things they do could cause a person to get hurt, expelled, arrested, possibly deported. To put it another way: Don't try this at home.
This disclaimer also appears before the opening of their [[Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] game as well as their Windows game ''[[Beavis and Butt-head in Virtual Stupidity]]''.

They were famously lambasted by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senator [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] as &quot;Buffcoat and Beaver.&quot; This would subsequently become a running gag on the show where adults mispronounced their names (Tom Anderson originally calling them &quot;Butthole and Joe&quot;, and believing the two to be of Asian ethnicity. In a later episode, Tom Anderson used the Hollings mispronunciation once, President Clinton called them &quot;Beamis and Bum-head&quot; in one episode, as well as in the [[Beavis and Butt-head Do America|movie]], where an old lady consistently calls them &quot;Travis&quot; and &quot;Bob-head&quot;).

Beavis and Butt-head have been compared to [[Savant syndrome|idiot savant]]s because of their creative and subversively intelligent observations of music videos. This part of the show was mostly improvised by Mike Judge. With regard to criticisms of the two as &quot;idiots,&quot; Judge responded that a show about straight-A students would not be funny.

==Films==
{{Main|Beavis and Butt-head Do America}}
In 1996, a full-length movie featuring the duo entitled ''Beavis and Butt-head Do America'' was released in theaters. The movie features the voices of [[Bruce Willis]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Richard Linklater]], [[Greg Kinnear]] (in an uncredited role), and [[David Letterman]] (credited as Earl Hofert). It gained mostly positive reviews from film critics and a &quot;two thumbs up&quot; from Siskel and Ebert. The film earned over $60 million at the domestic box office, a strong return for a film that cost only $5 million to produce.

Also, in recent interviews, Judge claims that he is interested in producing a [[live-action]] movie. He said that previously he despised the idea, but now he thinks &quot;maybe there's something there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2008/05/15/beavis_and_butthead_to_make_a_big_screen 'Beavis And Butthead' To Make A Big Screen Return - Starpulse Entertainment News Blog].&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview for Collider on August 25, 2009, Judge told them, &quot;I like to keep the door open on Beavis and Butt-Head, because it's my favorite thing that I've ever done. It's the thing I'm most proud of.&quot; However, he also added, &quot;Another movie... the problem is it takes a year and half, two years, two and a half years - maybe - to do that right. And that's a pretty strong level of commitment. I'm going to look at that again. That comes up every three years.&quot; One of his ideas is bringing back the characters as old men, instead of teenagers. &quot;I kind of think of them as being either 15 or in their 60s,&quot; he said. &quot;I wouldn't mind doing something with them as these two dirty old men sitting on the couch.&quot; Judge added that he wouldn't completely ignore the time that has passed in between. &quot;At one point I thought Butt-Head might do okay on some really low-level sales job.

===Marvel Comics===
From 1994 to 1996, [[Marvel Comics]] published a monthly ''Beavis and Butt-head'' comic &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotextra.com/bandbcollectiblescomics.html Beavis and Butthead Central]&lt;/ref&gt; by a variety of writers, but with each issue drawn by artist Rick Parker. It was also reprinted by Marvel UK, which created new editorial material.

The letter's page was answered by 'Beavis and Butt-head' or one of their supporting characters. Instead of reviewing music videos, they reviewed (custom-made) pages from other Marvel Comics - in one with [[Ghost Rider]], Beavis tries to avoid using the word &quot;fire&quot; to describe the character's fiery skull. 

In the comic, [[List of minor characters in Beavis and Butt-head|minor characters]] like Earl, Billy Bob, Clark Cobb, and Mistress Cora Anthrax would get repeated appearances; Earl was quite regular, and Anthrax was in two issues and got to answer a letter's page.

*Beavis and Butt-Head resurfaced in late August, 2009, presenting a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZcn7ubEFy8&amp;fmt=18 clip] from Mike Judge's latest film ''[[Extract (film)|Extract]]'', during [[Jason Bateman]]'s appearance on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' to promote the film.
*The duo make an appearance at the start of ''[[Jackass 3D]]'', explaining to the audience how the 3D segments of the film work by way of Butt-head punching Beavis repeatedly in the face, making him believe the punches were caused by his 3D glasses.

==''Daria'' spin-off==
In 1997, a spin-off show based on their classmate Daria Morgendorffer, ''[[Daria]]'', was created. [[Mike Judge]] was not credited as a producer of this series and has said he was not involved with it at all, except to give permission for the use of the character. The Daria character had been created for ''Beavis and Butt-head'' by [[Glenn Eichler]] and originally designed by Bill Peckmann of J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. Eichler then became a producer for ''Daria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Brainy 'Beavis' Pal 'Daria' Spins Off |publisher= Los Angeles Times|date=March 3, 1997|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997-03-03/entertainment/ca-34294_1_daria-morgendorffer|accessdate=2010-11-20 | first=Howard | last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first episode of ''Daria'', she and her family move from Beavis and Butt-head's hometown of Highland to Lawndale - the only references to the original show is a single mention of Highland in the first episode, with Daria saying Lawndale can't be a second Highland &quot;unless there's uranium in the drinking water here too&quot; and the duo are mentioned only once as &quot;those two boys&quot;.

==Videos and DVDs==
{{cleanup|section|date=January 2007}}
The first official [[home video]] releases of ''Beavis and Butt-head'' were two [[VHS]] tapes entitled ''There Goes The Neighborhood'' and ''[[Beavis and Butt-head: Work Sucks|Work Sucks!]]'', distributed by [[Sony]] Music Video and MTV Home Video in 1994. Each tape contained approximately eight episodes, each selected from the first four seasons. Although most of the episodes were presented complete (but without music video segments), a handful of episodes from Seasons 2 and 3 were edited for content similar to their broadcast runs. Nine more VHS compilations were released from 1995 to 1999 (''Troubled Youth'', ''The Final Judgment'', ''Law-Abiding Citizens'', ''Hard Cash'', ''Butt-O-Ween'', ''Beavis and Butt-Head Do Christmas'', ''Innocence Lost'', ''Chicks 'n' Stuff'', ''Feel Our Pain'') for a total of 11, containing episodes from every season of the show except the first.

The Contents of the ''[[Beavis and Butt-head: Work Sucks|Work Sucks!]]'' and ''There Goes The Neighborhood'' VHS compilations were combined into a single [[Laserdisc]] compilation entitled ''Beavis and Butt-head: The Essential Collection'', which was also released by Sony Music Video in 1994. This was the sole release of ''Beavis and Butt-head'' in the Laserdisc format (other than the [[Beavis and Butt-head Do America|feature-film]]).

All VHS collections of episodes are out of print. They were compiled into two sets of three multi-episode [[Time–Life]] DVD releases called ''The Best of Beavis and Butt-head'', which are also no longer available. A set of three DVDs from Time-Life containing the same content as six of the VHS editions was released in December 2002. The remaining five VHS programs were also released on DVD soon afterwards but were not equally advertised (if at all) and are subsequently rarer.

Several more VHS compilations were also released exclusively in the United Kingdom, between 1997 and 2002, in addition to PAL versions of the 11 American tapes. Some UK-only compilations include a three-part series entitled ''History of Beavis'' which contained the all of the Season 1 episodes, as well as a &quot;Too Dumb For TV&quot; compilation dedicated to some of the banned episodes such as &quot;Stewart's House&quot; and &quot;Way Down Mexico Way.&quot; A fourth volume of ''History of Beavis'' was scheduled, but pulled from release at the last minute. Unlike the American tapes, some of the UK-only tapes contained music videos.

A two-disc DVD set titled ''The History of Beavis and Butt-head'' was scheduled for release in September 2002 containing the program content of four of the UK-exclusive VHS tapes. However, its release was cancelled at the last moment at the demand of Judge, who owned approval rights for video releases of the series. Many copies were mistakenly put on store shelves on the scheduled release date, only to be immediately recalled. The set started selling on [[eBay]] at very high prices, sometimes over $300 USD. According to Judge, the ''History'' set was made up of episodes that he had previously rejected for home video release and had been prepared without his knowledge or consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23060 Mike Judge | The A.V. Club].&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2005, MTV and [[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]] released a three-disc DVD compilation titled ''[[Beavis and Butt-head: The Mike Judge Collection]]'', Volume 1. The DVD set includes 40 episodes and 11 music video segments from the original shows. All prior VHS and DVD releases have lacked these segments except for the VHS release of ''Beavis and Butt-head Do Christmas'', and the last disc of the second Time-Life set.

23 of the 40 episodes included on the ''Mike Judge Collection'' were advertised to have been director's cuts containing &quot;previously censored material.&quot; However, the majority of the &quot;Director's Cut&quot; episodes are actually missing footage from their original broadcast versions, although two episodes (&quot;Home Improvement&quot; and &quot;Lawn and Garden&quot;) did indeed have excised footage reinstated. The following (known to date) edits were all made in Vol. 1 to correct &quot;animation mistakes&quot; according to Mike Judge:
* Lawn &amp; Garden: The part where Butt-head holds the chainsaw and screams &quot;Welcome to the jungle...you're gonna die&quot; while headbanging has been removed.
* 1-900-BEAVIS: The lines, &quot;She said something,&quot; &quot;I think I just inoculated,&quot; and &quot;Hey, maybe we'll hear some butt wind,&quot; have been removed.
* Madame Blavatsky: Beavis and Butt-head's fighting scene at the end is cut short; also, Madam Blavatsky's line, when she says, &quot;The end of the world,&quot; has been edited.
* Late Night With Butt-head: The first minute and a half of this episode has been removed; instead, it starts with Beavis and Butt-head pitching the idea for their talk show. Letterman's cameo voice appearance has been removed. Also, Beavis and Butt-head celebrating with an air guitar chant after successfully pitching their show has been removed.
* Right On: A scene where Beavis and Butt-head are doing their air guitar chant, after they found out they will be on the Gus Baker show has been removed. Also, at the very end, the part where Butt-head tells Beavis that it would not hurt to wipe once in while has been removed.
* Date Bait: Scene where Beavis and Butt-head are on the couch with a cold and Butt-head doing the &quot;Handbanging-Sneeze&quot; (also showing the Metal sign) has been removed.
* Figure Drawing: The teacher's comment, about teaching a class on aromatherapy, is removed. Three or four lines (after Beavis and Butt-head rearrange the letters on the sign) have also been cut. Several other dialogue cuts were made throughout.
* Teen Talk: A scene where Beavis and Butt-head do their air guitar chant, after Lolita and Tanqueray ask if they want to make out behind the risers, has been removed.
* Held Back: In the scene where Beavis and Butt-head are in third grade, and will not fit in the chairs, the lines, &quot;This desk is giving me a stiffie,&quot; and, &quot;I don't even have room for a stiffie,&quot; have been removed.
* Safe House: A scene with Beavis, Butt-head and Todd watching a funny &quot;World of Bikini Sports&quot; segment has been removed, when the bikini girl tells the sports anchor to take his hands off her buttocks.
* Tainted Meat: The middle section of the news broadcast, talking about &quot;a fierce new parasite,&quot; has been removed. It, much like the deleted scene in &quot;Manners Suck&quot; (see below), was included as an Easter Egg on Disc 2.
* Manners Suck: The ending, where Beavis and Butt-head are in the stalls politely defecating, is removed. It was, however, included as an Easter Egg on Disc 1.
* Dream On: The duo sings and makes up their own Brady Bunch theme song lyrics.
* Butt-o-ween: A scene from when the duo are improvising costumes for trick-or-treating, Beavis walks up to Butt-Head while wearing a black &quot;Winger&quot; t-shirt (similar to the one Stewart wears) and sings a line from the song &quot;She's only seventeen&quot; provoking Butt-head to slap him across the face disapprovingly was removed, most likely as a result of a legal threat from the band's lead singer.

''The Mike Judge Collection, Volume 2'' was released on June 13, 2006. This compilation features 40 additional episodes, 13 music videos, and a ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' parody featuring Beavis and Butt-head, which uses a similar score and format as Brokeback's movie trailer. The parody functions as a commercial for the DVD release of ''Mike Judge Collection, Volume 3''. Also included are segments from the ''Beavis and Butt-head'' &quot;Butt Bowl&quot; specials, traditionally aired during halftime of the [[Super Bowl]]; parodies of [[Calvin Klein]] advertisements are also featured. In Volume 2, edits on previous VHS/DVD releases of the episode &quot;Bungholio - Lord of the Harvest&quot; (then called &quot;Butt-o-Ween&quot;) have not been reinstated. 

''The Mike Judge Collection, Volume 3'' was released on August 1, 2006. 42 episodes are featured, as well as 15 music video segments. Bonus features include the original, uncut &quot;Frog Baseball&quot; episode, and many (if not all) of the Christmas-related clips. Despite the criticism received over severe episode censorship in Vol. 1, edits were again made on at least two episodes - a scene where Beavis and Butt-head cut their teacher's chair in half was removed from &quot;Woodshop,&quot; and a short line from Beavis from &quot;Impotence.&quot;

''The Mike Judge Collections'' have been the subject of heavy criticism among fans. This is mostly due to the DVD sets not being proper season sets and missing many episodes. All of Season 1 is missing and most of Season 2 is not included either. A number of episodes from remaining seasons have been excluded as well. This was explained via a note included in ''The Mike Judge Collection, Volume 1'' in which Mike Judge writes &quot;I've often said there's about a third of Beavis and Butt-head that I think is great and I'm really proud of, another third that is okay, and then another third that's really awful and embarrassing. A while back, I talked with the folks at MTV and we agreed to put out a DVD set that would contain the two thirds that didn't suck and call it The Mike Judge Collection.&quot; Despite this, proper season sets with all episodes intact remain highly coveted by fans.

On January 26, 2006, MTV and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] released ''Beavis and Butt-head, Vol. 1'' on the [[iTunes Store]].

==Revival==
On July 14, 2010, a spokesperson for MTV Networks informed a ''[[New York Post]]'' reporter that Mike Judge is creating a new ''Beavis and Butt-head'' series, that Judge will reprise his voice-acting roles for the show, and that the animation will be hand-drawn. However, according to [[TMZ]], MTV has not yet asked [[Tracy Grandstaff]] to reprise her role as [[Daria Morgendorffer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2011/02/05/beavis-butthead-daria-morgendorffer-mtv-show-mike-judge/|title=Daria Left Out of 'Beavis and Butt-Head' Reboot|publisher=TMZ|date=2011-02-08|accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the old series, Beavis and Butt-head are high school students who, among other things, critique contemporary music videos.&lt;ref name=&quot;revival&quot;/&gt; In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', MTV president Van Toffler said that the duo will also watch ''[[Jersey Shore]]'', [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] matches, and amateur videos from [[YouTube]], as well as give movie reviews. &quot;The biggest change is obviously the references are updated, it’s set in modern day, and there’s going to be a movie review segment,&quot; Linn said. &quot;Otherwise they’re still true to their prior passions.&quot; &lt;ref name=rs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/exclusive-new-beavis-and-butthead-will-tackle-jersey-shore-and-more-20110216|title=Exclusive: New 'Beavis and Butt-Head' Will Tackle 'Jersey Shore' and More|last=Greene|first=Andy|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=2011-02-16|accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Altschuler, formerly a writer for ''[[King of the Hill]]'', told a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reporter of the signs he noticed that Mike Judge was thinking of reviving ''Beavis and Butt-head''. On more than one occasion, Judge told the writers that one of their ideas for an episode of ''King of the Hill'' would work well for ''Beavis and Butt-head''; eventually he concluded, &quot;Maybe we should just actually make some good ''Beavis and Butt-head'' episodes.&quot; Later, a [[Lady Gaga]] video convinced Van Toffler of the tenability of a ''Beavis and Butt-head'' revival: &quot;I felt like there was a whole crop of new artists—and what the world sorely missed was the point-of-view that only Beavis and Butt-head could bring.&quot;&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

As part of a promotional campaign for the new series, cinemas screening ''[[Jackass 3D]]'' opened the [[feature film]] with a [[3-D film|3-D]] ''Beavis and Butt-head'' short subject. Months later, in a media presentation on February 2, 2011, MTV announced that the series would premiere in the summer of 2011.

The '''''Bromeliales''''' is the [[botanical name]] of an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[flowering plants]].  Such an order has been recognized by a few [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|systems]] of plant taxonomy, with a various placement.  It appears that it always has had the same [[wiktionary:circumscription|circumscription]]: 
consisting only of the family ''[[Bromeliaceae]]'', the bromeliad or [[pineapple]] family.  The order is not recognized in the [[APG II system]], of 2003, which places the plants involved in the order ''[[Poales]]''.

It is best known from the [[Cronquist system]], of 1981, which placed this order in subclass ''[[Zingiberidae]]'', of class ''[[Liliopsida]]'' [=monocotyledons].

The [[Thorne system (1992)]] placed the order in superorder ''[[Commelinanae]]'' in subclass ''[[Liliidae]]'' [=monocotyledons].

The [[Dahlgren system]] placed the order in superorder ''[[Bromelianae]]'' in subclass ''[[Liliidae]]'' [=monocotyledons].

The [[Engler system]], in its update of 1964, placed the order in class ''[[Monocotyledoneae]]''.

The '''Brassicales''' are an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[flowering plant]]s, belonging to the [[eurosids II]] group of [[dicotyledon]]s under the [[APG II]] system. One character common to many members of the order is the production of [[glucosinolate]] (mustard oil) compounds. Most systems of classification have included this order, although sometimes under the name '''Capparales''' (the name chosen depending on which is thought to have priority).&lt;ref name=&quot;hall2002&quot;&gt;Hall ''et al.'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The order typically contains the following families&lt;ref&gt;Haston ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Family [[Akaniaceae]]
* Family [[Bataceae]] (salt-tolerant shrubs from America and [[Australasia]])
* Family [[Brassicaceae]] ([[Mustard plant|mustard]] and [[cabbage]] family) (may include the [[Cleomaceae]])
* Family [[Capparaceae]] ([[caper]] family, sometimes included in [[Brassicaceae]])
* Family [[Caricaceae]] ([[papaya]] family)
* Family [[Gyrostemonaceae]]
* Family [[Koeberliniaceae]]
* Family [[Limnanthaceae]] ([[meadowfoam]] family)
* Family [[Moringa]]ceae (thirteen species of trees from Africa and India)
* Family [[Pentadiplandraceae]]
* Family [[Resedaceae]] ([[Mignonette (Reseda)|mignonette]] family)
* Family [[Salvadoraceae]]
* Family [[Setchellanthaceae]]
* Family [[Tovariaceae]]
* Family [[Tropaeolaceae]] ([[nasturtium]] family)

Under the [[Cronquist system]], the Brassicales were called the Capparales, and included among the &quot;[[Dilleniidae]]&quot;.  The only families included were the [[Brassicaceae]] and [[Capparaceae]] (treated as separate families), the [[Tovariaceae]], [[Resedaceae]], and [[Moringaceae]].  Other taxa now included here were placed in various different orders.

The families Capparaceae and Brassicaceae are closely related.  One group, consisting of ''[[Cleome]]'' and related genera, was traditionally included in the Capparaceae but doing so results in a [[paraphyletic]] Capparaceae.&lt;ref name=&quot;hall2002&quot;/&gt;  Therefore, this group is generally now either included in the Brassicaceae or as its own family, [[Cleomaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Hall ''et al.'' (2004) and the APG II update by Haston ''et al.'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Bulletin Board System''', or '''BBS''', is a [[computer]] [[host (network)|system]] running [[list of BBS software|software]] that allows [[User (computing)|users]] to [[Telecommunication circuit|connect]] and [[Logging (computer security)|log in]] to the system using a [[terminal program]]. Once logged in, a [[User (computing)|user]] can perform functions such as [[uploading and downloading]] software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other [[User (computing)|users]], either through [[electronic mail]] or in public [[message boards]]. Many BBSes also offer [[BBS door|on-line games]], in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide [[chat room]]s, allowing users to interact with each other. 

Originally BBSes were accessed only over a [[public switched telephone network|phone line]] using a [[modem]], but by the early 1990s some BBSes allowed access via a [[Telnet]], [[packet switched network]], or [[packet radio]] connection.

[[Ward Christensen]] coined the term &quot;Bulletin Board System&quot; as a reference to the traditional cork-and-pin [[bulletin board]] often found in entrances of supermarkets, schools, libraries or other public areas where people can post messages, advertisements, or community news.  By &quot;computerizing&quot; this method of communications, the name of the system was born: CBBS - Computerized Bulletin Board System. See [[#History|History]]. 

During their heyday from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s, most BBSes were run as a [[hobby]] free of charge by the system operator (or &quot;[[SysOp]]&quot;), while other BBSes charged their users a subscription fee for access, or were operated by a business as a means of supporting their customers. Bulletin Board Systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the [[World Wide Web]], [[social network service]]s and other aspects of the [[Internet]]. 

Early BBSes were often a local phenomenon, as one had to dial into a BBS with a phone line and would have to pay additional long distance charges for a BBS out of the local calling area. Thus, many [[User (computing)|users]] of a given BBS usually lived in the same area, and activities such as ''BBS Meets'' or ''Get Togethers'', where many users of the board would gather and meet face to face, were common.

As the use of the Internet became more widespread in the mid to late 1990s, traditional BBSes rapidly faded in popularity. Today, [[Internet forum]]s occupy much of the same social and technological space as BBSes did, and the term BBS is often used to refer to any online forum or message board.

Although BBSing survives only as a niche hobby in most parts of the world, it is still an extremely popular form of communication for Taiwanese youth (see [[PTT Bulletin Board System]]). Most BBSes are now accessible over [[telnet]] and typically offer free [[email]] accounts, FTP services, [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] and all of the [[Communications protocol|protocols]] commonly used on the Internet.

==History==
A precursor to the public Bulletin Board System was [[Community Memory]], started in August, 1973 in [[Berkeley, California]], using hardwired terminals located in neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crosby|first=Kip|date=November 1995|title=CONVIVIAL CYBERNETIC DEVICES|journal=The ANALYTICAL ENGINE|publisher=Computer History Association of California|volume=3|issue=1|issn=1071-6351|url=http://www.opencollector.org/history/homebrew/engv3n1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public [[dial-up]] Bulletin Board System was developed by [[Ward Christensen]]. According to an early interview, while he was snowed in during the [[Great Blizzard of 1978]] in Chicago, Christensen along with fellow hobbyist Randy Suess, began preliminary work on the [[Computerized Bulletin Board System]], or [[CBBS]]. CBBS went online on February 16, 1978 in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=ward&gt;[http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/AAA/AAA/CBBS/memories.txt Collection of Memories of writing and running the first BBS by Ward Christensen (Circa 1992)], ''BBSDocumentary.com'', retrieved June 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; CBBS, which kept a count of callers, reportedly connected 253,301 callers before it was finally retired.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

With the original 110 and 300 [[baud]] modems of the late 1970s, BBSes were particularly slow, but speed improved with the introduction of 1200 [[Bits per second|bit/s]] modems in the [[Modem#Increasing speeds|early 1980s]], and this led to a substantial increase in popularity. The demand for complex ANSI and ASCII screens and larger file transfers taxed available [[channel capacity]], which in turn propelled demand for faster modems.

Most of the [[information]] was displayed using ordinary [[ASCII]] text or [[ANSI art]], though some BBSes experimented with higher resolution visual formats such as the innovative but obscure [[Remote Imaging Protocol]]. Many systems became quite sophisticated in graphic presentation, especially considering that the system was confined to ASCII codes. Several systems attempted to simulate the appearance of GUI displays which were just appearing as DOS add-ons or Apple systems. Probably the ultimate development of graphic presentations was the Dynamic page implementation of the [[University of Southern California]] [[BBS]] (USCBBS) by Susan Biddlecomb, which predated the implementation of the [[HTML]] [[Dynamic web page]]. A complete &quot;[[Dynamic web page]]&quot; implementation was accomplished using [[TBBS]] with a [[TDBS]] add-on presenting a complete menu system individually customized for each user.

During the mid 1980s, a very popular BBS software &quot;RBBS-PC&quot; became commonly used by students, schools, churches and more.  One of the largest BBSes of the time was known as &quot;Avery I&quot; and run by a young System Operator from a small town in North Carolina (Greg J. Gardner).  This was one of the largest private and non-profit BBSes of the time.

Towards the early 1990s, the BBS industry became so popular that it spawned three monthly magazines, ''[[Boardwatch]]'', ''[[BBS Magazine]]'', and in Asia and Australia, ''[[Chips 'n Bits Magazine]]'' which devoted extensive coverage of the software and technology innovations and people behind them, and listings to US and worldwide BBSes.&lt;ref name=ChipsnBits&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/54469 Chips 'n' Bits : the Northern Territory Computer Users' newsletter], ''catalogue.nla.gov.au'', retrieved March 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in the USA, a major monthly magazine, ''[[Computer Shopper]]'', carried a list of BBSes along with a brief abstract of each of their offerings. 

According to the [[FidoNet]] Nodelist, BBSes reached their peak usage around 1996, which was the same period that the [[World Wide Web]] suddenly became mainstream. BBSes rapidly declined in popularity thereafter, and were replaced by systems using the [[Internet]] for connectivity. Some of the larger commercial BBSes, such as [[ExecPC BBS]], became actual [[Internet Service Providers]].

The website ''[[textfiles.com]]'' serves as an archive that documents the history of the BBS. The owner of ''textfiles.com'', [[Jason Scott Sadofsky|Jason Scott]], also produced ''[[BBS: The Documentary]]'', a [[DVD]] film that chronicles the history of the BBS and features interviews with well-known people (mostly from the [[United States]]) from the heyday BBS era.

The [http://bbslist.textfiles.com/ historical BBS list] on ''textfiles.com'' contains over 105,000 BBSes that have existed over a span of 20 years in North America alone.

==Software and hardware==
Unlike modern websites and [[online services]] that are typically hosted by third-party companies in commercial [[data center]]s, BBS computers (especially for smaller boards) were typically operated from the SysOp's home. As such, access could be unreliable, and in many cases only one user could be on the system at a time. Only larger BBSs with multiple phone lines using specialized hardware, multitasking software, or a [[LAN]] connecting multiple computers, could host multiple simultaneous users.

The first BBSes used homebrew software,&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;CBBS Chicago (which [[Ward Christensen]] programmed) was about 20,000 lines of 8080 assembler.&lt;/ref&gt; quite often written or customized by the SysOps themselves, running on early [[S-100 bus|S-100]] [[microcomputer]] systems such as the [[Altair 8800|Altair]], [[IMSAI 8080|IMSAI]] and [[Cromemco]] under the [[CP/M]] operating system. Soon after, BBS software was being written for all of the major [[home computer]] systems of the late 1970s era - the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari]], and [[TRS-80]] being some of the most popular.

A few years later in 1981, IBM introduced the first [[DOS]] based [[personal computer|IBM PC]], and due to the overwhelming popularity of PCs and their [[IBM PC Compatible|clones]], DOS soon became the operating system on which the majority of BBS programs were run. [[RBBS-PC]], [[porting|ported]] over from the CP/M world, and ''Fido'' BBS, created by [[Tom Jennings]] (who later founded [[FidoNet]]) were the first notable DOS BBS programs. There were many successful commercial BBS programs developed for DOS, such as [[PCBoard| PCBoard BBS]], [[RemoteAccess|RemoteAccess BBS]], and [[Wildcat! BBS]]. Some popular freeware BBS programs for MS-DOS included [[Telegard|Telegard BBS]] and [[Renegade (BBS)|Renegade BBS]], which both had early origins from leaked [[WWIV|WWIV BBS]] source code. There were several dozen other BBS programs developed over the DOS era, and many were released under the shareware concept, while some were released as freeware including iniquity.

During the mid-1980s, many sysops opted for the less expensive, ubiquitous [[Commodore 64]] (introduced in 1982), which was popular among [[Commodore 64 software#Software Piracy|software pirate groups.]] Popular commercial BBS programs were [[Blue Board]], [[Ivory BBS]], [[Color64]] and [[C-Net DS2|CNet 64]]. In the early 1990s a small number of BBSes were also running on the Commodore [[Amiga]] models [[Amiga 500|500]], [[Amiga 1000|1000]] and [[Amiga 1200|1200]] (using external hard drives), and the [[Amiga 2000]], [[Amiga 3000]] and [[Amiga 4000]] (which had built-in hard drives). Popular BBS software for the Amiga were ABBS, [[Amiexpress]], [[StormforceBBS]], [[Infinity (software)|Infinity]] and [[Tempest]].

MS-DOS continued to be the most popular operating system for BBS use up until the mid-1990s, and in the early years most multi-node BBSes were running under a DOS based multitasker such as [[DesqView]] or consisted of multiple computers connected via a [[LAN]]. (Around 1990, OS/2 came out with &quot;preemptive multitasking&quot; of DOS, an alternative to DESQview for multi-node BBS.) In the late 1980s, a handful of BBS developers implemented multitasking communications routines which, although run under MS-DOS, allowed multiple phone lines and multiple users to connect to the same physical BBS computer. These included Galacticomm's [[MajorBBS]] (later WorldGroup), eSoft [[TBBS]], and [[Falken]]. 

By 1995, many of the DOS-based BBSes had begun switching to modern [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] operating systems, such as [[Os/2|OS/2]], [[Windows 95]], and [[Linux]]. TCP/IP networking allowed most of the remaining BBSes to evolve and include Internet hosting capabilities. Recent BBS software, such as [[Synchronet]], EleBBS, [[Dave's own version of Citadel|DOC]] or [[Wildcat! BBS]] provide access using the [[Telnet]] protocol rather than dialup, or by using legacy MS-DOS based BBS software with a [[FOSSIL]]-to-Telnet redirector such as [[NetFoss]].

BBSes were generally text-based, rather than [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]]-based, and early BBSes conversed using the simple [[ASCII]] character set. However, some home computer manufacturers extended the ASCII character set to take advantage of the advanced color and graphics capabilities of their systems. BBS software authors included these extended character sets in their software, and terminal program authors included the ability to display them when a compatible system was called. Atari's native character set was known as [[ATASCII]], while most Commodore BBSes supported [[PETSCII]]. PETSCII was also supported by the nationwide online service [[Quantum Link]].&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Quantum Link and parts of [[AppleLink]] went on to become [[America Online]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The use of these custom character sets was generally incompatible between manufacturers. Unless a caller was using terminal emulation software written for, and running on, the same type of system as the BBS, the session would simply fall back to simple ASCII output. For example, a Commodore 64 user calling an Atari BBS would use ASCII rather than the machine's native character set. As time progressed, most terminal programs began using the [[ANSI X3.64|ANSI]] standard, but could use their native character set if it was available.

COCONET, a BBS system made by Coconut Computing, Inc., was released in 1988 and only supported a GUI interface (no text interface was available), and worked in EGA/VGA graphics mode, which made it stand out from the text-based BBS systems. COCONET's bitmap and vector graphics and support for multiple type fonts were inspired by the [[PLATO system]], and the graphics capabilities were based on what was available in the Borland BGI graphics library. A number of companies wanted to license the COCONET GUI but Coconut Computing chose not to, and as a result, a competing approach called [[Remote Imaging Protocol]] (RIP) emerged and was promoted by Telegrafix in the early to mid 1990s but it never became widespread. A similar technology called [[NAPLPS]] was also considered, and although it became the underlying graphics technology behind the [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy service]], it never gained popularity in the BBS market. There were several GUI-based BBS's on the [[Apple Macintosh]] platform, including [[TeleFinder]] and [[FirstClass]], but these remained widely used only in the Mac market.

In the UK, the [[BBC Micro]] based OBBS software, available from [[Pace Micro Technology|Pace]] for use with their modems, optionally allowed for colour and graphics using the [[Teletext]] based graphics mode available on that platform. Other systems used the [[Viewdata]] protocols made popular in the UK by [[British Telecom|British Telecom's]] [[Prestel]] service, and the on-line magazine [[Micronet800|Micronet 800]] whom were busy giving away modems with their subscriptions. 

The most popular form of online graphics was [[ANSI art]], which combined the [[Extended ASCII|IBM Extended ASCII]] character set's blocks and symbols with [[ANSI X3.64|ANSI]] [[escape sequence]]s to allow changing colors on demand, provide cursor control and screen formatting, and even basic musical tones. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, most BBSes used ANSI to make elaborate welcome screens, and colorized menus, and thus, ANSI support was a sought-after feature in terminal client programs. The development of ANSI art became so popular that it spawned an entire BBS &quot;[[artscene]]&quot; [[subculture]] devoted to it.

[[Amiga]] program ''Skyline BBS'' was the first in 1987 featuring a script [[markup language]] communication protocol called [[Skypix]] which was capable to give the user a complete graphical interface, featuring rich graphic content, changeable fonts, mouse-controlled actions, animations and sound.&lt;ref name=Skyline&gt;{{cite web | title = BBSDocumentary, An Overview of BBS Programs | url = http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/expanded.html | publisher = [[Jason Scott Sadofsky|Jason Scott]] for [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] Magazine (?) | author = Scott Lee | accessdate = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, most BBS software that is still actively supported, such as WorldGroup, [[Wildcat! BBS]] and [[Citadel/UX]], is Web-enabled, and the traditional text interface has been replaced (or operates concurrently) with a Web-based user interface. For those more nostalgic for the true BBS experience, one can use NetSerial (Windows) or [[DOSBox]] (Windows/*nix) to redirect DOS COM port software to telnet, allowing them to connect to Telnet BBSes using 1980s and 1990s era modem [[terminal emulator|terminal emulation]] software, like [[Telix]], [[Terminate]], [[Qmodem]] and [[Procomm Plus]]. Modern 32-bit terminal emulators such as mTelnet and [[Synchronet#SyncTerm|SyncTerm]] include native telnet support.

==Content and access==
Since early BBS' were frequently run by computer hobbyists, they were typically technical in nature with user communities revolving around hardware and software discussions. Many SysOps were transplants of the [[amateur radio]] community and thus amateur and [[packet radio]] were often popular topics. 

As the BBS phenomenon grew, so did the popularity of special interest boards. Bulletin Board Systems could be found for almost every hobby and interest. Popular interests included politics, religion, music, [[matchmaker.com|dating]], and [[alternative lifestyle]]s. Many SysOps also adopted a [[Theme (computing)|theme]] in which they customized their entire BBS (welcome screens, prompts, menus, and so on.) to reflect that theme. Common themes were based on [[fantasy]], or were intended to give the user the illusion of being somewhere else, such as in a [[sanatorium]], wizard's castle, or on a [[pirate ship]].

In the early days, the file download library consisted of files that the SysOps obtained themselves from other BBS and friends. Many BBSes inspected every file uploaded to their public file download library to ensure that the material did not violate copyright law. As time went on, Shareware CD ROMs were sold with up to thousands of files on each CD ROM. Small BBS copied each file individually to their hard drive. Some systems used a CD ROM drive to make the files available. Advanced BBS used Multiple CD ROM disk changer units that switched 6 CD ROM disks on demand for the caller(s). Large systems used all 26 DOS Drive letters with multi-disk changers housing tens of thousands of copyright free shareware or freeware files available to all callers. These BBSes were generally more family friendly, avoiding the seedier side of BBSes. Access to these systems varied from single to multiple modem lines with some requiring little or no confirmed registration.

Some BBSes, called elite, warez or pirate boards, were exclusively used for distributing [[pirated software]], [[phreaking]], and other questionable or unlawful content. These BBSes often had multiple modems and phone lines, allowing several users to upload and download files at once. Most elite BBSes used some form of new user verification, where new users would have to apply for membership and attempt to prove that they were not a law enforcement officer or a ''[[lamer]].'' The largest elite boards accepted users by invitation only. Elite boards also spawned their own subculture and gave rise to the [[slang]] known today as [[leet]]speak.

Another common type of board was the &quot;support BBS&quot; run by a manufacturer of computer products or software. These boards were dedicated to supporting users of the company's products with question and answer forums, news and updates, and downloads. Most of them were not a free call. Today, these services have moved to the web.

[[File:Tggroups editor.png|thumb|Access group editor in a developer build of OpenTG BBS]]
Some general purpose Bulletin Board Systems had special levels of access that were given to those who paid extra money, uploaded useful files or knew the sysop personally. These specialty and pay BBSes usually had something special to offer their users such as large file libraries, [[warez]], [[pornography]], [[chat rooms]] or [[Internet]] access. 

Pay BBSes such as The [[WELL (virtual community)|WELL]] and Echo NYC (now Internet forums rather than dial-up), [[ExecPC BBS|ExecPC]], and [[MindVox]] (which folded in 1996) were admired for their tightly-knit communities and quality discussion forums. However, many &quot;free&quot; BBSes also maintained close knit communities, and some even had annual or bi-annual events where users would travel great distances to meet face-to-face with their on-line friends. These events were especially popular with BBSes that offered [[chat rooms]].

Some of the BBSes that provided access to illegal content did wind up in trouble. On July 12, 1985, in conjunction with a [[credit card fraud]] investigation, the [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County, NJ]] Sheriff's department raided and seized The Private Sector BBS, which was the official BBS for [[grey hat]] hacker quarterly [[2600 Magazine]] at the time.&lt;ref name=Psector&gt;[http://thegreatgeekmanual.com/blog/this-day-in-geek-history-july-12 This Day in Geek History: July12], ''thegreatgeekmanual.com'', retrieved March 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The notorious [[Rusty n Edie's BBS]], in [[Boardman, Ohio|Boardman]], [[Ohio]], was raided by the FBI in January 1993 for software piracy, and in November 1997 sued by [[Playboy]] for copyright infringement. In [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Michigan]], a 21 year old man was charged with distributing [[child pornography]] through his BBS in March 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;flintj&quot;&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2009-03-10|title=Man Says Kiddie Porno Made Computer Site Popular|publisher=[[The Flint Journal]]|date=1996-03-20|author=Doran, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Networks==
Most early BBSes operated as stand-alone islands. Information contained on that BBS never left the system, and users would only interact with the information and user community on that BBS alone. However, as BBSes became more widespread, there evolved a desire to connect systems together to share messages and files with distant systems and users. The largest such network was [[FidoNet]].

As is it was prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist SysOp to have a dedicated connection to another system, FidoNet was developed as a [[store and forward]] network. Private electronic mail (Netmail), public message boards (Echomail) and eventually even file attachments on a FidoNet-capable BBS would be bundled into one or more archive files over a set time interval. These archive files were then compressed with [[ARC (file format)|ARC]] or [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] and forwarded to (or polled by) another nearby node or hub via a dialup [[Xmodem]] session. Messages would be relayed around various FidoNet hubs until they were eventually delivered to their destination. The hierarchy of FidoNet BBS nodes, hubs, and zones was maintained in a routing table called a Nodelist. Some larger BBSes or regional FidoNet hubs would make several transfers per day, some even to multiple nodes or hubs, and as such, transfers usually occurred at night or early morning when toll rates were lowest. In Fido's heyday, sending a Netmail message to a user on a distant FidoNet node, or participating in an Echomail discussion could take days, especially if any FidoNet nodes or hubs in the message's route only made one transfer call per day.

FidoNet was platform-independent and would work with any BBS that was written to use it. BBSes that did not have integrated FidoNet capability could usually add it using an external FidoNet [[front-end]] mailer such as FrontDoor, BinkleyTerm, InterMail or D'Bridge, and a mail processor such as [[FastEcho]] or [[Squish (FidoNet)|Squish]]. The front-end mailer would conduct the periodic FidoNet transfers, while the mail processor would usually run just before and just after the mailer ran. This program would scan for and pack up new outgoing messages, and then unpack, sort and &quot;toss&quot; the incoming messages into a BBS user's local electronic mailbox or into the BBS's local message bases reserved for Echomail. As such, these mail processors were commonly called &quot;scanner/tosser/packers.&quot;

Many other BBS networks followed the example of FidoNet, using the same standards and the same software. These were called '''FidoNet Technology Networks''' (FTNs). They were usually smaller and targeted at selected audiences. Some networks used [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] doors, and others such as [[RelayNet]] (RIME) and [[WWIVnet]] used non-Fido software and standards. 

Before commercial Internet access became common, these [[computer network|networks]] of BBSes provided regional and international [[e-mail]] and message bases. Some even provided [[Gateway (computer networking)|gateways]], such as UFGATE, by which members could send/receive e-mail to/from the [[Internet]] via [[UUCP]], and many FidoNet discussion groups were shared via [[Usenet]]. Elaborate schemes allowed users to download binary files, search [[Gopher (protocol)|gopherspace]], and interact with distant [[Computer program|programs]], all using plain text e-mail. 

As the volume of FidoNet Mail increased and newsgroups from the early days of the Internet became available, satellite data downstream services became viable for larger systems. The satellite service provided access to FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups in large volumes at a reasonable fee. By connecting a small dish &amp; receiver, a constant downstream of thousands of FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups could be received. The local BBS only needed to upload new outgoing messages via the modem network back to the satellite service. This method drastically reduced phone data transfers while dramatically increasing the number of message forums. 

FidoNet is still in use today, though in a much smaller form, and many Echomail groups are still shared with Usenet via FidoNet to Usenet gateways. Widespread abuse of Usenet with [[spam (electronic)|spam]] and [[pornography]] has led to many of these FidoNet gateways to cease operation completely.

==Shareware and freeware==
{{Main|shareware}}
Much of the &quot;[[Shareware]]&quot; movement was started via user distribution of software through BBSes. A notable example was [[Phil Katz]]'s PKARC (and later [[PKZIP]], using the same &quot;.zip&quot; [[algorithm]] that [[WinZip]] and other popular archivers now use); also other concepts of software distribution like [[freeware]], [[postcardware]] like [[JPEGview]] and [[donationware]] like [[Red Ryder (software)|Red Ryder]] for the Macintosh first appeared on BBS sites. [[Doom (video game)|Doom]] from [[id Software]] and many [[3D Realms|Apogee]] games were distributed as shareware. The Internet has largely erased the distinction of shareware - most users now download the software directly from the developer's website rather than receiving it from another BBS user 'sharing' it. Today shareware is commonly used to mean electronically-distributed software from a small developer.

Many commercial BBS software companies that continue to support their old BBS software products switched to the shareware model or made it entirely free. Some companies were able to make the move to the Internet and provide commercial products with BBS capabilities.

==Features==
A classic BBS had:
* A [[computer]]
* One or more [[modem]]s
* One or more phone lines
* A [[List of BBS software|BBS software package]]
* A [[sysop]] - system operator
* A user community

The BBS software usually provides:
* Menu Systems
* One or more [[Message board|message base]]s
* File areas
* SysOp side, live viewing of all caller activity
* Voting - opinion booths
* Statistics on message posters, top uploaders / downloaders
* [[Online game]]s (usually single [[Player (game)|player]] or only a single active player at a given time)
* A [[BBS door|doorway]] to third-party online games
* Usage auditing capabilities
* Multi-user chat (only possible on multi-line BBSes)
* Internet email (more common in later Internet-connected BBSes)
* Networked message boards
* Most modern BBSes allow [[telnet]] access over the Internet using a telnet server and a virtual [[FOSSIL]] driver.
* A &quot;yell for SysOp&quot; (The original chat, before multi-line systems) caller side menu item that sounded an audible alarm to the SysOp. If chosen, the SysOp could then initiate a text-to-text chat with the caller; similar to what commercial websites have used to sell and support products.

'''Blindness''' is the condition of lacking [[visual perception]] due to [[Physiology|physiological]] or [[Neurology|neurological]] factors.

Various scales have been developed to describe the extent of [[vision loss]] and define blindness.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICO&quot;&gt;International Council of Ophthalmology. [http://www.icoph.org/pdf/visualstandardsreport.pdf &quot;International Standards: Visual Standards — Aspects and Ranges of Vision Loss with Emphasis on Population Surveys.&quot;] April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Total blindness''' is the complete lack of form and visual light perception and is clinically recorded as NLP, an abbreviation for &quot;no light perception.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICO&quot;/&gt; ''Blindness'' is frequently used to describe severe [[visual impairment]] with [[wikt:residual|residual]] vision. Those described as having only light perception have no more sight than the ability to tell light from dark and the general direction of a [[light source]].

In order to determine which people may need special assistance because of their visual disabilities, various governmental jurisdictions have formulated more complex definitions referred to as '''legal blindness'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belote&quot;&gt;Belote, Larry. [http://www.larrybelote.com/Files/Low%20Vision%20Education%20and%20Training/Extending%20the%20Boundaries%20of%20Service.DOC &quot;Low Vision Education and Training: Defining the Boundaries of Low Vision Patients.&quot;] ''A Personal Guide to the VA Visual Impairment Services Program.'' Retrieved March 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North America]] and most of [[Europe]], legal blindness is defined as [[visual acuity]] (vision) of 20/200 (6/60) or less in the better eye with best correction possible. This means that a legally blind individual would have to stand {{convert|20|ft|m}} from an object to see it—with [[corrective lens]]es—with the same degree of clarity as a normally sighted person could from {{convert|200|ft|m}}. In many areas, people with average acuity who nonetheless have a [[visual field]] of less than 20 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (the norm being 180 degrees) are also classified as being legally blind.
Approximately ten percent of those deemed legally blind, by any measure, have no vision. The rest have some vision, from light perception alone to relatively good acuity. [[Low vision]] is sometimes used to describe visual acuities from 20/70 to 20/200.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afb.org/Section.asp?SectionID=26&amp;TopicID=144 Living with Low Vision - American Foundation for the Blind&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 10th Revision of the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, ''low vision'' is defined as visual acuity of less than 20/60 (6/18), but equal to or better than 20/200 (6/60), or corresponding visual field loss to less than 20 degrees, in the better eye with best possible correction. ''Blindness'' is defined as visual acuity of less than 20/400 (6/120), or corresponding visual field loss to less than 10 degrees, in the better eye with best possible correction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.who.int/icd/currentversion/fr-icd.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/ WHO | Magnitude and causes of visual impairment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Blind people with undamaged eyes may still register light non-visually for the purpose of [[Circadian rhythm|circadian]] [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] to the 24-hour light/dark cycle. Light signals for this purpose travel through the [[retinohypothalamic tract]], so a damaged optic nerve beyond where the retinohypothalamic tract exits it is no hindrance.

==Classification==&lt;!--&quot;Legally-blind&quot; redirects to this section--&gt;
{{Globalize/USA|section|date=September 2010}}
In 1934, the [[American Medical Association]] adopted the following definition of blindness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with corrective glasses or central visual acuity of more than 20/200 if there is a visual field defect in which the peripheral field is contracted to such an extent that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angular distance no greater than 20 degrees in the better eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koestler&quot;&gt;Koestler, F. A., (1976). ''The unseen minority: a social history of blindness in the United States.'' New York: David McKay.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States Congress]] included this definition as part of the [[Aid to the Blind]] program in the [[Social Security (United States)#Creation: The Social Security Act|Social Security Act]] passed in 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koestler&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Corn&quot;&gt;Corn, AL; Spungin, SJ. [http://www.coe.ufl.edu/copsse/docs/IB-10/1/IB-10.pdf &quot;Free and Appropriate Public Education and the Personnel Crisis for Students with Visual Impairments and Blindness.&quot;] Center on Personnel Studies in Special Education. April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the Aid to the Blind program and two others combined under Title XVI of the Social Security Act to form the [[Supplemental Security Income]] program&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/80chap12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which currently states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An individual shall be considered to be blind for purposes of this title if he has central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a correcting lens. An eye which is accompanied by a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees shall be considered for purposes of the first sentence of this subsection as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less. An individual shall also be considered to be blind for purposes of this title if he is blind as defined under a State plan approved under title X or XVI as in effect for October 1972 and received aid under such plan (on the basis of blindness) for December 1973, so long as he is continuously blind as so defined.&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Act. [http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title16b/1614.htm &quot;Sec. 1614. Meaning of terms.&quot;] Retrieved February 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United States, legal blindness due to acuity loss is most often measured by a regular eye doctor with an eye chart.

Legal blindness due to visual field being less than 20 degrees is measured by a [[visual field test]] using a number IV target size. If the doctor or facility performing the test is approved by the [[Social Security Administration]], this is the official US determination for legal blindness due to field loss in conditions like [[retinitis pigmentosa]].

[[Kuwait]] is one of many nations that share the same criteria for legal blindness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Merjan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Al-Merjan | first1 = JI | last2 = Pandova | first2 = MG | last3 = Al-Ghanim | first3 = M | last4 = Al-Wayel | first4 = A | last5 = Al-Mutairi | first5 = S | title = Registered blindness and low vision in Kuwait | journal = Ophthalmic epidemiology | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 251–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16033746 | doi = 10.1080/09286580591005813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[UK]], the Certificate of Vision Impairment (CVI) is used to certify patients as severely sight impaired or sight impaired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Primarycare/Optical/DH_4074843 &quot;Identification and notification of sight loss&quot;] Retrieved April 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying guidance for clinical staff states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The National Assistance Act 1948 states that a person can be certified as severely sight impaired if they are “so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eye sight is essential” (National Assistance Act Section 64(1)). The test is whether a person cannot do any work for which eyesight is essential, not just his or her normal job or one particular job.&lt;ref name=&quot;dh.gov.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_078294.pdf &quot;Certificate of Vision Impairment: Explanatory Notes for Consultant Ophthalmologists and Hospital Eye Clinic Staff&quot;] retrieved April 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In practice, the definition depends on individuals' [[visual acuity]] and the extent to which their [[field of vision]] is restricted. The [[Department of Health]] identifies three groups of patients who may be classified as severely visually impaired.&lt;ref name=&quot;dh.gov.uk&quot;/&gt;
#Those below 3/60 [[Snellen]] (most people below 3/60 are severely sight impaired),
#Those better than 3/60 but below 6/60 Snellen (people who have a very contracted field of vision only),
#Those 6/60 Snellen or above (people in this group who have a contracted [[field of vision]] especially if the contraction is in the lower part of the field),

The Department of Health also state that a person is more likely to be classified as severely visually impaired if their eyesight has failed recently or if they are an older individual, both groups being perceived as less able to adapt to their vision loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;dh.gov.uk&quot;/&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Caoguia2006.jpg|thumb|A blind man is led by a [[guide dog]] in Brasília, Brazil.]]
Serious visual impairment has a variety of causes:

===Diseases===
According to [[World Health Organization|WHO]] estimates, the most common causes of blindness around the world in 2002 were:
#[[cataract]]s (47.9%),
#[[glaucoma]] (12.3%),
#age-related [[macular degeneration]] (8.7%),
#[[cornea]]l opacity (5.1%), and
#[[diabetic retinopathy]] (4.8%),
#[[childhood blindness]] (3.9%),
#[[trachoma]] (3.6%)
#[[onchocerciasis]] (0.8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/blindness/causes/en/|title=Causes of blindness and visual impairment|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the worldwide prevalence of blindness, the vastly greater number of people in the developing world and the greater likelihood of their being affected mean that the causes of blindness in those areas are numerically more important. Cataract is responsible for more than 22 million cases of blindness and glaucoma 6 million, while leprosy and onchocerciasis each blind approximately 1 million individuals worldwide. The number of individuals blind from trachoma has dropped dramatically in the past 10 years from 6 million to 1.3 million, putting it in seventh place on the list of causes of blindness worldwide. Xerophthalmia is estimated to affect 5 million children each year; 500,000 develop active corneal involvement, and half of these go blind. Central corneal ulceration is also a significant cause of monocular blindness worldwide, accounting for an estimated 850,000 cases of corneal blindness every year in the Indian subcontinent alone. As a result, corneal scarring from all causes now is the fourth greatest cause of global blindness (Vaughan &amp; Asbury's General Ophthalmology, 17e)

People in developing countries are significantly more likely to experience visual impairment as a consequence of treatable or preventable conditions than are their counterparts in the developed world. While vision impairment is most common in people over age 60 across all regions, children in poorer communities are more likely to be affected by blinding diseases than are their more affluent peers.

The link between [[poverty]] and treatable visual impairment is most obvious when conducting regional comparisons of cause. Most adult visual impairment in [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]] is related to age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. While both of these conditions are subject to treatment, neither can be cured.

In developing countries, wherein people have shorter life expectancies, cataracts and water-borne parasites—both of which can be treated effectively—are most often the culprits (see [[Onchocerciasis|river blindness]], for example). Of the estimated 40 million blind people located around the world, 70–80% can have some or all of their sight restored through treatment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In developed countries where parasitic diseases are less common and [[cataract surgery]] is more available, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy are usually the leading causes of blindness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bunce&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bunce | first1 = C | last2 = Wormald | first2 = R | title = Leading causes of certification for blindness and partial sight in England &amp; Wales | journal = BMC public health | volume = 6 | pages = 58 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16524463 | pmc = 1420283 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-6-58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Childhood blindness can be caused by conditions related to pregnancy, such as [[congenital rubella syndrome]] and [[retinopathy of prematurity]].

===Abnormalities and injuries===
Eye injuries, most often occurring in people under 30, are the leading cause of monocular blindness (vision loss in one eye) throughout the [[United States]]. Injuries and cataracts affect the eye itself, while abnormalities such as [[optic nerve hypoplasia]] affect the nerve bundle that sends signals from the eye to the back of the brain, which can lead to decreased visual acuity.

People with injuries to the [[occipital lobe]] of the [[Human brain|brain]] can, despite having undamaged eyes and [[optic nerve]]s, still be legally or totally blind.

===Genetic defects===
People with [[albinism]] often have vision loss to the extent that many are legally blind, though few of them actually cannot see. [[Leber's congenital amaurosis]] can cause total blindness or severe sight loss from birth or early childhood.

Recent advances in [[genetic map|mapping]] of the [[human genome]] have identified other genetic causes of [[low vision]] or blindness. One such example is [[Bardet-Biedl syndrome]].

===Poisoning===
Rarely, blindness is caused by the intake of certain chemicals. A well-known example is [[methanol]], which is only mildly toxic and minimally intoxicating, but when not competing with [[ethanol]] for metabolism, methanol breaks down into the substances [[formaldehyde]] and [[formic acid]] which in turn can cause blindness, an array of other health complications, and death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Methanol&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

Methylated spirits are sometimes used by [[Alcoholism|alcoholics]] as a desperate and cheap substitute for regular ethanol [[alcoholic beverages]].

===Willful actions===
Blinding has been used as an act of vengeance and [[torture]] in some instances, to deprive a person of a major sense by which they can navigate or interact within the world, act fully independently, and be aware of events surrounding them. An example from the classical realm is [[Oedipus]], who gouges out his own eyes after realizing that he fulfilled the awful prophecy spoken of him. Having crushed the Bulgarians, the Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]] blinded as many as 15,000 prisoners taken in the battle, before releasing them.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, George (1856). ''History of the Byzantine Empire from DCCXVI to MLVII'', 2nd Edition, Published by W. Blackwood, p. 444–445.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a Pakistani anti-terrorism court sentenced a man to be blinded after he carried out an acid attack against his fiancee that resulted in her blinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Eye-for-eye in Pakistan acid case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3313207.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=12 December 2003|accessdate=2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same sentence was given in 2009 for the man who blinded [[Ameneh Bahrami]].

==Comorbidities==
Blindness can occur in combination with such conditions as [[mental retardation]], [[autism spectrum disorders]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[hearing impairment]]s, and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lighthouse&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lighthouse.org/about-low-vision-blindness/causes-of-blindness/|title=Causes of Blindness|publisher=Lighthouse International|accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autism&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncecbvi.org/autism.htm|title=Autism and Blindness|publisher=Nerbraska Center for the Education of Children who are Blind or Visually Impaired|accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of 228 visually impaired children in [[Atlanta metropolitan area|metropolitan Atlanta]] between 1991 and 1993, 154 (68%) had an additional disability besides visual impairment.&lt;ref name=&quot;lighthouse&quot;/&gt; Blindness in combination with hearing loss is known as [[deafblindness]].

Med. |volume=358 |issue=21 |pages=2231–9 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18441371 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0802268 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/NEJMoa0802268}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested the effect of using gene therapy to help restore the sight of patients with a rare form of inherited blindness, known as Leber Congenital Amaurosis or LCA. Leber Congenital Amaurosis damages the light receptors in the retina and usually begins affecting sight in early childhood, with worsening vision until complete blindness around the age of 30.

The study used a common cold virus to deliver a normal version of the gene called RPE65 directly into the eyes of affected patients. Remarkably all 3 patients aged 19, 22 and 25 responded well to the treatment and reported improved vision following the procedure. Due to the age of the patients and the degenerative nature of LCA the improvement of vision in gene therapy patients is encouraging for researchers. It is hoped that gene therapy may be even more effective in younger LCA patients who have experienced limited vision loss as well as in other blind or partially blind individuals.

Two experimental treatments for retinal problems include a cybernetic replacement and transplant of fetal retinal cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113968653 Bionic Eye Opens New World Of Sight For Blind] by Jon Hamilton.

==Adaptive techniques and aids==
===Mobility===
[[Image:Long cane folded.jpg|thumb|200px|Folded long cane.]]
Many people with serious visual impairments can travel independently, using a wide range of tools and techniques. Orientation and mobility specialists are professionals who are specifically trained to teach people with visual impairments how to travel safely, confidently, and independently in the home and the community. These professionals can also help blind people to practice travelling on specific routes which they may use often, such as the route from one's house to a convenience store. Becoming familiar with an environment or route can make it much easier for a blind person to navigate successfully.

Tools such as the [[white cane]] with a red tip - the [[international symbols|international symbol]] of blindness - may also be used to improve mobility. A long cane is used to extend the user's range of touch sensation. It is usually swung in a low sweeping motion, across the intended path of travel, to detect obstacles. However, techniques for cane travel can vary depending on the user and/or the situation. Some visually impaired persons do not carry these kinds of canes, opting instead for the shorter, lighter identification (ID) cane. Still others require a support cane. The choice depends on the individual's vision, motivation, and other factors.

A small number of people employ [[guide dog]]s to assist in mobility. These dogs are trained to navigate around various obstacles, and to indicate when it becomes necessary to go up or down a step. However, the helpfulness of guide dogs is limited by the inability of dogs to understand complex directions. The human half of the guide dog team does the directing, based upon skills acquired through previous mobility training. In this sense, the handler might be likened to an aircraft's navigator, who must know how to get from one place to another, and the dog to the pilot, who gets them there safely.

Some blind people use [[GPS for the visually impaired]] as a mobility aid. Such software can assist blind people with orientation and navigation, but it is not a replacement for traditional mobility tools such as white canes and guide dogs.

Technology to allow blind people to drive motor vehicles is currently being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110128/ap_on_re_us/us_blind_driver|title=Blind driver to debut new technologies at Daytona|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=28 January 2011|accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government actions are sometimes taken to make public places more accessible to blind people. Public transportation is freely available to the blind in many cities. [[Tactile paving]] and audible traffic signals can make it easier and safer for visually impaired pedestrians to cross streets. In addition to making rules about who can and cannot use a cane, some governments mandate the [[Traffic#Priority (right of way)|right-of-way]] be given to users of white canes or guide dogs.

===Reading and magnification===
[[Image:Watch for the blind2.jpg|thumb|[[Braille watch]]]]
Most visually impaired people who are not totally blind read print, either of a regular size or enlarged by magnification devices. Many also read [[large-print]], which is easier for them to read without such devices. A variety of [[magnifying glass]]es, some handheld, and some on desktops, can make reading easier for them.

Others read [[Braille]] (or the infrequently used [[Moon type]]), or rely on [[audiobook|talking books]] and readers or [[reading machine]]s, which convert printed text to speech or [[Braille]]. They use computers with special hardware such as [[image scanner|scanners]] and [[refreshable Braille display]]s as well as software written specifically for the blind, such as [[optical character recognition]] applications and [[screen reader]]s.

Some people access these materials through agencies for the blind, such as the [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]] in the United States, the [[National Library for the Blind]] or the [[Royal National Institute for the Blind|RNIB]] in the United Kingdom.

[[Closed-circuit television]]s, equipment that enlarges and contrasts textual items, are a more [[high-tech]] alternative to traditional magnification devices.

There are also over 100 [[radio reading service]]s throughout the world that provide people with vision impairments with readings from periodicals over the radio. The International Association of Audio Information Services provides links to all of these organizations.

===Computers===
Access technology such as [[screen reader]]s, [[screen magnifier]]s and [[refreshable Braille display]]s enable the blind to use mainstream computer applications and [[mobile phone]]s. The availability of assistive technology is increasing, accompanied by concerted efforts to ensure the accessibility of information technology to all potential users, including the blind. Later versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] include an Accessibility Wizard &amp; Magnifier for those with partial vision, and [[Microsoft Narrator]], a simple screen reader. [[Linux distribution]]s (as [[live CD]]s) for the blind include [[Oralux]] and [[Adriane Knoppix]], the latter developed in part by [[Klaus Knopper|Adriane Knopper]] who has a visual impairment. Mac OS also comes with a built-in screen reader, called [[VoiceOver]].

The movement towards greater [[web accessibility]] is opening a far wider number of websites to [[adaptive technology]], making the web a more inviting place for visually impaired surfers.

Experimental approaches in [[sensory substitution]] are beginning to provide access to arbitrary live views from a [[camera]].

Modified visual output that includes large print and/or clear simple graphics can be of benefit to users with some residual vision.&lt;ref name=&quot;dynamicdiversity&quot;&gt;Gregor, P., Newell, A.F., Zajicek, M. (2002).  Designing for Dynamic Diversity – interfaces for older people. Proceedings of the fifth international ACM conference on Assistive technologies.  Edinburgh, Scotland.  Session: Solutions for aging.  Pages 151–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other aids and techniques===
[[Image:Banknote feature.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Canadian currency tactile feature|tactile feature]] on a [[Canadian banknotes|Canadian banknote]].]]
Blind people may use talking equipment such as [[thermometer]]s, watches, clocks, [[weighing scale|scales]], [[calculator]]s, and [[compass]]es. They may also enlarge or mark dials on devices such as ovens and thermostats to make them usable. Other techniques used by blind people to assist them in daily activities include:

*Adaptations of [[coin]]s and [[banknote]]s so that the value can be determined by touch. For example:
** In some currencies, such as the [[euro]], the [[pound sterling]] and the [[Indian rupee]], the size of a note increases with its value.
** On US coins, pennies and dimes, and nickels and quarters are similar in size. The larger denominations (dimes and quarters) have ridges along the sides (historically used to prevent the &quot;shaving&quot; of precious metals from the coins), which can now be used for identification.
** Some currencies' [[banknotes]] have a tactile feature to indicate denomination. For example, the [[Canadian currency tactile feature]] is a system of raised dots in one corner, based on Braille cells but not standard [[Braille]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/accessibility.html Accessibility features - Bank Notes - Bank of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;
** It is also possible to fold notes in different ways to assist recognition.
*Labeling and tagging clothing and other personal items
*Placing different types of food at different positions on a dinner plate
*Marking controls of household appliances

Most people, once they have been visually impaired for long enough, devise their own adaptive strategies in all areas of personal and professional management.

==Epidemiology==
The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] estimates that in 2002 there were 161 million visually impaired people in the world (about 2.6% of the total population). Of this number 124 million (about 2%) had low vision and 37 million (about 0.6%) were blind.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = World Health Organization | work =| publisher = [[World Health Organization]]| year = 2006| url = http://www.who.int/en/| format = Web| doi =| accessdate=December 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order of frequency the leading causes were [[cataract]], uncorrected [[refractive errors]] ([[near sighted]], [[far sighted]], or an [[astigmatism]]), [[glaucoma]], and [[age-related macular degeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; Visual impairment and blindness |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1987, it was estimated that 598,000 people in the United States met the legal definition of blindness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirchner&quot;&gt;Kirchner, C., Stephen, G. &amp; Chandu, F.

==Society and culture==
===In literature and the arts===
[[image:El Greco 015.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Miracle of Christ Healing the Blind]] by [[El Greco]], c. 1570]]

{{see also|Blindness in literature}}
In Greek myth, [[Tiresias]] was a prophet famous for his [[clairvoyance]]. According to one myth, he was blinded by the Gods as punishment for revealing their secrets, while another holds that he was blinded as punishment after he saw Athena naked while she was bathing. In [[the Odyssey]], the one-eyed Cyclops [[Polyphemus]] captures [[Odysseus]], who blinds Polyphemus in order to escape. In Norse mythology, [[Loki]] tricks the blind God [[Höðr]] into killing his brother [[Baldr]], the God of happiness. 

The [[Bible]] contains numerous instances of [[Miracles of Jesus|Jesus performing miracles]] to heal the blind. According to the Gospels, Jesus healed [[Healing the two blind men in Galilee|the two blind men of Galilee]], [[Blind man of Bethsaida|the blind man of Bethsaida]], [[Healing the blind near Jericho|the blind man of Jericho]] and [[Healing the blind at birth|the man who was born blind]]. 

The parable of the [[blind men and an elephant]] has crossed between many religious traditions and is part of [[Jainism|Jain]], [[Buddhist]], [[Sufi]] and [[Hindu]] lore. In various versions of the tale, a group of blind men (or men in the dark) touch an [[elephant]] to learn what it is like. Each one feels a different part, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then compare notes and learn that they are in complete disagreement.

[[File:Velazquez Niewidoma.jpg|left|thumbnail|Portrait of a ''Blind woman'' by [[Diego Velázquez]].]]

Poet [[John Milton]], who went blind in mid-life, composed [[On His Blindness]], a sonnet about coping with blindness. The work posits that ''[those] who best Bear [God]'s mild yoke, they serve him best.'' 

Slaver-turned-abolitionist [[John Newton]] composed the hymn [[Amazing Grace]] about a wretch who ''&quot;once was lost, but now am found, Was blind, but now I see.&quot;'' Blindness, in this sense, is used both metaphorically (to refer to someone who was ignorant but later became knowledgeable) and literally, as a reference to those healed in the Bible. In the later years of his life, Newton himself would go blind.

&quot;[[Three Blind Mice]]&quot; is a medieval [[English language|English]] [[nursery rhyme]] about three blind mice whose tails are cut off after chasing the farmer's wife. The work is explicitly incongruous, ending with the comment ''Did you ever see such a sight in your life, As three blind mice?''

[[Bob Dylan]]'s anti-war song &quot;[[Blowin' in the Wind]]&quot; twice alludes to metaphorical blindness: ''How many times can a man turn his head // and pretend that he just doesn't see... How many times must a man look up // Before he can see the sky?''

[[File:José de Ribera 018.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[The Sense of Touch]] by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] depicts a blind man holding a marble head in his hands.]] 

Contemporary fiction contains numerous well-known [[:Category:Fictional blind characters|blind characters]]. Some of these characters can &quot;see&quot; by means of fictitious devices, such as the [[Marvel]] comic superhero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], who can &quot;see&quot; via his super-human hearing acuity, or ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Geordi La Forge]], who can see with the aid of a [[VISOR]], a fictitious device that transmits optical signals to his brain.

===Sports===
Blind and partially sighted people participate in sports such as [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[snow skiing]] and [[athletics (sport)|athletics]]. Some sports have been invented or adapted for the blind such as [[goalball]], [[Paralympic association football|association football]], [[blind cricket|cricket]], and [[blind golf|golf]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vicsports&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blindsports.org.au/|title=Blind Sports Victoria|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide authority on sports for the blind is the [[International Blind Sports Federation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Para&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/paralympian/20014/2001430.htm|title=IBSA General Assembly Elects New Leadership|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|work=The Paralympian|month=April | year=2001|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with vision impairments have participated in the [[Paralympic Games]] since the [[1976 Summer Paralympics|1976 summer Paralympics in Toronto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;disserv&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=The history of people with disabilities in Australia - 100 years|publisher=Disability Services Australia|url=http://www.dsa.org.au/life_site/text/sport/index.html|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphorical uses===
The word &quot;blind&quot; (adjective and verb) is often used to signify a lack of knowledge of something. For example, a blind date is a date in which the people involved have not previously met; a [[blind experiment]] is one in which information is kept from either the experimenter or the participant in order to mitigate the [[placebo effect]] or [[observer bias]]. The expression &quot;blind leading the blind&quot; refers to incapable people leading other incapable people. Being blind to something means not understanding or being aware of it. A &quot;[[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]]&quot; is an area where someone cannot see, for example, where a car driver cannot see because parts of his car's bodywork are in the way.

==In other animals==
{{Main|Blind animals}}
Statements that certain species of [[mammal]]s are &quot;born blind&quot; refers to them being born with their eyes closed and their eyelids fused together; the eyes open later. One example is the [[rabbit]]. In humans the eyelids are fused for a while before birth, but open again before the normal birth time, but very premature babies are sometimes born with their eyes fused shut, and opening later. Other animals such as the [[blind mole rat]] are truly blind and rely on other senses.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The theme of blind animals has been a powerful one in literature. [[Peter Schaffer]]'s Tony-Award winning play, [[Equus (play)|Equus]], tells the story of a boy who blinds six horses. [[Theodore Taylor (author)|Theodore Taylor]]'s classic young adult novel, ''[[The Trouble With Tuck]],'' is about a teenage girl, Helen, who trains her blind dog to follow and trust a seeing-eye dog.

[[Image:Ninth Symphony original.png|thumb|200 px|A page from Beethoven's manuscript of the 9th Symphony.]]

The '''Symphony No. 9 in D minor: ''Choral'', [[Opus number|Op.]] 125''', is the final complete [[symphony]] of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. Completed in 1824, the symphony is one of the best known works of the Western classical repertoire,&lt;ref name=NCookblurb&gt;''Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 (Cambridge Music Handbooks)'', Nicholas Cook, Cambridge University Press (24 Jun 1993), product description (blurb).&lt;/ref&gt; and has been adapted for use as the [[European Anthem]]. It is considered by critics to be one of Beethoven's masterpieces&lt;ref&gt;''The Symphony'', ed. Ralph Hill, Pelican Books (1949), pg.114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Symphony No. 6 in F Major'', Op. 68 Pastorale (Schott), ed. Max Unger, pg. vii&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the greatest musical compositions ever written.&lt;ref name=NCookblurb/&gt;

The symphony was the first example of a major composer using voices in a symphony (thus making it a [[choral symphony]]). The words are sung during the final movement by four vocal soloists and a [[choir|chorus]]. They were taken from the &quot;[[Ode to Joy]]&quot;, a poem written by [[Friedrich Schiller]] in 1785 and revised in 1803, with additions made by the composer.

==History==
===Composition===
[[Image:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Ludwig van Beethoven in 1820. Beethoven was completely deaf when he composed his ninth symphony.]]

The [[Philharmonic Society of London]] originally commissioned the symphony in 1817. Beethoven started the work in 1818 and finished early in 1824. However, both the words and notes of the symphony have sources dating from earlier in Beethoven's career.

The title of Schiller's poem &lt;em lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;&quot;An die Freude&quot;&lt;/em&gt; is literally translated as &quot;To Joy&quot;, but is normally called the ''&quot;[[Ode to Joy]]&quot;''. It was written in 1785 and first published the following year in the poet's own literary journal, ''Talia''. Beethoven had made plans to set this poem to music as far back as 1793, when he was 22 years old.

Beethoven's sketchbooks show that bits of musical material that ultimately appeared in the symphony were written in 1811, and 1817.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In addition, the symphony also emerged from other pieces by Beethoven that, while completed works in their own right, are also in some sense sketches for the future symphony. The [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]] Opus. 80 (1808), basically a piano concerto movement, brings in a chorus and vocal soloists near the end to form the climax. As in the Ninth Symphony, the vocal forces sing a theme first played instrumentally, and this theme is highly reminiscent of the corresponding theme in the Ninth Symphony (for a detailed comparison, see [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]]). Going further back, an earlier version of the Choral Fantasy theme is found in the song &quot;Gegenliebe&quot; (&quot;Returned Love&quot;), for piano and high voice, which dates from before 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins (1981, 249)&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme for the scherzo can be traced back to a [[fugue]] written in 1815.

The introduction for the vocal part of the symphony caused many difficulties for Beethoven. Beethoven's friend [[Anton Schindler]], later said: &quot;When he started working on the fourth movement the struggle began as never before. The aim was to find an appropriate way of introducing Schiller's ode. One day he [Beethoven] entered the room and shouted 'I got it, I just got it!' Then he showed me a sketchbook with the words 'let us sing the ode of the immortal Schiller'&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} However, Beethoven did not retain this version, and kept rewriting until he had found its final form, with the words &lt;em lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;&quot;O Freunde, nicht diese Töne&quot;&lt;/em&gt; (&quot;O friends, not these sounds&quot;).

===Premiere===
Beethoven was eager to have his work played in Berlin as soon as possible after finishing it, since he thought that musical taste in Vienna was dominated by Italian composers such as [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]. When his friends and financiers heard this, they urged him to premiere the symphony in [[Vienna]].

The Ninth Symphony was premiered on May 7, 1824 in the [[Kärntnertortheater]] in Vienna, along with the ''[[Consecration of the House Overture]]'' and the first three parts of the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]''. This was the composer's first on-stage appearance in 12 years; the hall was packed. The [[soprano]] and [[alto]] parts were interpreted by two famous young singers: [[Henriette Sontag]] and [[Caroline Unger]].

Although the performance was officially directed by [[Michael Umlauf]], the theatre's [[Kapellmeister]], Beethoven shared the stage with him. However, two years earlier, Umlauf had watched as the composer's attempt to conduct a [[dress rehearsal]] of his opera ''[[Fidelio]]'' ended in disaster. So this time, he instructed the singers and musicians to ignore the totally deaf Beethoven. At the beginning of every part, Beethoven, who sat by the stage, gave the [[tempo]]s. He was turning the pages of his [[sheet music|score]] and beating time for an [[orchestra]] he could not hear.

There are a number of anecdotes about the premiere of the Ninth. Based on the testimony of the participants, there are suggestions that it was under-rehearsed (there were only two full rehearsals) and rather scrappy in execution. On the other hand, the premiere was a great success. In any case, Beethoven was not to blame, as violinist [[Josef Böhm]] recalled: &quot;Beethoven directed the piece himself; that is, he stood before the lectern and gesticulated furiously. At times he rose, at other times he shrank to the ground, he moved as if he wanted to play all the instruments himself and sing for the whole chorus. All the musicians minded his rhythm alone while playing&quot;.

When the audience applauded&amp;mdash;testimonies differ over whether at the end of the [[scherzo]] or the whole symphony&amp;mdash;Beethoven was several measures off and still conducting. Because of that, the [[contralto]] Caroline Unger walked over and turned Beethoven around to accept the audience's cheers and applause. According to one witness, &quot;the public received the musical hero with the utmost respect and sympathy, listened to his wonderful, gigantic creations with the most absorbed attention and broke out in jubilant applause, often during sections, and repeatedly at the end of them.&quot; The whole audience acclaimed him through [[standing ovation]]s five times; there were handkerchiefs in the air, hats, raised hands, so that Beethoven, who could not hear the applause, could at least see the ovation gestures.

At that time, it was customary that the Imperial couple be greeted with three ovations when they entered the hall. The fact that five ovations were received by a private person who was not even employed by the state, and moreover, was a musician (a class of people who had been perceived as lackeys at court), was in itself considered almost indecent. Police agents present at the concert had to break off this spontaneous explosion of ovations. Beethoven left the concert deeply moved.

The repeat performance on May 23 in the great hall of the Fort was, however, poorly attended.
&lt;!-- removing &quot;teaser&quot; that tempts us but doesn't offer anything substantial. Please don't put back until it can be fleshed out:
There was much negative criticism of the symphony and its &quot;dissonances&quot; at the time.

===Editions===
The [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] edition dating from 1864 has been used widely by orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/review/02-99b/24-delmar.html|publisher=British Academy Review|author=Del Mar, Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Del Mar|year=1999|month=July–December|title=Jonathan Del Mar, New Urtext Edition: Beethoven Symphonies 1-9|accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 [[Bärenreiter]] published an edition by [[Jonathan Del Mar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baerenreiter.com/html/lvb/index.html|title=Ludwig van Beethoven The Nine Symphonies The New Bärenreiter Urtext Edition|accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Del Mar, this edition corrects nearly 3000 mistakes in the Breitkopf edition, some of which were remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benjaminzander.com/news/detail.asp?id=158|title=Beethoven 9 The fundamental reappraisal of a classic|author=Zander, Benjamin|authorlink=Benjamin Zander|accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[David Benjamin Levy|David Levy]], however, criticized this edition in [[Beethoven Forum]], saying that it could create &quot;quite possibly false&quot; traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://bf.press.uiuc.edu/10.1/delmar.html|title=Concerning the Review of the Urtext Edition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breitkopf also published a new edition by [[Peter Hauschild]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.breitkopf.com/downloads/kataloge/pdf_en/33_Beeth_Symph_en.pdf|title=Beethoven The Nine Symphonies}}{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many of the modifications in the newer editions make minor alterations to dynamics and articulation, both editions change the orchestral lead-in to the final statement of the choral theme in the fourth movement (IV: m525&amp;nbsp;m542). The newer versions alter the articulation of the horn calls, creating syncopation that no longer relates to the previous motive. The new [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] and [[Bärenreiter]] make this alteration differently, but the result is a reading that is different from what was commonly accepted based on the 1864 Breitkopf edition. While both [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] and [[Bärenreiter]] consider their editions the most accurate versions available&amp;mdash;labeling them [[Urtext edition]]s&amp;mdash;their conclusions are not universally accepted. In his monograph &quot;Beethoven&amp;mdash;the ninth symphony&quot;, Professor [[David Benjamin Levy|David Levy]] describes the rationale for these changes and the danger of calling the editions Urtext.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for the following orchestra. These are by far the largest forces needed for any Beethoven symphony; at the premiere, Beethoven augmented them further by assigning two players to each wind part.

==Form==
The symphony is in four movements, marked as follows:
# Allegro ma non troppo, un poco [[maestoso]]
# Scherzo: Molto [[vivace]] - Presto
# Adagio molto e [[cantabile]] - Andante Moderato - Tempo Primo - Andante Moderato - Adagio - Lo Stesso Tempo
# [[Recitative]]: (Presto – Allegro ma non troppo – Vivace – Adagio cantabile – Allegro assai – Presto: ''O Freunde'') – Allegro assai: ''Freude, schöner Götterfunken'' – Alla marcia – Allegro assai vivace: ''Froh, wie seine Sonnen'' – Andante maestoso: ''Seid umschlungen, Millionen!'' – Adagio ma non troppo, ma divoto: ''Ihr, stürzt nieder'' – Allegro energico, sempre ben [[marcato]]: (''Freude, schöner Götterfunken'' – ''Seid umschlungen, Millionen!'') – Allegro ma non tanto: ''Freude, Tochter aus Elysium!'' – Prestissimo, Maestoso, Molto Prestissimo: ''Seid umschlungen, Millionen!''

Beethoven changes the usual pattern of [[Classical music era|Classical]] symphonies in placing the [[scherzo]] movement before the slow movement (in symphonies, slow movements are usually placed before scherzi). This was the first time that he did this in a symphony, although he had done so in some previous works (including the [[string quartet|quartets]] Op. 18 no. 5, the &quot;Archduke&quot; [[piano trio]] Op. 97, the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|&quot;Hammerklavier&quot;]] piano sonata Op. 106). [[Haydn]], too, had used this arrangement in a number of works.

===First movement===
Allegro ma non troppo, un poco [[maestoso]]. Duration approx. 15 mins.

The first movement is in [[sonata form]], and the mood is often stormy. The opening theme, played ''pianissimo'' over string tremolos, so much resembles the sound of an [[orchestra]] tuning, many commentators have suggested that was Beethoven's inspiration. But from within that musical limbo emerges a theme of power and clarity which will drive the entire movement. Later, at the outset of the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] section, it returns ''fortissimo'' in D major, rather than the opening's D minor. The introduction also employs the use of the mediant to tonic relationship which further distorts the tonic key until it is finally played by the bassoon in the lowest possible register.

The coda employs the [[chromatic fourth]] interval.

===Second movement===
Scherzo: Molto vivace - Presto. Duration approx. 10 mins.

The second movement, a [[scherzo]], is also in D minor, with the opening theme bearing a passing resemblance to the opening theme of the first movement, a pattern also found in the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|Hammerklavier]] piano sonata, written a few years earlier. It uses propulsive rhythms and a [[timpani]] solo. At times during the piece Beethoven directs that the beat should be one downbeat every three bars, perhaps because of the very fast pace of the majority of the movement which is written in triple time, with the direction ''ritmo di tre battute'' (&quot;rhythm of three bars&quot;), and one beat every four bars with the direction ''ritmo di quattro battute'' (&quot;rhythm of four bars&quot;).

Beethoven had been criticised before for failing to adhere to standard form for his compositions. He used this movement to answer his critics. Normally, scherzi are written in triple time. Beethoven wrote this piece in triple time, but it is punctuated in a way that, when coupled with the speed of the metre, makes it sound as though it is in quadruple time.{{fact|date=May 2011}}

While adhering to the standard ternary design of a dance movement (scherzo-trio-scherzo, or minuet-trio-minuet), the scherzo section has an elaborate internal structure: it is a complete sonata form. Within this sonata form, the first group of the exposition starts out with a [[fugue]].

The contrasting trio section is in D major and in duple time. The trio is the first time the [[trombone]]s play in the work.

===Third movement===
Adagio molto e cantabile - Andante Moderato - Tempo Primo - Andante Moderato - Adagio - Lo Stesso Tempo. Duration approx. 16 mins.

{{sample box end}}
--&gt;
The lyrical slow movement, in B flat major, is in a loose [[variation (music)|variation]] form, with each pair of variations progressively elaborating the rhythm and melody. The first variation, like the theme, is in 4/4 time, the second in 12/8. The variations are separated by passages in 3/4, the first in D major, the second in G major. The final variation is twice interrupted by episodes in which loud fanfares for the full orchestra are answered by octaves played by the first violins alone. A prominent [[horn (instrument)|horn]] solo is assigned to the fourth player. [[Trombone]]s are [[tacet]] for the movement.

===Fourth movement===
Presto; Allegro molto assai (Alla marcia); Andante maestoso; Allegro energico, sempre ben marcato. Duration approx. 24 mins.

The famous choral finale is Beethoven's musical representation of Universal Brotherhood. American pianist and music author [[Charles Rosen]] has characterized it as a symphony within a symphony, the view which will be followed below. It is important to note that many other writers have interpreted its form in different terms, including two of the greatest analysts of the twentieth century, [[Heinrich Schenker]] and [[Donald Tovey]]. In Rosen's view, it contains four movements played without interruption.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Charles. &quot;The Classical Style: Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven&quot;. page 440. New York: Norton, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;inner symphony&quot; follows the same overall pattern as the Ninth Symphony as a whole. The scheme is as follows:

*First &quot;movement&quot;: theme and variations with slow introduction. Main theme which first appears in the cellos and basses is later &quot;recapitulated&quot; with voices.
*Second &quot;movement&quot;: 6/8 scherzo in military style (begins at &quot;Alla marcia,&quot; words &quot;Froh, wie seine Sonnen fliegen&quot;), in the &quot;[[Turkish music (style)|Turkish style]]&quot;. Concludes with 6/8 variation of the main theme with chorus.
*Third &quot;movement&quot;: slow meditation with a new theme on the text &quot;Seid umschlungen, Millionen!&quot; (begins at &quot;[[Andante]] maestoso&quot;)
*Fourth &quot;movement&quot;: [[fugue|fugato]] finale on the themes of the first and third &quot;movements&quot; (begins at &quot;[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] energico&quot;)

The movement has a thematic unity, in which every part may be shown to be based on either the main theme, the &quot;Seid umschlungen&quot; theme, or some combination of the two.

The first &quot;movement within a movement&quot; itself is organized into sections:

*An introduction, which starts with a stormy ''[[Presto (music)|Presto]]'' passage. It then briefly quotes all three of the previous movements in order, each dismissed by the cellos and basses which then play in an instrumental foreshadowing of the vocal [[recitative]]. At the introduction of the main theme, the cellos and basses take it up and play it through.
*The main theme forms the basis of a series of [[variation (music)|variations]] for orchestra alone.
*The introduction is then repeated from the ''Presto'' passage, this time with the bass soloist singing the recitatives previously suggested by cellos and basses.
*The main theme again undergoes variations, this time for vocal soloists and chorus.

The full libretto including repetitions can be found on German Wikisource.&lt;ref name=&quot;dew&quot;&gt;Wikisource, de.wikisource.org, web: [http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/An_die_Freude_%28Beethoven%29 WS-Freude].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the near ending, it is, &quot;''Freude, Tochter aus Elysium''&quot;, and also in the near ending, &quot;''Wir betreten feuertrunken, Himmlische, dein Heiligtum!''&quot;, is omitted, then the choir sings the last four lines of the main theme, where they stop at, &quot;''Alle Menschen''&quot;, before the slow part when the soloists sing for one last time the song of joy.

In the ending climax, the chorus softens quietly on the word &quot;''Götterfunken''&quot;. Then, the orchestra descends chords in arpeggio form, and in slow ''[[maestoso]]'' tempo, the full chorus sings, ''&quot;Tochter aus Elysium, Freude, schöner Götterfunken, Götterfunken!&quot;''.&lt;ref name=dew/&gt; The symphony ends with the orchestra playing the final section in [[prestissimo]] tempo.

The vocal part of Beethoven's 9th Symphony thus ends with the final word&lt;ref name=dew/&gt; &quot;''Götterfunken''&quot; (literally, &quot;Godly-spark&quot;).

==Influence==
Many later composers of the Romantic period and beyond were influenced specifically by Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

At Easter 1831 [[Richard Wagner]] completed a piano arrangement of Beethoven's 9th symphony. Wagner had to decide which instrumental lines in the original had to be omitted since the pianist cannot play all the orchestral parts, thus giving his reduction a personal signature.

An important theme in the finale of Johannes Brahms' [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 1 in C minor]] is related to the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; theme from the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth symphony. When this was pointed out to [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], he is reputed to have retorted &quot;Any ass can see that!&quot;, which suggests the imitation was intentional. Brahms's first symphony was, at times, both praised and derided as &quot;Beethoven's Tenth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=2650 Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 68]. The Kennedy Center, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anton Bruckner]] used the [[chromatic fourth]] in his [[Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)|third symphony]] in much the same way that Beethoven used it in the first movement's coda.

Similarly, [[Gustav Mahler]] echoes the texture and mood of the first movement's opening in the opening of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)|first symphony]].

In the opening notes of the third movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|Symphony No. 9]] (The &quot;New World&quot;), [[Antonín Dvořák]] pays homage to the [[scherzo]] of this symphony with his falling fourths and timpani strokes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Steinberg, Michael]]. ''The Symphony: a listeners guide''. page 153. Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hymn, &quot;[[Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee]]&quot;, with words written in 1907 by [[Henry van Dyke]], is sung to the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; tune and is included in many hymnals, although not in the original key of D major.

Beethoven's Ninth Symphony was an influence on the development of the [[compact disc]]. [[Philips]], the company that had started the work on the new audio format, originally planned for a CD to have a diameter of &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;11.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;/span&gt;, the width of the then popular [[compact cassette]], while [[Sony]] planned a &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;10&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;/span&gt; diameter, even more compact but enough for one hour of music.  However, according to a Philips website, [[Norio Ohga]] insisted in 1979 that the CD be able to contain a complete performance of the Ninth Symphony: {{quote|The longest known performance lasted 74 minutes. This was a mono recording made during the [[Bayreuth Festival|Bayreuther Festspiele]] in 1951 and conducted by [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]]. This therefore became the playing time of a CD. A diameter of 12 centimeters was required for this playing time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080129201342/www.research.philips.com/newscenter/dossier/optrec/beethoven.html Optical Recording: Beethoven's Ninth Symphony of greater importance than technology (cache)], Philips&lt;/ref&gt;}}
That said, the true story might have been less romantic: [[Kees Immink]], Philips' chief engineer, who developed the CD, recalls that a commercial [[tug-of-war]] between the development partners led to a settlement in a neutral 12-cm diameter format. The 1951 performance of the Ninth Symphony by Furtwängler was brought forward as the perfect excuse for the change.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferguscassidy&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ferguscassidy.ie/ethos-23-Oct-2005.html | title = Great Lengths | last = Cassidy | first = Fergus | format = reprint | publisher = ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'' | date = 2005-10-23| accessdate = 2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Immink2&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.exp-math.uni-essen.de/~immink/pdf/beethoven.htm|title=Shannon, Beethoven, and the Compact Disc|author=Kees A.

==Performance challenges==
===Duration===
Lasting more than an hour, the Ninth was an exceptionally long symphony for its time. Like much of Beethoven's later music, his Ninth Symphony is demanding for all the performers, including the choir and soloists.

===Metronome markings===
As with all of his symphonies, Beethoven has provided his own [[metronome]] markings for the Ninth Symphony, and as with all of his metronome markings, there is controversy among conductors regarding the degree to which they should be followed. Historically, conductors have tended to take a slower tempo than Beethoven marked for the slow movement, and a faster tempo for the military march section of the finale. Conductors in the [[historically informed performance]] movement, notably [[Roger Norrington]], have used Beethoven's suggested tempos, to mixed reviews.

====Ritard/a tempo at the end of the first movement====
Many conductors move the &quot;a tempo&quot; in m.511 of the first movement to measure m.513 to coincide with the &quot;Funeral March&quot;.

===Re-orchestrations and alterations===
A number of conductors have made alterations in the instrumentation of the symphony.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

====Mahler's retouching====
[[Gustav Mahler]] revised the orchestration of the Ninth to make it sound like what he believed Beethoven would have wanted if given a modern orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natalie Bauer-Lechner|Bauer-Lechner, Natalie]]: ''Erinnerungen an Gustav Mahler'', page 131. E.P. Tal &amp; Co. Verlag, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; For example, since the modern orchestra has larger string sections than in Beethoven's time, Mahler doubled various wind and brass parts to preserve the balance between strings on the one hand and winds and brass on the other.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

====Horn and trumpet alterations====
Beethoven's writing for horns and trumpets throughout the symphony (mostly the 2nd horn and 2nd trumpet) is sometimes altered by performers to avoid large leaps (those of a 12th or more), as leaps of this sort are very difficult to perform on brass instruments and may be consistently and flawlessly executed only by highly proficient musicians.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

====Flute and first violin alterations====
In the first movement, at times the first violins and flute have ascending 7th leaps within mostly descending melodic phrases. Some conductors alter the register of these passages to create a single descending scale (examples: measure 143 in the flute, m. 501 in the first violins).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}{{Clarify|date=October 2010}}

====2nd bassoon doubling basses in the finale====
Beethoven's indication that the 2nd bassoon should double the basses in measures 115-164 of the finale was not included in the Breitkopf parts, though it was included in the score.&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar, Jonathan (1981) ''Orchestral Variations: Confusion and Error in the Orchestral Repertoire'' London: Eulenburg Books, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clarify|date=April 2011}}

==Notable performances and recordings==
{{Ref improve section|date=November 2009}}

The first recording of the Symphony appears to the one conducted by Bruno Seidler-Winkler in 1923. The soloists are Ethel Hansa, Eleanor Schlosshauer, Eugen Transky &amp; Albert Fisher, with the Berlin State Opera Chorus and the New Symphony Orchestra of Berlin. It was issued on Grammaphon 69607-69613, and was recently{{when|date=March 2011}} re-issued at www.historic-recordings.co.uk

Other early recordings include two by Albert Coates, and one by Frieder Weissmann.

[[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] conducted the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] on April 19, 1942 in a performance of the work, on the eve of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s 53rd birthday. This is now available as a semi-private recording.

The [[London Philharmonic Choir]] débuted on 15 May 1947 performing the Ninth Symphony with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] under the baton of [[Victor De Sabata]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref name='debut'&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/933316 | title= London Concerts | journal=The Musical Times | volume= 88 |issue = 1250 | author=Anon. | month=April| year=1947 | pages=139 | publisher=Musical Times Publications Ltd. | jstor=933316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 Furtwängler and the [[Bayreuth Festival]] Orchestra reopened the Bayreuth Festival with a performance of the symphony, after the Allies temporarily suspended the Festival following the Second World War.

After rejecting many performances that he conducted, [[Arturo Toscanini]] approved the release of the 1952 LP studio recording of the symphony he made for [[RCA Victor]]. Soloists were [[Jan Peerce]] (tenor), [[Eileen Farrell]] (soprano), [[Nan Merriman]] (mezzo) and [[Norman Scott (bass)]], with the [[Robert Shaw Chorale]], and Toscanini conducting the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]].

The first stereo recording of the Ninth Symphony was by [[Ferenc Fricsay]] conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in 1958.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Political significance has attached to Beethoven's Ninth: [[Leonard Bernstein]] conducted a version of the 9th, with &quot;Freiheit&quot; (&quot;Freedom&quot;) replacing &quot;Freude&quot; (&quot;Joy&quot;), to celebrate the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] during Christmas 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Morin (2002), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; This concert was performed by an orchestra and chorus made up of many nationalities: from Germany, the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]] and Chorus, the Chorus of the [[Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (East Berlin)|Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra]], and members of the [[Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden]]; from the [[Soviet Union]], members of the Orchestra of the [[Kirov Theatre]], from the United Kingdom, members of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]; from the USA, members of the [[New York Philharmonic]], and from France, members of the [[Orchestre de Paris]]. Soloists were [[June Anderson]], soprano, [[Sarah Walker (opera singer)|Sarah Walker]], mezzo-soprano, [[Klaus König]], tenor, and [[Jan-Hendrik Rootering]], bass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Naxos 2072038&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=2072038 |title=Ode To Freedom - Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 (NTSC)|accessdate=2006-11-26 |author=Naxos |authorlink=Naxos Records |year=2006 |work=Naxos.com Classical Music Catalogue}} This is the publisher's catalogue entry for a DVD of Bernstein's Christmas 1989 &quot;Ode to Freedom&quot; concert.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernstein made his first recording of the Beethoven Ninth in 1964 with the New York Philharmonic, for [[Columbia Masterworks]], with soloists [[Martina Arroyo]] (soprano), [[Regina Safarty]] (mezzo), [[Nicholas di Virgilio]] (tenor), Norman Scott (bass), and the [[Juilliard]] Chorus. It was later reissued on CD. It was the first of three complete recordings of the Ninth that Bernstein made. He made his second recording of the piece with the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] for [[Deutsche Grammophon]], in 1979. This second one featured [[Gwyneth Jones (soprano)|Gwyneth Jones]] (soprano), [[Hanna Schwarz]] (mezzo), [[René Kollo]], and [[Kurt Moll]] (bass), with the chorus of the [[Vienna State Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leonardbernstein.com/disc_other.php?disc_other_php=&amp;disc_other.php=&amp;page=8&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Georg Solti recorded with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra several times. Their last recording of this symphony in 1986 won the Grammy for Best Orchestral Recording.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Seiji Ozawa]] conducted the Nagano Winter Orchestra as well as seven choirs in six countries on five continents, performing the Fourth Movement in its entirety, for the [[1998 Winter Olympic Games]] during the finale of the Opening Ceremony. The chorus locations being New York City, Berlin, Cape Point, Sydney, and Beijing, with two in Nagano: the Tokyo Opera Singers and a 2,000-member chorus in the Nagano Olympic Stadium.

[[Daniel Barenboim]], who had recorded the work twice before, conducted the [[West-Eastern Divan (orchestra)|West-Eastern Divan]] (a youth orchestra of Israel and Arab musicians, which he co-founded) in concert in Berlin on 27 August 2006.

There have been various attempts to record the Ninth to come closer to what Beethoven's contemporaries would have heard, i.e., with period instruments. [[Roger Norrington]] conducting the [[London Classical Players]] recorded it with period instruments for a 1987 release by EMI Records (rereleased in 1997 under the Virgin Classics label). [[Benjamin Zander]] made a 1992 recording of the Ninth with the [[Boston Philharmonic|Boston Philharmonic Orchestra]] and noted soprano Dominique Labelle (who first performed the work with Robert Shaw), following Beethoven's own metronome markings&lt;!-- but with modern instruments I believe --&gt;. 12 years later after Norrington, [[Philippe Herreweghe]] recorded the Ninth with his [[period instruments|period-instrument]] [[Orchestre des Champs-Élysées]] and his [[Collegium Vocale Gent|Collegium Vocale]] chorus for [[Harmonia Mundi]] in 1999. Sir [[John Eliot Gardiner]] recorded his [[period instruments|period-instrument]] version of the Ninth Symphony,&lt;ref&gt;Talli Makell, &quot;Ludwig van Beethoven&quot; in ''Classical Music: The Listener's Companion'' ed. Alexander J. Morin (San Francisco: Backbeat Books, 2002), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; conducting his [[Monteverdi Choir]] and [[Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique]] in 1992. It was first released by [[Deutsche Grammophon]] in 1994 on their early music Archiv Produktion label as part of his complete cycle of the Beethoven symphonies. His soloists included [[Luba Orgonasova]], [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], [[Anthony Rolfe Johnson]] and [[Gilles Cachemaille]]. An additional [[period instruments|period-instrument]] recording by [[Christopher Hogwood]] and the [[Academy of Ancient Music]] was released in 1997 under the label [[Éditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre]].

[[Franz Liszt]] arranged the whole symphony for piano, and that arrangement has been recorded by [[Konstantin Scherbakov]]. [[Richard Wagner]] arranged the orchestral parts for piano, retaining vocal soloists and choir, and this has been recorded by [[Noriko Ogawa]] with the [[Bach Collegium Japan]] directed by [[Masaaki Suzuki]].

At 79 minutes, one of the longest Ninths recorded is [[Karl Böhm]]'s, conducting the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in 1981 with [[Jessye Norman]] and [[Plácido Domingo]] among the soloists. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

One of the first recordings to incorporate many of [[Jonathan Del Mar]]'s corrections was by Sir [[Charles Mackerras]], as the first symphony in his [[EMI]] cycle of the Beethoven symphonies with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Choir in 1991. His soloists included [[Bryn Terfel]], [[Della Jones]], Joan Rodgers and Peter Bronder. Mackerras later re-recorded the Ninth for his second recorded cycle of Beethoven symphonies for [[Hyperion Records]], live at the 2006 [[Edinburgh Festival]], this time with the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]]. [[David Zinman]]'s 1997 recording with the [[Tonhalle Orchester Zürich|Zürich Tonhalle Orchestra]] was a modern instrument recording that used the [[Bärenreiter|Baerenreiter]] edition edited by Jonathan Del Mar.

[[Osmo Vänskä]], conducting the [[Minnesota Orchestra]], recorded the symphony as part of a cycle all of the [[Beethoven]] Symphonies. Released on the [[BIS Records|BIS]] label, it included soloists Helena Juntunen, Katarina Karnéus, Daniel Norman and Neal Davies, as well as the Minnesota Chorale. It received a positive critical reception, including a [[Grammy Award]] nomination in the Best Orchestral Performance category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Anthem==
During the division of Germany in the [[Cold War]], the Ode to Joy segment of the symphony was also played in lieu of an anthem at the [[Olympic Games]] for the [[Unified Team of Germany]] between 1956 and 1968. In 1972, the musical backing (without the words) was adopted as the [[Anthem of Europe]] by the [[Council of Europe]] and subsequently by the [[European Communities]] (now the [[European Union]]) in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/anthem/index_en.htm
 |title=The European Anthem
 |publisher=Europa
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, the [[European Union]] chose Beethoven's music as the EU anthem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/anthem/index_en.htm EUROPA - The EU at a glance - The European Anthem&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Kosovo]] declared independence in 2008, it lacked an anthem, so for the independence ceremonies it used Ode to Joy, in recognition of the European Union's role in its independence. It has since adopted [[Europe (anthem)|its own anthem]]. Additionally, the ''Ode to Joy'' was adopted as the [[national anthem]] of [[Rhodesia]] in 1974 as ''[[Rise O Voices of Rhodesia]]''.

==New Year's tradition in Japan==
The Symphony No. 9, with accompanying chorus, is traditionally performed throughout Japan during its [[Japanese New Year|New Year's celebrations]]. In December 2009, for example, there were 55 performances of the symphony by various major orchestras and choirs in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Brasor, Philip, &quot;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20101224r1.html Japan makes Beethoven's Ninth No. 1 for the holidays]&quot;, ''[[Japan Times]]'', 24 December 2010, p. 20, retrieved on 24 December 2010; Uranaka, Taiga, &quot;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn19991201a5.html Beethoven concert to fete students' wartime sendoff]&quot;, ''[[Japan Times]]'', 1 December 1999, retrieved on 24 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ninth was introduced to Japan by German soldiers held at [[Bandō Prisoner of War camp]] during World War I. Japanese orchestras, notably the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]], began performing the symphony in 1925. During World War II, the [[Empire of Japan|Imperial government]] promoted performances of the symphony, including on New Year's Eve, to encourage allegiance to Japanese nationalism. The symphony was considered appropriate in this regard because Germany was an ally of Japan. After the war, orchestras and choruses, undergoing economic hard times during the reconstruction of Japan, promoted performances of the piece around New Year because of the popularity of the music with the public. In the 1960s, performances of the symphony for the New Year became more widespread and included participation by local choirs and orchestras, establishing the tradition which continues to this day - and which includes, since 2003, a concert of all nine symphonies.&lt;ref&gt;Brasor, Philip, &quot;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20101224r1.html Japan makes Beethoven's Ninth No. 1 for the holidays]&quot;, ''[[Japan Times]]'', 24 December 2010, p. 20, retrieved on 24 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.jp/en/tokyo/feature/242/New-Years-Eve-concerts-in-Tokyo |title=New Year's Eve Concerts in Tokyo |publisher=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |date 15 December 2009 |accesdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s Opus 1 is a set of three [[Piano trio|piano trios]] (written for [[piano]], [[violin]], and [[cello|violoncello]]), first performed in 1793 in the house of [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, Fürst Lichnowsky|Prince Lichnowsky]], to whom they are dedicated. The trios were published in 1795.

Despite the Op. 1 designation these were not Beethoven's first published compositions; this 
distinction belongs to his [[Ludwig van Beethoven#Background and early life|''Dressler Variations'' for keyboard (WoO 63)]].

==Op. 1 No. 1 - Piano Trio No. 1 in [[E-flat major]]==
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] (E flat major) 
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Adagio]] cantabile ([[A flat major]]) 
* [[Scherzo]]. [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] assai (E flat major, with a trio in A flat major) 
* Finale. [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Presto]] (E flat major) 

==Op. 1 No. 2 - Piano Trio No. 2 in [[G major]]==
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Adagio]] - [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] vivace (G major) 
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Largo]] con espressione ([[E major]]) 
* [[Scherzo]]. [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] (G major, with a trio in [[B minor]]) 
* Finale. [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Presto]] (G major) 

==Op. 1 No. 3 - Piano Trio No. 3 in [[C minor]]==
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] con brio (C minor) 
* [[Andante]] cantabile con [[variation (music)|Variazioni]] (E flat major)

* Finale. [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Prestissimo]] (C minor, with a [[tierce de picardie]]) 

This 3rd piano trio was later reworked by Beethoven into the [[String Quintet, Op. 104 (Beethoven)|C minor string quintet, Op. 104]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Opus 70 is a set of two '''[[Piano Trio]]s''' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], written for [[piano]], [[violin]], and [[cello]]. They were published in [[1809]].

The first, in D major, known as the ''Ghost'', is one of his best known works in the genre (rivaled only by the ''[[Piano Trio No. 7 (Beethoven)|Archduke Trio]]'').  The D major trio features themes found in the second movement of ''[[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Symphony No. 2]]''.  The All-Music Guide states that &quot;because of its strangely scored and undeniably eerie-sounding slow movement,  it was dubbed the &quot;Ghost&quot; Trio. The name has stuck with the work ever since. The ghostly music may have had its roots in sketches for a Macbeth opera that Beethoven was contemplating at the time.&quot; 

These pieces are representative of Beethoven's &quot;Middle&quot; stylistic period, which went from roughly [[1803]] to [[1812]], and which included many of his most famous works.  Beethoven wrote the two piano trios while spending the summer of [[1808]] in [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna]], where he had completed his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] the previous summer.  He wrote the two trios immediately after finishing his ''Sinfonia pastorale'', [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6]].  This was a period of uncertainty in Beethoven's life, in particular because he had no dependable source of income at the time. 

After finishing the trios, in the fall of 1808, he began sketching the [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]], the work considered to be the &quot;first draft&quot; of the last movement of the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Opus 70 No. 1 - Piano Trio No. 5 in D major &quot;Ghost&quot;==
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] vivace e con brio
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Largo]] assai ed espressivo
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Presto]]

==Opus 70 No. 2 - Piano Trio No. 6 in E-flat major==
* Poco sostenuto - [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]], ma non troppo
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegretto]]
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegretto]], ma non troppo
* Finale. [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]]

The second movement is in [[double variation]] form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Piano Trio No. 7 in B-flat major''', [[opus number|Op.]] 97, by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] is a [[piano trio]] for [[piano]], [[violin]], and [[cello]], published in 1811.  It is commonly referred to as the ''Archduke Trio'', because it was dedicated to the amateur pianist and composition student of Beethoven, [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1788–1831)|Archduke Rudolph of Austria]].

It was written during the &quot;middle&quot; period of Beethoven's compositional career, which spans approximately 1803 until 1814.  Composition began in the summer of 1810 and it was completed in March 1811.

The first public performance was given by Beethoven himself, [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]] (violinist) and Josef Linke (cellist) at the Viennese hotel ‘Zum römischen Kaiser’ on 11 April 1814, as his deafness continued to encroach upon his ability as a performer.  Of this performance the violinist and composer [[Louis Spohr]] wrote: ''&quot;In forte passages the poor deaf man pounded on the keys until the strings jangled and in piano he played so softly that whole groups of notes were omitted.&quot;'' 

The performance of the piano part in the &quot;Archduke Trio&quot; in 1814 was Beethoven's last performance in the role of pianist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supraphon.cz/cs/novinky/archiv-dle-kategorii/vazna-hudba/&amp;list%5Bsort%5D=&amp;list%5Boffset%5D=5?item=639 Sleevenote of the Supraphon CD (SU 3959-2)]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1814, Beethoven had become completely deaf and could no longer play properly; he did not perform in public again.

==Structure==
The work is in four [[movement (music)|movements]]:

* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] moderato
* [[Scherzo]] ([[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]])
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Andante]] cantabile ma però con moto. Poco piu adagio.
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] moderato - Presto

==References in popular culture==
The ''Archduke'' plays a significant role both in [[Elizabeth George]]'s mystery ''A Traitor to Memory'' (2001); and in [[Haruki Murakami]]'s novel ''[[Kafka on the Shore]]'' (2002).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Violin Sonata No. 5''' in [[F major]], Opus 24, is a [[violin sonata]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. It is often known as the &quot;Spring&quot; sonata (Frühlingssonate), and was published in [[1801 in music|1801]].  Its dedicatee was [[Count Moritz von Fries]], a patron&lt;ref&gt;Fries was also a travelling companion to [[Giovanni Battista Casti]], a playwright and rival of [[Lorenzo da Ponte]], and an influence on [[Mozart]] at a pivotal point in his operatic work, according to [[Alfred Einstein]]'s ''Mozart: His Character, His Work''.&lt;/ref&gt; to whom the [[Violin Sonata No. 4 (Beethoven)|fourth violin sonata]], the [[String Quintet, Op. 29 (Beethoven)|string quintet]] of the same year, and the [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|seventh symphony]] were also dedicated.

The work is in four movements:

#''[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]]''
#''[[Adagio (music)|Adagio]] molto espressivo''
#''[[Scherzo]]: [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] molto''
#''[[Rondo]]: [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] ma non troppo''

The Scherzo and its trio are particularly brief.  The entire sonata takes approximately 22 minutes to perform.

The Allegro movement is featured in stage show [[Fame (musical)|&quot;Fame&quot;]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Barratry''' is the name of three legal concepts, one in [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]], and one in [[admiralty law]].

==Criminal and civil law==

===Australia===
The term barratry has fallen into disuse in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lrc.nsf/pages/DP36CHP2 Discussion Paper 36 (1994) - Barratry, Maintenance and Champerty]. Law Reform Commission, New South Wales. Accessed August 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
In [[England and Wales]] the [[common law offence]] of '''being a common barator''' was abolished by section 13(1)(a) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]].

'''History'''

Being a common barator was an offence under the [[common law]] of England. It was classified as a [[misdemeanour]]. It consisted of &quot;persistently stirring up quarrels in the Courts or out of them&quot;. It is doubtful whether in the ordinary way persons charged with commission of this offence were dealt with by [[indictment]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Law Commission (England and Wales)|The Law Commission]], [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1966/3.html Proposals to Abolish Certain Ancient Criminal Offences] (Law Com 3), paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 the Law Commission recommended that this offence be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Law Commission (England and Wales)|The Law Commission]], [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1966/3.html Proposals to Abolish Certain Ancient Criminal Offences] (Law Com 3), paragraphs 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt; They said that there had been no indictments for this offence for &quot;many years&quot; and that, as an indictable misdemeanour, it was &quot;wholly obsolete&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Law Commission (England and Wales)|The Law Commission]], [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1966/3.html Proposals to Abolish Certain Ancient Criminal Offences] (Law Com 3), paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; Their recommendation was implemented by the Criminal Law Act 1967.

===United States===
Barratry, in criminal and civil law, is the act or practice of bringing repeated legal actions solely to harass.  Usually, the actions brought lack merit.  This action has been declared a [[crime]] in some jurisdictions: for example, in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[California]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], barratry is a [[misdemeanor]];&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Sanford'', 202 Cal. App. Supp. 1 (App. Dept. Sup. Ct 1988); 18 Pa.C.S. 5109.  [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA3/202CA3dS1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Texas]], a [[felony]].&lt;ref&gt;Texas Penal Code section 38.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Barratry also refers to the act of soliciting legal business from potential clients based on a particular event not solely to harass.  For example, an attorney who stops at the scene of a [[car accident]] or follows an [[ambulance]] to an [[emergency room]] in hopes of finding and soliciting business from an injured and aggrieved person might be accused of barratry.  The [[lawyer]] who practices this sort of barratry is called, pejoratively, an ''[[ambulance chaser]]''.

* California Penal Code Section 158: &quot;Common barratry is the practice of exciting groundless judicial proceedings, and is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six months and by fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000).&quot;
* California Penal Code Section 159: &quot;No person can be convicted of common barratry except upon proof that he has excited suits or proceedings at law in at least three instances, and with a corrupt or malicious intent to vex and annoy.&quot;
* Revised Code of Washington 9.12.010: &quot;Every person who brings on his or her own behalf, or instigates, incites, or encourages another to bring, any false suit at law or in equity in any court of this state, with intent thereby to distress or harass a defendant in the suit, or who serves or sends any paper or document purporting to be or resembling a judicial process, that is not in fact a judicial process, is guilty of a misdemeanor; and in case the person offending is an attorney, he or she may, in addition thereto be disbarred from practicing law within this state.&quot;

==Admiralty law==
In [[admiralty law]], barratry is an act of gross misconduct committed by a master or crew of a vessel which damages the vessel or its cargo. These activities may include desertion, illegal [[scuttling]], theft of the ship or [[cargo]], and/or committing any actions which may not be in the shipowner's best interests by the master or crew.

==Other==
Barratry, when used elsewhere, may refer to the buying and selling of positions (which are expected to bring greater income in time) within [[civil authority]]. This venality is the secular counterpart of [[simony]], which is the buying and selling of positions (notably [[benefice]]s) within the [[Christian Church|church]].

In his ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', Canto XXI, [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] places barrators in the Eighth Circle, fifth bolgia of [[Hell]].

A '''bomber''' is a [[military aircraft]] designed to attack ground and sea targets, by dropping [[bomb]]s on them, or&amp;nbsp;– in recent years&amp;nbsp;– by launching [[cruise missile]]s at them.

==Classifications of bombers==
[[File:Kremlin Tupolev Tu-160.jpg|thumb|250px|A 2005 photograph of a [[Tupolev Tu-160]] strategic bomber over [[Olenegorsk, Murmansk Oblast]].]]
[[Strategic bomber]]s are primarily designed for long-range bombing missions against [[strategic target]]s such as supply bases, bridges, factories, shipyards, and cities themselves, in order to damage an enemy's war effort. Current examples include the [[nuclear bomb|nuclear-armed]]: [[B-2 Spirit]], [[B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Tupolev Tu-95]] 'Bear', [[Tupolev Tu-22M]] 'Backfire'; historically notable examples are the: [[Gotha G]], [[Avro Lancaster]], [[Heinkel He-111]], [[Junkers Ju 88]], [[B-17 Flying Fortress]], [[B-24 Liberator]], [[B-29 Superfortress]], and [[Tupolev Tu-16]] 'Badger'.

[[Tactical bombing]], aimed at enemy's military units and installations, is typically assigned to smaller aircraft operating at shorter ranges, typically along the troops on the ground or sea. This role is filled by various aircraft classes, as different as [[light bomber]]s, [[medium bomber]]s, [[dive bomber]]s, [[fighter-bomber]]s, [[ground-attack aircraft]], [[multirole combat aircraft]], among others. Current examples: [[F-15E Strike Eagle]], [[F/A-18 Hornet]], [[Sukhoi Su-34]] 'Fullback', [[Chengdu J-10]], [[Xian JH-7]], Dassault-Breguet [[Mirage 2000]], and the [[Panavia Tornado]]; historical examples: [[Ilyushin Il-2]] ''Shturmovik'', [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'', [[P-47 Thunderbolt]], [[Hawker Typhoon]], and [[F-4 Phantom II]].

==History==
[[File:Caproni CA 2.jpg|thumb|Caproni Ca.2, [[Italy|Italian]] [[heavy bomber]] of the [[World War I]].]]
[[File:Handley Page O-400.jpg|right|thumb|[[Handley Page Type O]] two-engined bomber in flight over oil tanks. The outbreak of World War I led to this design of the first two-engined bomber.]]

Bombers evolved at the same time as the fighter aircraft at the start of [[World War I]]. The first use of an air-dropped bomb however, was carried out by the Italians, initially by [[Giulio Gavotti|Lieutenant Giulio Gavotti]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Libya 1911: How an Italian pilot began the air war era|date=10 May 2011|first=Alan|last=Johnston|publisher=BBC News|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13294524|accessdate=23-05-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in their [[Italo-Turkish War|1911 war for Libya]]. In 1912 Bulgarian Air Force pilot Christo Toprakchiev suggested the use of airplanes to drop &quot;bombs&quot; (as grenades were called in the Bulgarian army at this time) on Turkish positions. Captain Simeon Petrov developed the idea and created several prototypes by adapting different types of grenades and increasing their payload.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulgarian AF History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation.zonebg.com/istoria/balcan-war/index.php|title=Bulgarian Air Force History 1912-1913(in Bulgarian)|accessdate=2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 16, 1912, observer Prodan Tarakchiev dropped two of those bombs on the Turkish railway station of Karaagac (near the besieged Edirne) from an Albatros F.II airplane piloted by Radul Milkov.

After a number of tests Petrov created the final design, with improved aerodynamics, an X-shaped tail and impact detonator. This version was widely used by the Bulgarian Air Force during the siege of Edirne. Later a copy of the plans was sold to Germany and the bomb, codenamed &quot;Chathaldza&quot; (&quot;Чаталджа&quot;, after the strategic Turkish town of [[Çatalca]]) remained in mass production until the end of World War I.

The weight of the bomb was {{convert|6|kg}}; on impact it created a crater {{convert|4|–|5|m}} wide and about {{convert|1|m}} deep.

The Germans used [[Zeppelin]]s as bombers since they had the range and capacity to carry a useful bomb load from Germany to England. With advances in aircraft design and equipment, they were joined by larger multi-engined biplane aircraft on both sides for long range strategic bombing especially by night. The majority of bombing was still done by one-engined biplanes with one or two crew-members flying short distances to attack the enemy lines and immediate hinterland.

The world's first four-engined bomber was the Russian [[Il'ya Muromets]] created in 1914 and successfully used in World War I.

===World War II===
[[File:B-29 in flight.jpg|thumb|A [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] B-29 Superfortress]]
[[File:TBF dropping torpedo NAN2-2-44.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] dropping a torpedo.]]

During World War II bombers often looked dramatically different from other aircraft. This was due largely to the lack of power in aircraft engines, meaning that to carry any reasonable payload, the aircraft had to have multiple engines. The result was a much larger aircraft, one with a reasonable useful load fraction for the role.

With engine power as a major limitation combined with the desire for accuracy and other operational factors, bomber designs tended to be tailored to one particular role. By the start of [[World War II]] this included

* [[dive bomber]]
* [[light bomber]], [[medium bomber]] and [[heavy bomber]]
* [[torpedo bomber]]
* specialized ground attack designs

[[File:Dauntless bomb drop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|United States Navy [[SBD Dauntless]] dive bomber]]

Bombers are not intended to actively engage in combat with other aircraft. The majority have been relatively large and unmaneuverable&amp;nbsp;– although some smaller designs have been used as the basis for specialist fighters, such as [[night fighter]]s.

===Cold War===
[[File:B-58 Hustler.jpg|thumb|left|A B-58A 'Hustler' bomber]]
[[File:F-14 with Bear.jpg|thumb|US Navy F-14 Tomcat escorts Tu-95 Bear D during 1985 NATO exercise Ocean Safari]]
[[File:Avro Vulcan Bomber RAF.JPEG|thumb|right|The [[Avro Vulcan]] was part of the [[RAF]] [[V-Bomber]] force]]

At the start of the Cold War, bombers were the only means to take the nuclear weapons to the enemy and had the role of [[deterrence theory|deterrence]]. With the advent of the guided missile, bombers had to turn to different ways to avoid interception. High speed and high altitude flying became a means of evading detection and attack. Some designs such as the [[English Electric Canberra]] could fly faster or higher than contemporary fighters. Surface to air missiles threatened high flying aircraft, and bombers moved to high speed low flying to get under air defences. Since the bombs were now &quot;stand off&quot; designs (effectively large guided missiles themselves) they did not have to climb over the targets to drop them but would have fired and turned away to escape the blast. [[Nuclear warfare|Nuclear]] strike aircraft were generally finished in bare metal or anti-flash white to avoid any residual effects.

At the same time the need to drop conventional bombs remained in conflicts with a non-nuclear power such as the Vietnam war or [[Malayan Emergency]].

The development of large strategic bombers stagnated in the later part of the Cold War because of spiraling costs and the advent of the intercontinental ballistic missile which was felt to have equal deterrent value while being much more difficult to intercept. The United States Air Force [[XB-70 Valkyrie]] program was cancelled for that reason in the early 1960s, and the later [[B-1 Lancer|B-1B Lancer]] and [[B-2 Spirit]] aircraft entered service only after protracted political and development problems. Their high cost meant that few were built and the 1950s-designed B-52s continued in use into the 21st century. Similarly, the Soviet Union used the intermediate-range [[Tupolev Tu-22M|Tu-22M]] 'Backfire'in the 1970s, but their [[Mach number|Mach 3]] bomber project came to naught. The Mach 2 [[Tu-160|Tu-160 'Blackjack']] was built only in tiny numbers, leaving the earlier Tupolev Tu-16 and [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tu-95]] 'Bear' heavy bombers of 1950s vintage to continue being used into the 21st century. Meanwhile, the [[United Kingdom|British]] strategic bombing force largely came to an end with the phase-out of the [[V Bomber]] force (the last of which left service in 1983). The French [[Mirage IV]] bomber version was retired in the 1996, although the Mirage 2000N (and now the Rafale) have a taken this role since then. The only other nation that fields strategic bombing forces at present is the [[People's Republic of China]], which has a number of [[Xian H-6]]s.

===Modern era===
[[File:JDAM B-1B Lancer.jpg|thumb|Transferring a 2,000 pound [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] to a lift truck for loading onto a [[B-1B Lancer]] [[supersonic]] [[strategic bomber]] in Southwest Asia in 2007.]]

In modern air forces, the distinction between bombers, fighter-bombers, and attack aircraft has become blurred. Many attack aircraft, even ones that ''look'' like fighters, are optimized to drop bombs, with very little ability to engage in aerial combat. Indeed, the design qualities that make an effective low-level attack aircraft make for a distinctly inferior air superiority fighter, and vice versa. Conversely, many fighter aircraft, such as the F-16, are often used as 'bomb trucks,' despite being designed for aerial combat. Perhaps the one meaningful distinction at present is the question of range: a bomber is generally a long-range aircraft capable of striking targets deep within enemy territory, whereas fighter bombers and attack aircraft are limited to 'theater' missions in and around the immediate area of battlefield combat. Even that distinction is muddied by the availability of aerial refueling, which greatly increases the potential radius of combat operations.

Plans in the U.S. and Russia for successors to the current strategic bomber force remain only paper projects, and political and funding pressures suggest that they are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. In the U.S., current plans call for the existing USAF bomber fleet to remain in service until the mid-to-late 2020s, with the first [[2018 Bomber|possible replacements]] becoming operational in 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;usaf new bomber requirements&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/news/defence/air/jdw/jdw071018_1_n.shtml|title=USAF may seek supersonic and unmanned capabilities for bomber|accessdate=2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this bomber the U.S. is also thinking of another [[2037 Bomber|bomber in 2037]]. The 2018 bomber will be made in small quantities as it will be a transition aircraft for this 2037 bomber. The 2018 bomber was, however, required to provide an answer to the fifth generation defense systems (such as [[SA-21 Growler]]s, [[bistatic radar]] and [[Active Electronically Scanned Array]] radar). Also, it was chosen to be able to stand strong against rising superpowers (China, India) and other countries with semi-advanced military capability (Iran). Finally, a third reason was long-term air support for areas with a low threat level (Iraq, Afghanistan). The latter was referred to as close air support for the global [[war on terror]] (CAS for GWOT). The 2018 bomber would thus be able to stay for extended periods on a same location (called persistence).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/06/12/214539/speed-bump-usaf-sets-modest-goals-for-new-bomber.html Persistence in 2018 bomber]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the 2018 bomber and later bombers could be [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|automated]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a wide variety of [[Game of skill|games of skill]] generally played with a [[cue stick]] which is used to strike [[billiard ball]]s, moving them around a [[Baize|cloth]]-covered [[billiards table]] bounded by rubber {{Cuegloss|Cushion|cushions}}.

Historically, the umbrella term was '''billiards'''. While that familiar name is still employed by some as a generic label for all such games, the word's usage has splintered into more exclusive competing meanings in various parts of the world. For example, in [[British English|British]] and [[Australian English]], &quot;billiards&quot; usually refers exclusively to the game of [[English billiards]], while in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]] it is sometimes used to refer to a particular game or class of games, or to all cue games in general, depending upon [[List of dialects of the English language|dialect]] and context.

There are three major subdivisions of games within cue sports:

*[[Carom billiards]], referring to games played on tables without {{Cuegloss|Pocket|pockets}}, including among others [[balkline and straight rail]], [[cushion caroms]], [[carom billiards#Three-cushion billiards|three-cushion billiards]] and [[artistic billiards]]
*[[Pool (cue sports)|Pool]] or pocket billiards, generally played on a table with six pockets, including among others [[eight-ball]] (the world's most widely played cue sport), [[nine-ball]], [[ten-ball]], [[straight pool]], [[one-pocket]] and [[bank pool]].
*[[Snooker]], which while technically a pocket billiards game, is generally classified separately based on its historic divergence from other games, as well as a separate culture and terminology that characterize its play.

More obscurely, there are games that make use of obstacles and targets, and table-top games played with disks instead of balls.

Billiards has a long and rich history stretching from its inception in the 15th century, to the wrapping of the body of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], in her billiard table cover in 1586, through its many mentions in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],&lt;!--Michael Phelan's 1850 book has an entire chapter devoted to mentions in Shakespeare works; which might be useful.--&gt; including the famous line &quot;let's to billiards&quot; in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (1606–07), and through the many famous enthusiasts of the sport: [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Louis XIV of France]], [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Mark Twain]], [[George Washington]], French president [[Jules Grévy]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[George Armstrong Custer]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Lewis Carroll]], [[W. C. Fields|W.C.&amp;nbsp;Fields]], [[Babe Ruth]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Jackie Gleason]], and many others.

==History==

All cue sports are generally regarded to have evolved into indoor games from outdoor stick-and-ball [[lawn game]]s (retroactively termed [[ground billiards]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Victor | last = Stein and Rubino, Paul | year = 1996 | title = The Billiard Encyclopedia: An Illustrated History of the Sport (2nd ed.) | publisher = Blue Book Publications, June 1996 | isbn = 1-886768-06-4  }}, specific page reference needed&lt;/ref&gt; and as such to be related to [[trucco]], [[croquet]] and [[golf]], and more distantly to the stickless [[bocce]] and [[balls]].

The first known mention of a form of the word &quot;billiards&quot; appears in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''Mother Hubberd's Tale'' in 1591, where he speaks of &quot;all thriftles games that may be found ... with dice, with cards, with {{typo|balliards}}.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennet|first=Joseph|title=Billiards|editor=Cavendish|publisher=T. de la Rue|location=London|year=1984|edition=6th|pages=ii|oclc=12788362|url=http://books.google.com/?id=aMkLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=|accessdate=August 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;billiard&quot; may have evolved from the French word ''billart'' or ''billette'', meaning &quot;stick&quot;, in reference to the {{Cuegloss|Mace|mace}}, an implement similar to a [[Golf club (equipment)|golf club]], which was the forerunner to the modern [[Cue stick|cue]]; the term's origin may have also been from French ''bille'', meaning &quot;ball&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everton 1986&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern term &quot;cue sports&quot; can be used to encompass the ancestral mace games, and even the modern cueless variants, such as [[finger billiards]], for historical reasons. &quot;Cue&quot; itself came from ''queue'', the French word for a [[tail]]. This refers to the early practice of using the tail of the mace to strike the ball when it lay against a {{Cuegloss|Cushion|rail cushion}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everton 1986&quot; /&gt;

A recognizable form of billiards was played outdoors in the 1340s, and was reminiscent of croquet. King [[Louis XI of France]] (1461&amp;ndash;1483) had the first known indoor billiard table.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everton 1986&quot; /&gt; [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] further refined and popularized the game, and it swiftly spread amongst the French nobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everton 1986&quot; /&gt; While the game had long been played on the ground, this version appears to have died out in the 17th century, in favor of croquet, golf and bowling games, while table billiards had grown in popularity as an indoor activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everton 1986&quot; /&gt; [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], claimed that her &quot;table de billiard&quot; had been taken away by what would eventually become her executioners (who covered her body with the table's cloth).&lt;ref name=&quot;Everton 1986&quot; /&gt; In 1588, the [[Duke of Norfolk]], owned a &quot;billyard bord coered with a greene cloth... three billyard sticks and 11 balls of yvery&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everton 1986&quot; /&gt; Billiards grew to the extent that by 1727, it was being played in almost every [[Paris]] [[cafe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Everton 1986&quot; /&gt; In England, the game was developing into a very popular activity for members of the gentry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everton 1986&quot; /&gt;

By 1670, the thin butt end of the mace began to be used not only for shots under the cushion (which itself was originally only there as a preventative method to stop balls from rolling off), but players increasingly preferred it for other shots as well. The cue as it is known today was finally developed by about 1800.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everton 1986&quot; /&gt;

Initially, the mace was used to push the balls, rather than strike them. The newly developed striking cue provided a new challenge. Cushions began to be stuffed with substances to allow the balls to rebound, in order to enhance the appeal of the game. After a transitional period where only the better players would use cues, the cue came to be the first choice of equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everton 1986&quot; /&gt;

The demand for tables and other equipment was initially met in Europe by [[John Thurston]] and other furniture makers of the era. The early balls were made from [[wood]] and [[clay]], but the rich preferred to use [[ivory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Everton 1986&quot; /&gt;

Early billiard games involved various pieces of additional equipment, including the &quot;arch&quot; (related to the croquet hoop), &quot;port&quot; (a different hoop) and &quot;king&quot; (a pin or skittle near the arch) in the 1770s, but other game variants, relying on the cushions (and eventually on pockets cut into them), were being formed that would go on to play fundamental roles in the development of modern billiards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Everton 1986&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Studenten Billard.JPG|thumb|200px|Illustration of a three ball [[pocket billiards]] game in early 19th century [[Tübingen]], [[Germany]], using a table much longer than the modern type.]]
The early croquet-like games eventually led to the development of the '''[[carom billiards|carom or carambole billiards]]''' category – what most non-US and non-UK speakers mean by the word &quot;billiards&quot;. These games, which once completely dominated the cue sports world but have declined markedly in many areas over the last few generations, are games played with three or sometimes four balls, on a table without holes (and without obstructions or targets in most cases), in which the goal is generally to strike one {{Cuegloss|Object ball|object ball}} with a {{Cuegloss|Cue ball|cue ball}}, then have the cue ball rebound off of one or more of the cushions and strike a second object ball. Variations include [[three-cushion]], [[Balkline and straight rail|straight rail and the balkline variants]], [[cushion caroms]], [[five-pins]], and [[four-ball]], among others.

Over time, a type of obstacle returned, originally as a hazard and later as a target, in the form of [[Billiards table#Pocket billiards tables|pockets]], or holes partly cut into the table bed and partly into the cushions, leading to the rise of [[pocket billiards]], especially &quot;pool&quot; games, popular around the world in forms such as eight-ball, nine-ball, straight pool and [[one-pocket]] amongst numerous others. The terms &quot;pool&quot; and &quot;pocket billiards&quot; are now virtually interchangeable, especially in the US. [[English billiards]] (what UK speakers almost invariably mean by the word &quot;billiards&quot;) is a hybrid carom/pocket game, and as such is likely fairly close to the ancestral original pocket billiards outgrowth from 18th to early 19th century carom games.

==As a sport==
At least the games with regulated international professional competition have been referred to as &quot;sports&quot; or &quot;sporting&quot; events, not simply &quot;games&quot;, since 1893 at the latest.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTBig&quot;&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40613FF3A5F1A738DDDA90994DA415B8385F0D3 &quot;Meeting of the Champions; The Big Billiard Tournament to Begin To-morrow – What Ives, Schaefer, and Slosson Have Been Doing in Practice – The Older Players Not Afraid of the Big Runs Made by Ives – Something About the Rise and Progress of the Young 'Napoleon' of the Billiard World&quot;], no byline, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1893-12-10, p. 10; [[The New York Times Company]], [[New York, NY]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Quite a variety of particular games (i.e. sets of rules and equipment) are the subject of present-day competition, including many of those already mentioned, with competition being especially broad in nine-ball, snooker, three-cushion and eight-ball.

Snooker, though technically a pocket billiards variant and closely related in its equipment and origin to the game of English billiards, is a professional sport organized at the international level, and its rules bear little resemblance to those of pool games.&lt;!-- There are other places where we need to &quot;respect&quot; snooker as a separate sport; it's really a global tour-de-force and had a WikiProject before &quot;WikiProject Cue sports&quot;, so let's see how we can help them and not step on their toes but also remain historically/logically accurate. -SMcCandlish--&gt;

A &quot;Billiards&quot; category encompassing pool, snooker and carom was featured in the 2005 [[World Games]], held in [[Duisburg]], [[Germany]], and the 2006 [[Asian Games]] also saw the [[Cue sports at the 2006 Asian Games|introduction of a &quot;Cue sports&quot; category]].

===Billiard balls===
{{Main|Billiard balls}}
[[Image:Billiards balls.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Pool balls]]
Billiard balls vary from game to game, in size, design and quantity. Carom billiards balls are larger than pool balls, and come as a set of two cue balls (one colored or marked) and an object ball (or two object balls in the case of the game [[four-ball]]). American-style pool balls, used in any pool game and found throughout the world, come in sets of two {{Cuegloss|Suit|suits}} of object balls, seven {{Cuegloss|Solids|solids}} and seven {{Cuegloss|Stripes|stripes}}, an {{Cuegloss|8 ball|8 ball}} and a {{Cuegloss|Cue ball|cue ball}}; the balls are racked differently for different games (some of which do not use the entire ball set). Blackball (English-style eight-ball) sets are similar, but have unmarked {{Cuegloss|Group|groups}} of {{Cuegloss|Red ball|red}} (or {{Cuegloss|Blue ball|blue}}) and {{Cuegloss|Yellow ball|yellow}} balls instead of solids and stripes, and are smaller than the American-style; they are used principally in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, though not exclusively, since they are unsuited for playing nine-ball. Snooker balls are also smaller than American-style pool balls, and come in sets of 22 (15 reds, 6 &quot;{{Cuegloss|Colour balls|colours}}&quot;, and a cue ball). Other games also have custom ball sets, such as [[Russian pyramid]] and [[bumper pool]].

Billiard balls have been made from many different materials since the start of the game, including clay, [[bakelite]], [[celluloid]], [[crystallite]], [[ivory]], plastic, steel and wood. The dominant material from 1627 until the early 20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was [[celluloid]], invented by [[John Wesley Hyatt]] in 1868, but the material was volatile, sometimes exploding during manufacture and was highly flammable.&lt;ref name=&quot;IEOB&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Shamos | first = Michael Ian | year = 1993 | title = The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Billiards | publisher = Lyons &amp; Burford | location = [[New York, NY]] | pages = Pages: various | isbn = 1-55821-219-1 | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times Company (September 16, 1875).

===Tables===
{{main|Billiard table}}
[[Image:PoolTablewithEquipment-non.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Pool table with equipment.]]
There are many sizes and styles of pool and [[billiards table|billiard table]]s. Generally, tables are [[rectangles]] twice as long as they are wide. Most pool tables are known as 7-, 8-, or 9-footers, referring to the length of the table's long side. Full-size snooker and English billiard tables are {{convert|12|ft|m|1}} long on the longest side. [[Pool hall]]s tend to have {{convert|9|ft|m|1|sing=on}} tables and cater to the serious pool player. [[Public house|Pubs]] will typically use {{convert|7|ft|m|1|sing=on}} tables which are often coin-operated. Formerly, {{convert|10|ft|m|0|sing=on}} tables were common, but such tables are now considered antique collectors items; a few, usually from the late 19th century, can be found in pool halls from time to time. Ten-foot tables remain the standard size for carom billiard games. The slates on modern carom tables are usually heated to stave off moisture and provide a consistent playing surface.

The length of the pool table will typically be a function of space, with many homeowners purchasing an {{convert|8|ft|m|1|sing=on}} table as a compromise. High quality tables are mostly 4.5 by {{convert|9|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}. (interior dimensions), with a bed made of three pieces of thick slate to prevent warping and changes due to humidity. Smaller bar tables are most commonly made with a single piece of slate. Pocket billiards tables normally have six pockets, three on each side (four corner pockets, and two side pockets).

===Cloth===
{{Main|Baize}}
[[Image:Early-1880s-billiards-ladies-JMBB.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Women playing on an elaborately decorated green-covered table in an early 1880s advertising poster.]]
All types of tables are covered with billiard cloth (often called &quot;felt&quot;, but actually a woven wool or wool/nylon blend called [[baize]]). Cloth has been used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century. In fact, the predecessor company of the most famous maker of billiard cloth, [[Iwan Simonis]], was formed in 1453.

Bar or tavern tables, which get a lot of play, use &quot;slower&quot;, more durable cloth. The cloth used in upscale [[pool halls|pool (and snooker) halls]] and home [[billiard room]]s is &quot;faster&quot; (i.e. provides less friction, allowing the balls to roll farther across the table {{Cuegloss|Bed|bed}}), and competition-quality pool cloth is made from 100&amp;nbsp;% [[worsted|worsted wool]]. Snooker cloth traditionally has a nap (consistent fiber directionality) and balls behave differently when rolling against versus along with the nap.

The cloth of the billiard table has traditionally been green, reflecting its origin (originally the grass of ancestral lawn games), and has been so colored since the 16th century, but it is also produced in other colors such as red and blue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shamos 1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Shamos | first = Michael Ian | year = 1991 | title = Pool | publisher = Hotho &amp; Co., June 1991 | isbn = 99938-704-3-9 }}&lt;!--Specific page reference needs to be filled in!--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloth was earlier said to be the most important part of the game, most likely because of the reflection of the game's origin. The players were stubborn in the fact that the cloth should not be ripped. They even made women continue to use maces after cues were invented, for fear that they would rip the cloth with the sharper cues.

===Rack===
{{main|Rack (billiards)}}
[[Image:Billiard Rack.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Aluminum billiard rack that is used for 8-ball, 9-ball, and straight pool.]]

A [[Rack (billiards)|rack]] is the name given to a frame (usually [[wood]], [[plastic]] or [[aluminum]]) used to organize billiard balls at the beginning of a game. This is traditionally triangular in shape, but varies with the type of billiards played. There are two main types of racks; the more common triangular shape which is used for eight-ball and straight pool and the diamond shaped rack used for nine-ball.

===Cues===
:{{main|Cue stick}}
Billiards games are mostly played with a stick known as a cue. A cue is usually either a one piece tapered stick or a two piece stick divided in the middle by a joint of metal or phenolic resin. High quality cues are generally two pieces and are made of a hardwood, generally maple for billiards and ash for snooker.

The {{Cuegloss|Butt|butt}} end of the cue is of larger circumference and is intended to be gripped by a player's hand. The {{Cuegloss|Shaft|shaft}} of the cue is of smaller circumference, usually tapering to an {{convert|0.4|to|0.55|in|mm|abbr=off}} terminus called a {{Cuegloss|Ferrule|ferrule}} (usually made of fiberglass or brass in better cues), where a rounded leather {{Cuegloss|Tip|tip}} is affixed, flush with the ferrule, to make final contact with balls. The tip, in conjunction with chalk, can be used to impart [[Cue sports techniques#Sidespin (english)|spin]] to the cue ball when it is not hit in its center.

Cheap cues are generally made of pine, low-grade maple (and formerly often of [[Gonystylus|ramin]], which is now endangered), or other low-quality wood, with inferior plastic ferrules. A quality cue can be expensive and may be made of exotic woods and other expensive materials which are artfully inlaid in decorative patterns. Many modern cues are also made, like [[Golf club (equipment)|golf club]]s, with high-tech materials such as woven graphite. Skilled players may use more than one cue during a game, including a separate generally lighter cue for the opening break shot (because of cue speed gained from a lighter stick) and another, shorter cue with a special tip for {{Cuegloss|Jump shot|jump shots}}.

===Mechanical bridge===
&lt;span id=&quot;The mechanical bridge&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--Orig. section name; may be linked-to somewhere.--&gt;The mechanical bridge, sometimes called a &quot;rake&quot;, &quot;bridge stick&quot; or simply &quot;bridge&quot;, and &quot;rest&quot; in the UK, is used to extend a player's reach on a shot where the cue ball is too far away for normal hand bridging. It consists of a stick with a grooved metal or plastic head which the cue slides on. Many amateurs refuse to use the mechanical bridge based on the perception that to do so is unmanly. However, many aficionados and most professionals employ the bridge whenever the intended shot so requires. Some players, especially current or former snooker players, use a screw-on cue butt extension instead of or in addition to the mechanical bridge. Bridge head design is varied, and not all designs (especially those with cue shaft-enclosing rings, or wheels on the bottom of the head), are broadly tournament-approved. In Italy a longer, thicker cue is typically available for this kind of tricky shot.
Commonly in snooker they are available in three forms depending on how the player is hampered; the standard rest has a simple cross, the 'spider' has a raised arch around 12&amp;nbsp;cm with three grooves to rest the cue in and for the most awkward of shots, the 'giraffe' (or 'swan' in England) which has a raised arch much like the 'spider' but with a slender arm reaching out around 15&amp;nbsp;cm with the groove.

===Chalk===
[[Image:Billiard Chalk and Cue.jpg|thumb|240px|Billiard chalk is applied to the tip of the cue.]]Chalk is applied to the tip of the cue stick, ideally before every shot, to increase the tip's friction coefficient so that when it impacts the cue ball on a non-center hit, no {{Cuegloss|Miscue|miscue}} (unintentional slippage between the cue tip and the struck ball) occurs. Cue tip chalk is not actually the substance typically referred to as &quot;[[chalk]]&quot; (generally [[calcium carbonate]], also known as [[calcite]] or carbonate of [[Calcium oxide|lime]]), but any of several proprietary compounds, with a [[silicate]] base. &quot;Chalk&quot; may also refer to a cone of fine, white {{Cuegloss|Hand chalk|hand chalk}}; like [[talc]] (talcum powder) it can be used to reduce friction between the cue and bridge hand during shooting, for a smoother stroke. Some brands of hand chalk actually are made of compressed talc. (Tip chalk is not used for this purpose because it is abrasive, hand-staining and difficult to apply.) Many players prefer a slick pool glove over hand chalk or talc because of the messiness of these powders; buildup of particles on the cloth will affect ball behavior and necessitate more-frequent cloth cleaning.  Some players find it useful to moisten the chalk with saliva thereby creating a chalky paste which performs as a lubricant on the cue stick.  This lubrication method is usually attributed to professional pool player Hal &quot;Spitty-Smitty&quot; Smith.

Spinks]] and chemist [[William Hoskins (inventor)|William Hoskins]] in 1897)&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark1&quot;&gt;[http://www.toaster.org/hoskins_tragic.html &quot;The World's Most Tragic Man Is the One Who Never Starts&quot;], Clark, Neil M.; originally published in ''The American'' magazine, May 1927; republished in ''hotwire: The Newsletter of the Toaster Museum Foundation'', vol. 3, no. 3, online edition accessed February 24, 2007.

==Major games (carom and pocket)==
[[Image:Billard p1150796.jpg|thumb|250px|Carom billiards table in a [[Paris]]ian café.]]
{{Main|Carom billiards|Pocket billiards}}
There are two main varieties of billiard games: carom and pocket. The main carom billiards games are straight billiards, balkline and three cushion billiards. All are played on a pocketless table with three balls; two cue balls and one object ball. In all, players shoot a cue ball so that it makes contact with the opponent's cue ball as well as the object ball.

The most popular of the large variety of pocket games are [[eight-ball]], [[nine-ball]], [[One pocket|one-pocket]], [[Billiards#Bank pool|bank pool]], [[snooker]] and, among the old guard, straight pool. In eight-ball and nine-ball the object is to sink object balls until one can legally pocket the winning [[eponym]]ous &quot;{{Cuegloss|Money ball|money ball}}&quot;. Well-known but waning in popularity is straight pool, in which players seek to continue sinking balls, rack after rack if they can, to reach a pre-determined winning score (typically 150). Related to nine-ball, another well-known game is [[Rotation (pool)|rotation]], where the lowest-numbered object ball on the table must be struck first, although any object ball may be pocketed (i.e., combination shot). Each pocketed ball is worth its number, and the player with the highest score at the end of the rack is the winner. Since there are only 120 points available (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;⋯&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;15&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;120), scoring 61 points leaves no opportunity for the opponent to catch up. In both one-pocket and bank pool, the players must sink a set number of balls; respectively, all in a particular {{Cuegloss|Pocket|pocket}}, or all by {{Cuegloss|Bank shot|bank shots}}. In snooker, players score points by alternately potting {{Cuegloss|Red ball|red balls}} and various special &quot;{{Cuegloss|Colour ball|colour balls}}&quot;.

[[Image:Cue and mace.jpg|thumb|Man playing billiards with a cue and a woman with mace, from an illustration appearing in [[Michael Phelan (billiards player)|Michael Phelan]]'s 1859 book, ''The Game of Billiards''.]]

===Straight rail or straight billiards===
{{Main|Balkline and straight rail}}
In straight rail, a player scores a point and may continue shooting each time his cue ball makes contact with both other balls.

Although a difficult and subtle game, some of the best players of straight billiards developed the skill to {{Cuegloss|Gather shot|gather}} the balls in a corner or along the same rail for the purpose of playing a series of {{Cuegloss|Nurse|nurse shots}} to score a seemingly limitless number of points.

The first straight rail professional tournament was held in 1879 where [[Jacob Schaefer, Sr.]] scored 690 points in a single turn&lt;ref name=&quot;Shamos 1991&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--Specific page reference needs to be filled in with {{rp}}!--&gt; (that is, 690 separate strokes without a miss). With the balls repetitively hit and barely moving in endless &quot;nursing&quot;, there was little for the fans to watch&lt;!--, though the matches were popular anyway and the subject of major press coverage **Dig up some good NYTimes 1800s articles and cite them here first.** --&gt;.

===Balkline===
{{Main|Balkline and straight rail}}
In light of these phenomenal skill developments in straight rail, the game of balkline soon developed to make it impossible for a player to keep the balls gathered in one part of the table for long, greatly limiting the effectiveness of nurse shots. A {{Cuegloss|Balkline|balkline}} (not to be confused with {{Cuegloss|Baulk line|baulk line}}, which pertains to the game of [[English billiards]]) is a line parallel to one end of a billiards table. In the ''games'' of balkline – 18.1 and 18.2 (pronounced &quot;eighteen-point-two&quot;) balkline, among other more obscure variations – the players have to drive at least one object ball past a balkline set at {{convert|18|in|mm}} from each rail, after one or two points have been scored, respectively.

===Three-cushion billiards===
{{main|Three-cushion billiards}}
A more elegant solution was three-cushion billiards, which requires a player to make contact with the other two balls on the table ''and'' contact three rail cushions in the process. This is difficult enough that even the best players can only manage to average one to two points per turn.

===English billiards===
{{Main|English billiards}}
Dating to approximately 1800, English billiards is a hybrid of [[Carom billiards|carom]] ''and'' [[pocket billiards]] played on a {{convert|6|ft|m|1|sing=on}} by {{convert|12|ft|m|1|sing=on}} table. Like most carom games, it requires two {{Cuegloss|Cue ball|cue balls}} and a red {{Cuegloss|Object ball|object ball}}. The object of the game is to score either a fixed number of points, or score the most points within a set time frame, determined at the start of the game.

Points are awarded for:
*Two-ball {{Cuegloss|Cannon|cannons}}: striking both the object ball and the other (opponent's) cue ball on the same shot (2 points)
*&lt;!--{{Cuegloss|Winning hazard|--&gt;Winning hazards&lt;!--}}--&gt;: {{Cuegloss|Pot|potting}} the red ball (3 points); potting the other cue ball (2 points)
*{{Cuegloss|Losing hazard|Losing hazards}} (or &quot;in-offs&quot;): potting one's cue ball by cannoning off another ball (3 points if the red ball was hit first; 2 points if the other cue ball was hit first, or if the red and other cue ball were &quot;{{Cuegloss|Split|split}}&quot;, i.e. hit simultaneously).

===Snooker===
{{main|Snooker}}

Snooker is a pocket billiards game originated by [[History of the British Army|British officers]] stationed in [[Colonial India|India]] during the 19th century. The name of the game became generalized to also describe one of its prime strategies: to &quot;{{Cuegloss|Snooker|snooker}}&quot; the opposing player by causing that player to foul or leave an opening to be exploited.

In the United Kingdom, snooker is by far the most popular cue sport at the competitive level. It is played in many other countries as well. Snooker is far rarer in the U.S., where pool games such as eight-ball and nine-ball dominate. The first International Snooker Championship was held in 1927, and it has been held annually since then with few exceptions. The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) was established in 1968 to regulate the professional game, while the International Billiards and Snooker Federation (IBSF) regulates the amateur games.

===Eight-ball===
{{main|Eight-ball}}
[[Image:Eight Ball Rack 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|[[Eight-ball]] rack]]In the United States, the most commonly-played game is eight-ball. The goal of eight-ball, which is played with a full rack of fifteen balls and the cue ball, is to claim a suit (commonly stripes or solids in the US, and reds or yellows in the UK), pocket all of them, then legally pocket the 8 ball, while denying one's opponent opportunities to do the same with their suit, and without sinking the 8 ball early by accident. On the professional scene, eight-ball players on the [[International Pool Tour]] (IPT) were the highest paid players in the world as of 2006 (the IPT nearly folded in 2007, and as of 2008 is attempting a comeback). In the United Kingdom the game is commonly played in pubs, and it is competitively played in leagues on both sides of the Atlantic. The most prestigious tournaments including the World Open are sponsored and sanctioned by the International Pool Tour. Rules vary widely from place to place (and between continents to such an extent that British-style [[Blackball (pool)|eight-ball pool/blackball]] is properly regarded as a separate game in its own right). Pool halls in North America &lt;!--and many other places ??--&gt; are increasingly settling upon the [[World Pool-Billiard Association]] International Standardised Rules. But tavern eight-ball (also known as &quot;{{Cuegloss|Bar pool|bar pool}}&quot;), typically played on smaller, coin-operated tables and in a &quot;winner keeps the table&quot; manner, can differ significantly even between two venues in the same city. The growth of local, regional and national amateur leagues may alleviate this confusion eventually.

===Nine-ball===
{{main|Nine-ball}}
[[Image:Nine-ball rack.jpg|thumb|200px|right|One of many correct nine ball racks: the 1 ball at the {{cuegloss|Apex|apex}} centered over the {{cuegloss|Foot spot|foot spot}}, the 9 ball at center, the other balls placed randomly, and all balls touching.]]
Nine-ball uses only the 1 through 9 balls and cue ball. It is a rotation game: The player at the table must make legal contact with the lowest numbered ball on the table or a foul is called. The game is won by legally pocketing the nine ball. Nine-ball is the predominant professional game, though as of 2006–2008 there have been some suggestions that this may change, in favor of [[ten-ball]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Varner BD 2008-02&quot;&gt;{{BDMag|first=Nick|last=Varner|month=February|year=2008|title=Killing Me Softly?: The Outbreak of the Soft Break Threatens the Game of 9-ball|volume=30|issue=3|pages=pp. 34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2008}}&lt;!--Additional pre-2008 sources needed here.--&gt; There are many local and regional tours and tournaments that are contested with nine-ball. The [[World Pool-Billiard Association]] (WPA), and it American affiliate the [[Billiard Congress of America]] (BCA), publish the World Standardized Rules&lt;!--Do not change British spelling; it is the way WPA spells it--&gt;. The European professional circuit has instituted rules changes, especially to make it more difficult to achieve a legal break shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Varner BD 2008-02&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Panozzo BD 2008-02&quot;&gt;{{BDMag|first=Mike|last=Panozzo|month=February|year=2008|title=Long Live the Cup!|volume=30|issue=3|pages=pp. 34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest nine-ball tournaments are the independent [[US Open Nine-ball Championship]] and the [[WPA World Nine-ball Championship]] for men and women. Male professionals have a rather fragmented schedule of professional nine-ball tournaments. The [[United States Professional Pool Players Association]] (UPA) has been the most dominant association of the 1990s and 2000s. A hotly contested event is the annual [[Mosconi Cup]], which pits invitational European and US teams against each other in one-on-one and {{Cuegloss|Scotch doubles|scotch doubles}} nine-ball matches over a period of several days. The Mosconi Cup games are played under the more stringent European rules, as of 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Panozzo BD 2008-02&quot;/&gt;

===Three-ball===
{{main|Three-ball}}
A variant using only three balls, generally played such that the player at turn continues shooting until all the balls are pocketed, and the player to do so in the fewest shots wins. The game can be played by two or more players. Dispenses with some fouls common to both nine- and eight-ball.

===One-pocket===
{{main|One-pocket}}
One-pocket is a strategic game for two players. Each player is assigned one of the corner pockets on the table. This is the only pocket into which he can legally pocket balls. The first player to pocket the majority of the balls (8) in his pocket wins the game. The game requires far more defensive strategy than offensive strategy, much unlike eight-ball, nine-ball, or straight pool. It has been said{{Weasel-inline|date=June 2008}} that if eight-ball is [[checkers]], one-pocket is [[chess]]. This statement can be verified by watching a game of one pocket. Most times, accomplished players choose to position balls near their pocket instead of trying to actually pocket them. This allows them to control the game by forcing their opponent to be on defense instead of taking a low percentage shot that could result in a loss of game. These low percentage shots are known as &quot;flyers&quot; by one pocket aficionados.

===Bank pool===
{{main|Bank pool}}
Bank pool has been gaining popularity in recent years. Bank pool can be played with a full rack (can be a ''long'' game), but is more typically played with nine balls (frequently called &quot;nine-ball bank&quot;). The balls are racked in nine-ball formation, but in no particular order. The object of the game is simple: to be the first player to bank five balls in any order (eight balls when played with a full rack). Penalties and fouls are similar to one pocket in that the player committing the foul must spot a ball for each foul. This must be done before the incoming player shoots.

==Speed pool==

[[Speed pool]] is a standard billiards game where the balls must be pocketed in as little time as possible. Rules vary greatly from tournament to tournament. The [[International Speed Pool Challenge]] has been held annually since 2006.

'''Bursa''' ({{IPA-tr|ˈbuɾsa}}) is a [[List of cities in Turkey|city]] in northwestern [[Turkey]] and the seat of [[Bursa Province]]. With a population of 2,605,495 (2010),&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkey pop 2009&quot;&gt;[http://tuikapp.tuik.gov.tr/adnksdagitapp/adnks.zul?dil=2 Address-based population survey 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; it is Turkey's [[list of cities in Turkey|fourth largest city]], as well as one of the most industrialized metropolitan centers in the country.

Bursa is settled on the northwestern slopes of [[Uludağ|Mount Uludağ]] in the southern [[Marmara Region]]. It is the capital city of [[Bursa Province]] bordered by the [[Sea of Marmara]] and [[Yalova]] to the north; [[İzmit|Kocaeli]] and [[Sakarya]] to the northeast; [[Bilecik]] to the east; and [[Kütahya]] and [[Balıkesir]] to the south.

The city is frequently cited as &quot;Yeşil Bursa&quot; (meaning &quot;Green Bursa&quot;) in a reference to the parks and gardens located across its urban tissue, as well as to the vast forests in rich variety that extend in its surrounding region. The city is synonymous with Mount Uludağ which towers behind its core and which is also a famous [[ski resort]]. The [[mausoleums]] of early [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman sultans]] are located in Bursa and the numerous edifices built throughout the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period constitute the city's main landmarks. The surrounding fertile plain, its [[thermal bath]]s, several interesting museums, notably a rich museum of [[archaeology]], and a rather orderly urban growth are further principal elements that complete Bursa's overall picture. 

[[Karagöz and Hacivat]] [[shadow play]] characters were historic personalities who lived and are buried in Bursa. Bursa is also home to some of the most famous [[Cuisine of Turkey|Turkish dishes]], especially candied [[chestnut]]s and [[İskender kebap]]. Its [[peach]]es are also well-renowned. Among its depending district centers, [[İznik]], historic [[Nicaea (city)|Nicaea]], is especially notable for its long history and important edifices. Bursa is home to the [[Uludağ University]], and its population attains one of the highest overall levels of education in Turkey. The city has traditionally been a pole of attraction, and was a major center for refugees from various ethnic backgrounds who immigrated to [[Anatolia]] from the [[Balkans]] during the loss of the [[Ottoman territories in Europe]] between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The most recent arrival of Balkan Turks took place in 1989, when the communist regime in Bulgaria expelled approximately 300.000 Bulgarian Turks to Turkey. About one-third of these 300.000 Bulgarian Turkish refugees eventually settled in Bursa.

==History==
[[File:BursaCityMiniature.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Ottoman miniature|miniature style]] painting of Bursa and Mount Uludağ]]

The earliest known site at this location was [[Cius]], which [[Philip V of Macedon]]ia granted to the [[Bithynia]]n king [[Prusias I of Bithynia|Prusias I]] in 202 BC, for his help against [[Pergamum]] and [[Heraclea Pontica]] (modern [[Karadeniz Ereğli]]). Prusias renamed the city after himself, as Prusa.

Prusa evolved into one of the largest cities of [[Mysia]] and retained its importance for the region throughout the [[Hellenistic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] periods. Its strategic location on the westernmost end of the famous [[Silk Road]] ensured Prusa to remain as one of the largest centers of silk trade throughout the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] period. 

Bursa became the first major capital city of the early [[Ottoman Empire]] following its capture from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in 1326. As a result, the city witnessed a considerable amount of urban growth throughout the 14th century. After conquering [[Edirne]] (Adrianople) in 1365 the Ottomans turned it into a joint capital city for governing their European realms, but Bursa remained the most important Anatolian administrative and commercial center even after it lost its status as the sole Ottoman capital. The Ottoman sultan [[Bayezid I]] built the Bayezid Külliyesi (Bayezid I theological complex) in Bursa between 1390 and 1395&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2872|title=Bayezid I Complex|publisher=ArchNet|accessdate=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ulu Cami (Great Mosque) between 1396 and 1400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2881|title=Great Mosque of Bursa|publisher=ArchNet|accessdate=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Bursa was 45,000 in 1487.&lt;ref&gt;The city in the Islamic world, Volume 1, Salma Khadra Jayyusi,Renata Holod,Attilio Petruccioli,André Raymond, page 362&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Ottoman period, Bursa continued to be the source of most royal [[silk]] products. Aside from the local silk production, the city imported raw silk from [[Iran]], and occasionally from [[China]], and was the main production center for the kaftans, pillows, embroidery and other silk products for the Ottoman palaces until the 17th century. 

Another traditional artisanship in the city, among many others, is [[knife]] production, which still continues today. Historically, the city was a center for the production of [[horse carriage]]s during the Ottoman period. In the latter half of the 20th century, Bursa became the largest center of [[motor vehicle]] production in Turkey.

The [[textile industry|textile]] and [[food industry|food]] industries are equally strong, with [[Coca Cola]], [[Pepsi Cola]] and other beverage brands, as well as fresh and [[canned food]] industries being present in the city's organized industrial zones. The top 10 industry corporations in the Bursa province are as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilk250.org.tr/document/2008/2008.xls|title=Bursa'nın İlk 250 Sanayi Kuruluşu|publisher=BTSO|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Bursa was famous for being the largest center of [[silk]] trade in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and later the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires, during the period of the lucrative [[Silk Road]]. The city is still a major center for textiles in Turkey and is home to the Bursa International Textiles and Trade Center (Bursa Uluslararası Tekstil ve Ticaret Merkezi, or BUTTIM.) Bursa was also known for its fertile soil and agricultural activities, which have decreased in the recent decades due to the heavy industrialization of the city.

Bursa is a major center for tourism. One of the most popular [[skiing]] resorts of Turkey is located at [[Uludağ]] just next to the city proper. Bursa's thermal baths have been used for therapeutical purposes since [[Roman Empire|Roman times]]. Apart from the baths that are operated by hotels, [[Uludağ University]] has a [[physical therapy]] center which also makes use of thermal water.

==Education==
[[Uludağ University]] is located in Bursa and is a prominent university in Turkey's [[Marmara Region, Turkey|Marmara Region]]. It was founded in 1975, first as the Bursa University, then re-named as the Uludağ University in 1982. In the 2005–06 academic year, the university had a student body of 47,000. Its Faculty of Medicine is regarded as one of the top medicine faculties in Turkey.

Private Bilgi University has announced plans to open first a two-year and later a four-year university in Bursa within next four years.

===Ulu Cami (The Great Mosque)===

[[File:Ulucamii2-Turkey-2001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Interior of Ulu Cami, showing the fountain (şadırvan) for [[Wudu|ritual ablutions]]]]

[[Bursa Grand Mosque|Ulu Cami]] is the largest mosque in Bursa and a landmark of early [[Ottoman architecture]], which carried many elements from the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate|Seljuk]] architecture. Ordered by Sultan [[Bayezid I]], the mosque was designed and built by architect Ali Neccar in 1396–1400. It is a large and rectangular building, with a total of twenty domes that are arranged in four rows of five, and are supported by 12 columns. Supposedly the twenty domes were built instead of the twenty separate mosques which Sultan [[Bayezid I]] had promised for winning the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396. The mosque has two [[minaret]]s. 

Inside the mosque there are 192 monumental wall inscriptions written by the famous [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphers]] of that period. There is also a fountain ([[şadırvan]]) where worshipers can perform [[Wudu|ritual ablutions]] before prayer; the dome over the şadırvan is capped by a skylight which creates a soft, serene light below; thus playing an important role in the illumination of the large building. 

The horizontally spacious and dimly lit interior is designed to feel peaceful and contemplative. The subdivisions of space formed by multiple domes and pillars create a sense of privacy and even intimacy. This atmosphere contrasts with the later Ottoman mosques (see for example the works of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s chief architect [[Mimar Sinan]].) The mosques that were built after the [[fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, and influenced by the design of the 6th century Byzantine basilica of [[Hagia Sophia]], had increasingly elevated and large central domes, which create a vertical emphasis that is intended to be more overwhelming; in order to convey the divine power of Allah, the majesty of the Ottoman Sultan, and the governmental authority of the Ottoman State.

===Sports===
The city has one professional [[football (soccer)|football]] team competing in the top-flight of [[Turkey|Turkish]] football - [[Bursaspor]], currently playing in the [[Super Lig]]. Bursaspor are the current Super Lig champions, having won the title for the first time in their history in the 2009-10 season. They are also former winners of the [[Turkish Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=bursaspor-leads-the-way-in-football-revolution-2010-05-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Bursa has a borderline [[mediterranean climate|mediterranean]]/[[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: Csa/Cfa). Bursa has hot, humid summers that last from June until September. Winters are cold and damp, also containing the most rainfall, there can be snow on the ground which will last for a week or two. In the mountains; especially Uludağ, it is freezing and snows all winter, summer on the mountains are pleasantly warm.

'''The Bahamas''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|En-us-Bahamas.ogg|ð|ə|_|b|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|m|ə|z}}), officially the '''Commonwealth of The Bahamas''', is a nation consisting of 29 [[island]]s, 661 [[cay]]s, and 2,387 [[islet]]s (rocks). It is located in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] north of [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]] ([[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]]), northwest of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], and southeast of the [[United States]] (nearest to the state of [[Florida]]). Its total land area is {{convert|13939|km2|abbr=on}}, with an estimated population of 330,000. Its capital is [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]. Geographically, The Bahamas lie in the same island chain as Cuba, Hispaniola and the Turks and Caicos Islands; the designation of Bahamas refers normally to the Commonwealth and not the geographic chain.

Originally inhabited by the [[Lucayan]]s, a branch of the [[Arawakan]]-speaking [[Taino]] people, The Bahamas were the site of Columbus' first landfall in the New World in 1492. Although the Spanish never colonized The Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 to 1648, when [[United Kingdom|British]] colonists from [[Bermuda]] settled on the island of [[Eleuthera]].

The Bahamas became a [[Crown Colony]] in 1718 when the British clamped down on [[piracy]]. Following the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], thousands of pro-British loyalists and enslaved Africans moved to The Bahamas and set up a plantation economy. The [[Abolitionism|slave trade was abolished]] in the [[British Empire]] in 1807 and many Africans liberated from slave ships by the [[Royal Navy]] were settled in The Bahamas during the 19th century. Slavery itself was abolished in 1834 and the descendants of enslaved and liberated Africans form the bulk of The Bahamas's population today.

By the terms of GDP per capita, the Bahamas is the fourth richest country in the Americas (following Bermuda, the United States and Canada), the richest one that lies south of the Mexico - US border, as well as the richest one in the world whose population is predominantly of African origin. However these statistics conceal an uneven distribution of wealth and some notable economic and social development challenges faced by the country which is designated by the U.N. as a Small Island Developing State {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Etymology==
The origin of the name ''Bahamas'' is unclear. It may derive from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''baja mar'' (&quot;shallow seas&quot;) or the [[Lucayan]] word for [[Grand Bahama]] island, ''ba-ha-ma'' (&quot;large upper middle land&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;''Languages of the Pre-Columbian Antilles'' by Julian Granberry and Gary Vescelius&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bf-map.png|thumb|left|275px|Map of The Bahamas]]
{{Main|History of The Bahamas}}

[[Taino]] people moved into the uninhabited southern Bahamas from [[Hispaniola]] and [[Cuba]] around the 11th century AD. These people came to be known as the [[Lucayan]]s. There were an estimated 30,000+ Lucayans at the time of Columbus's arrival in 1492. [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first landfall in the [[New World]] was on an island named San Salvador (known to the Lucayans as [[Guanahani]]), which is generally accepted to be present-day [[San Salvador Island]], (also known as Watling's Island) in the southeastern Bahamas.

An alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on [[Samana Cay]], according to calculations made in 1986 by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' writer and editor [[Joseph Judge]] based on Columbus's log. Evidence in support of this remains inconclusive. On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayans and exchanged goods with them.

The Lucayans throughout The Bahamas were wiped out by exposure to [[Infectious disease|diseases]] to which they had no immunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/DUMENE01.ART &quot;Looking for Columbus&quot;]. Joanne E. Dumene. Five Hundred Magazine. April 1990, Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 11–15&lt;/ref&gt; The [[smallpox]] that ravaged the Taino Indians after Columbus's arrival wiped out half of the population in what is now The Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edweek.org/login.html?source=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&amp;destination=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&amp;levelId=2100 Schools Grapple With Columbus's Legacy: Intrepid Explorer or Ruthless Conqueror?]. Education Week. October 9, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally assumed that the islands were uninhabited by Europeans until the mid-17th century. However, recent research suggests that there may have been attempts to settle the islands by groups from Spain, France, and Britain, as well as by other Amerindians. In 1648, the [[Eleutherian Adventurers]] migrated from [[Bermuda]]. These English Puritans established the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named [[Eleuthera]]—the name derives from the Greek word for freedom. They later settled [[New Providence]], naming it Sayle's Island after one of their leaders. To survive, the settlers resorted to [[Wrecking (shipwreck)#The Bahamas|salvaged goods from wrecks]].

In 1670 [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted the islands to the [[Lords Proprietors]] of the Carolinas, who rented the islands from the king with rights of trading, tax, appointing [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|governor]]s, and administering the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anglican&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2009 |url = http://bahamas.anglican.org/history.php|title = Diocesan History|publisher = © Copyright 2009 Anglican Communications Department| accessdate = 2009-05-07 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1684 Spain's corsair Juan de Alcon [[Raid on Charles Town|raided the capital]] Charles Town, and in 1703 a joint Franco-Spanish expedition [[Raid on Nassau|briefly occupied]] the Bahamian capital during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

===18th century===
During proprietary rule, The Bahamas became a haven for [[Piracy|pirate]]s, including the infamous [[Blackbeard]]. To restore orderly government, The Bahamas were made a British [[British overseas territories|crown colony]] in 1718 under the royal governorship of [[Woodes Rogers]], who, after a difficult struggle, succeeded in suppressing piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1720, Rogers led local [[militia]] to drive off a [[Battle of Nassau (1720)|Spanish attack]].

During the [[American War of Independence]], the islands were a target for American naval forces under the command of Commodore [[Esek Hopkins|Ezekial Hopkins]]. The capital of Nassau on the island of New Providence was occupied by [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] for a [[fortnight]].

In 1782, following the British defeat at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]], a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau, and the city [[Capture of The Bahamas (1782)|surrendered without a fight]].

After American independence, some 7,300 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] and their slaves moved to The Bahamas from New York, Florida, and The Carolinas. These Loyalists established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital. The small population became mostly African from this point on.

The British abolished the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] in 1807, which led to the forced settlement on Bahamian islands of thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships by the [[Royal Navy]]. Slavery itself was finally [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolished in the British Empire]] on August 1, 1834.

=== 20th century ===
Modern political development began after the [[Second World War]]. The first political parties were formed in the 1950s and the British made the islands internally self-governing in 1964, with [[Sir Roland Symonette]] of the United Bahamian Party as the first premier.

In 1967, Sir [[Lynden Pindling]] of the Progressive Liberal Party became the first black premier of the colony, and in 1968 the title was changed to prime minister. In 1973, The Bahamas became fully independent, but retained membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Sir Milo Butler was appointed the first Bahamian governor-general (the representative of Queen Elizabeth II) shortly after independence.

Based on the twin pillars of tourism and offshore finance, the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s. However, there remain significant challenges in areas such as education, health care, housing, international narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration from Haiti.

==Geography and climate==
{{Main|Geography of The Bahamas}}
[[File:Bahamas 2009.jpg|thumb|left|The Bahamas from space. [[NASA]] [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellite image, 2009]]

The country lies between latitudes [[20th parallel north|20°]] and [[28th parallel north|28°N]], and longitudes [[72nd meridian west|72°]] and [[80th meridian west|80°W]].

The closest island to the United States is [[Bimini]], which is also known as the gateway to The Bahamas. The island of [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] is to the east of [[Grand Bahama]]. The southeasternmost island is [[Inagua]]. The largest island is [[Andros Island]]. Other inhabited islands include [[Eleuthera]], [[Cat Island, Bahamas|Cat Island]], [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]], [[San Salvador Island]], [[Acklins]], [[Crooked Island (Bahamas)|Crooked Island]], [[Exuma]] and [[Mayaguana]]. [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], capital city of The Bahamas, lies on the island of [[New Providence]].

All the islands are low and flat, with ridges that usually rise no more than {{convert|15|to|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The highest point in the country is Mount Alvernia, formerly called Como Hill, which has an altitude of {{convert|63|m|ft}} on Cat Island.

To the southeast, the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], and three more extensive submarine features called [[Mouchoir Bank]], [[Silver Bank]], and [[Navidad Bank]], are geographically a continuation of The Bahamas, but not part of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

=== Climate ===
{{See also|Geography of the Bahamas}}
The climate of The Bahamas is subtropical to tropical, and is moderated significantly by the waters of the [[Gulf Stream]], particularly in winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Bahamian_dry_forests Location and General Description] Bahamian dry forests, The Encyclopedia of Earth&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, this often proves very dangerous in the summer and autumn, when hurricanes pass near or through the islands. [[Hurricane Andrew]] hit the northern islands during the [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season]], and [[Hurricane Floyd]] hit most of the islands during the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season.

While there has never been a freeze reported in The Bahamas, the temperature can fall as low as {{convert|2|–|3|°C|°F|1}} during Arctic outbreaks that affect nearby Florida. Snow was reported to have mixed with rain in Freeport in January 1977, the same time that it snowed in the Miami area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2002/alm02jan.htm The Weather Doctor]&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature was about {{convert|4.5|°C}} at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esl.lsu.edu/quicklinks/publications/pdfs/thermalhistory.pdf Walker, N.D., Roberts, H.H., Rouse, L.J. and Huh, O.K.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of The Bahamas}}
[[File:BahamianParliamentPanorama.jpg|thumb|[[Parliament of The Bahamas|Bahamian Parliament]], located in downtown [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]]]
[[File:Hubert Ingraham.jpg|thumb|150px|Prime Minister [[Hubert Ingraham]]]]

The Bahamas is a [[sovereign]] [[Independence|independent]] nation. Political and legal traditions closely follow those of the United Kingdom and the [[Westminster system]].
The Bahamas is a parliamentary democracy with two main parties, the Free National Movement and the Progressive Liberal Party.

Tourism generates about half of all jobs, but the number of visitors has dropped significantly since the beginning of the global economic downturn during the last quarter of 2008. Banking and international financial services also have contracted, and The Bahamas is one of 34 secrecy jurisdictions that would be subject to the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act introduced in the U.S. Congress.

The Bahamas is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and a [[Commonwealth realm]] with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as [[head of state]] (represented by a [[List of Governors-General of The Bahamas|Governor-General]]).

[[Legislature|Legislative power]] is vested in a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]], which consists of a 41-member [[Parliament of The Bahamas#House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] (the [[lower house]]), with members elected from [[Plurality voting system|single-member districts]], and a 16-member [[Parliament of The Bahamas#Senate|Senate]], with members appointed by the governor-general, including nine on the advice of the prime minister, four on the advice of the leader of the opposition, and three on the advice of the prime minister after consultation with the leader of the opposition. The House of Assembly carries out all major legislative functions. As under the Westminster system, the prime minister may dissolve parliament and call a general election at any time within a five-year term.

The [[Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]] and is the leader of the party with the most seats in the House of Assembly. [[Executive (government)|Executive power]] is exercised by the cabinet, selected by the prime minister and drawn from his supporters in the House of Assembly. The current governor-general is Sir [[Arthur Foulkes]] and the current [[List of heads of government of the Bahamas|Prime Minister]] is [[Hubert Ingraham]].

The Bahamas has a largely [[two-party system]] dominated by the [[centre-left]] [[Progressive Liberal Party]] and the [[centre-right]] [[Free National Movement]]. A handful of splinter parties have been unable to win election to parliament. These parties have included the [[Bahamas Democratic Movement]], the [[Coalition for Democratic Reform]] and the Bahamian Nationalist Party.

Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. Although The Bahamas is not geographically located in the Caribbean, it is a member of the [[Caribbean Community]]. The [[Judicial independence|judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on [[English law]].

===Administrative divisions===
[[File:Districts of the Bahamas (Labeled).png|thumb|right|300px|Districts of The Bahamas]]
{{Main|Political divisions of the Bahamas}}

The districts of The Bahamas provide a system of local government everywhere except [[New Providence]], whose affairs are handled directly by the central government. In 1996, the Bahamian Parliament passed &quot;The Local Government Act&quot; to facilitate the establishment of Family Island Administrators, Local Government Districts, Local District Councillors, and Local Town Committees for the various island communities. The overall goal of this act is to allow the various elected leaders to govern and oversee the affairs of their respective districts without the interference of Central Government. In total, there are 32 districts, with elections being held every three years. There are also one hundred and ten Councillors and two hundred and eighty-one Town Committee members to correspond with the various districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/bahamasweb2/home.nsf/vContentW/A5FB7665F3E4341306256F0000763055 Family Island District Councillors &amp; Town Committee Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Councillor or Town Committee member is responsible for the proper use of public funds for the maintenance and development of their constituency.

The districts other than New Providence are:

===National symbols===
==== National flag ====
[[File:Flag of the Bahamas.svg|thumb|left|150px|National Flag of The Bahamas]]
The colours embodied in the design of the Bahamian flag symbolise the image and aspirations of the people of The Bahamas; the design reflects aspects of the natural environment (sun, sand, and sea) and the economic and social development. The flag is a black equilateral triangle against the mast, superimposed on a horizontal background made up of two colours on three equal stripes of aquamarine, gold and aquamarine.

The symbolism of the flag is as follows: Black, a strong colour, represents the vigour and force of a united people, the triangle pointing towards the body of the flag represents the enterprise and determination of the Bahamian people to develop and possess the rich resources of sun and sea symbolized by gold and aquamarine respectively. In reference to the representation of the people with the colour black, some white Bahamians have joked that they are represented in the thread which &quot;holds it all together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bahamasschools.com/Symbol%20-%20Flag.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coat of arms of Bahamas.png|thumb|left|150px|Bahamian Coat of Arms]]

====Coat of arms====
{{Main|Coat of arms of The Bahamas}}
The Coat of Arms of The Bahamas contains a shield with the national symbols as its focal point. The shield is supported by a [[marlin]] and a [[flamingo]], which are the national animals of The Bahamas. The flamingo is located on the land, and the marlin on the sea, indicating the geography of the islands.

On top of the shield is a conch shell, which represents the varied marine life of the island chain. The conch shell rests on a helmet. Below this is the actual shield, the main symbol of which is a ship representing the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa María]]'' of Christopher Columbus, shown sailing beneath the sun. Along the bottom, below the shield appears a banner upon which is scripted the national motto:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bahamasschools.com/National%20Coat%20of%20Arms.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;Forward, Upward, Onward Together.&quot;''  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Tecoma stans, flowers+pods.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The yellow elder]]

====National flower====
The [[Tecoma stans|yellow elder]] was chosen as the national flower of The Bahamas because it is native to the Bahama Islands, and it blooms throughout the year.

Selection of the yellow elder over many other flowers was made through the combined popular vote of members of all four of New Providence's garden clubs of the 1970s – the Nassau Garden Club, the Carver Garden Club, the International Garden Club, and the YWCA Garden Club.

They reasoned that other flowers grown there – such as the bougainvillea, hibiscus, and poinciana – had already been chosen as the national flowers of other countries. The yellow elder, on the other hand, was unclaimed by other countries (although it is now also the national flower of the United States Virgin Islands).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bahamasschools.com/Symbol%20-%20Flower.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Prince George Wharf in Nassau Harbor.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Cruise ships in Nassau Harbour]]
{{Main|Economy of The Bahamas}}
One of the most prosperous countries in the Caribbean region, The Bahamas relies on [[tourism]] to generate most of its economic activity. Tourism as an industry not only accounts for over 60 percent of the Bahamian GDP, but provides jobs for more than half the country's workforce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/The-Bahamas-ECONOMY.html &quot;The Bahamas - Economy&quot;.] [http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com ''Encyclopedia of the Nations''.] Retrieved March 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; After tourism, the next most important economic sector is financial services, accounting for some 15 percent of GDP.

The government has adopted incentives to encourage foreign financial business, and further banking and finance reforms are in progress. The government plans to merge the regulatory functions of key financial institutions, including the Central Bank of The Bahamas (CBB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The Central Bank administers restrictions and controls on capital and money market instruments. The Bahamas International Securities Exchange currently consists of 19 listed public companies. Reflecting the relative soundness of the banking system (mostly populated by Canadian banks), the impact of the global financial crisis on the financial sector has been limited.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The economy has a very competitive tax regime. The government derives its revenue from import tariffs, license fees, property and stamp taxes, but there is no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, value-added tax (VAT), or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits. In the most recent year, Overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP is 21.8 percent.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Authorities are trying to increase tax compliance and collection in the wake of the global crisis. Inflation has been moderate, averaging 3.7 percent between 2006 and 2008.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} 

By [[List of countries by GDP per capita|the terms of GDP per capita]], the Bahamas is the fourth richest country in the [[Americas]] (after Bermuda, the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Ethnic groups==
{{Main|Demographics of The Bahamas}}

===Afro-Bahamians===
[[Afro-Bahamian]]s or Bahamians of [[Africa]]n descent are Bahamians whose ancestry lies within the continent of Africa, most notably West Africa. The first Africans to arrive to The Bahamas came from Bermuda with the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] as freed slaves looking for a new life.
Currently, Afro-Bahamians are the largest ethnic group in The Bahamas, accounting for some 85% of the country's population.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Europeans===
[[European Bahamian]]s, or Bahamians of [[Europe]]an descent, numbering about 38,000,&lt;ref&gt;David Levinson (1998). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=uwi-rv3VV6cC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Ethnic groups worldwide: a ready reference handbook]''&quot;. Greenwood Publishing Group. p.317. ISBN 1573560197&lt;/ref&gt; are mainly the descendants of the [[Puritan|British Puritans]] and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|American Loyalists]] who arrived in 1649 and 1783 respectively. They form the largest minority group in The Bahamas making up some 12% of the population.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} 

A small portion of the European Bahamian population is descended from [[Greek Bahamians|Greek]] labourers who came to help develop the sponging industry in the 1900s. Although making up less than 1% of the nation's population, they have been able to preserve their distinct [[Greece|Greek]] culture.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of The Bahamas|Music of The Bahamas}}
[[File:Junkanoo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Junkanoo]] celebration in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]]]

In the less developed outer islands, handicrafts include basketry made from palm fronds. This material, commonly called &quot;straw&quot;, is plaited into hats and bags that are popular tourist items. Another use is for so-called &quot;Voodoo dolls,&quot; even though such dolls are the result of the American imagination and not based on historic fact.&lt;ref&gt;Hurbon, Laennec. &quot;American Fantasy and Haitian Vodou.” ''Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou''. Ed. Donald J. Cosentino. Los Angeles: [[UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History]], 1995. 181–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not practised by native Bahamians, a form of folk magic [[obeah]] derived from West African origins, is practiced in some Family Islands (out-islands) of The Bahamas due to Haitian migration. The practice of obeah is however illegal in The Bahamas and punishable by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.bahamas.gov.bs/statutes/statute_CHAPTER_84.html#Ch84s232]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Junkanoo]] is a traditional African street parade of music, dance, and art held in Nassau (and a few other settlements) every [[Boxing Day]], [[New Year's Day]]. Junkanoo is also used to celebrate other holidays and events such as Emancipation Day.

[[Regatta]]s are important social events in many family island settlements. They usually feature one or more days of sailing by old-fashioned [[work boats]], as well as an onshore festival.

Some settlements have festivals associated with the traditional crop or food of that area, such as the &quot;Pineapple Fest&quot; in Gregory Town, [[Eleuthera]] or the &quot;Crab Fest&quot; on Andros. Other significant traditions include [[story telling]].

'''Baker Island''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|eɪ|k|ər}}) is an uninhabited [[atoll]] located just north of the [[equator]] in the central [[Pacific Ocean]] about {{convert|3100|km|nmi mi}} southwest of [[Honolulu]]. The island lies almost halfway between [[Hawaii]] and [[Australia]], and is a possession of the [[United States]]. Its nearest neighbor is [[Howland Island]], {{convert|68|km|nmi mi}} to the north.

Located at {{coord|0|11|41|N|176|28|46|W|display=inline|type:isle_scale:10000_region:UM-81_source:gnis-1392997}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gnis|id=1392997|name=Baker Island|accessdate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the island covers {{convert|1.64|km2|sqmi}}, with {{convert|4.9|km|mi|2}} of coastline. The climate is equatorial, with little rainfall, constant wind, and strong sunshine. The terrain is low-lying and sandy: a coral island surrounded by a narrow fringing reef with a depressed central area devoid of any lagoon with its highest point being {{convert|8|m|ft}} above sea level.

The island now forms the '''Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge''', which consists of all {{convert|405|acre|ha}} of the island and a surrounding &lt;!-- {{convert|30500|acre|sqmi|3}} --&gt; {{convert|30500|acre|ha|0}} or {{convert|47.656|sqmi|km2|2|abbr=on}} of submerged land. The [[National Wildlife Refuge]] is managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] as an [[insular area]] under the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of the Interior]] and is an [[Territories of the United States|unincorporated]] and [[unorganized territory]] of the U.S.

Its defense is the responsibility of the United States; though uninhabited, it is visited annually by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]. For statistical purposes, Baker is grouped with the [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]].

==Description==
A cemetery and rubble from earlier settlements are located near the middle of the west coast, where the boat landing area is located. There are no ports or harbors, with anchorage available only offshore. The narrow fringing reef surrounding the island can be a maritime hazard, so there is a [[day beacon]] near the old village site. Baker's abandoned [[World War II]] runway, {{convert|1665|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, is completely covered with vegetation and is unservicable. 
 
The United States claims an [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on|lk=in}} and [[territorial waters|territorial sea]] of {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}} around Baker Island.

During a 1935–1942 colonization attempt, the island was most likely on Hawaii time, which was then 10.5 hours behind [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elgen M.

Howland Island was using the 10+30 hour time zone—the same as Hawaii standard time.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is uninhabited the island's time zone is unspecified, but it lies within a [[Nautical time|nautical time zone]] 12 hours behind UTC.

==History==
[[Image:Orthographic projection over Baker Island.png|thumb|left|Orthographic projection over Baker Island.]]
Baker was discovered in 1818 by Captain Elisha Folger of the [[Nantucket]] whaling ship ''Equator'', who called the island &quot;New Nantucket&quot;. In August 1825 Baker was resighted by Captain [[Starbuck (whaling family)#Obed Starbuck|Obed Starbuck]] of the ''Loper'', also a Nantucket whaler. The name goes back to Michael Baker, who visited the island in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Evans Maude|title=Of islands and men: studies in Pacific history|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other references state that he visited in 1832, and again on August 14, 1839, in the [[whaler]] ''Gideon Howland'', to bury an American seaman.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, 1941&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States took possession of the island in 1857, claiming it under the [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edwin Horace Bryan|title=American Polynesia: coral islands of the Central Pacific|publisher=Tongg Publishing Company|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|year=1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[guano]] deposits were mined by the American Guano Company from 1859 to 1878. [[John T. Arundel]] and Company, a British firm, made the island its headquarters for its guano-digging operations in the Pacific from 1886 to 1891. 

In 1866 the [[British Empire]] made a claim on the island, also using it for guano. It was eventually recaptured by the USA in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/baker.htm&lt;/ref&gt; To clarify American sovereignty, Executive Order 7358 was issued on May 13, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.att.net/~higley.family/HullMemo.htm] Memorandum of Secretary of State Cordell Hull to the president, February 18, 1936
Presidential Private File, Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Hyde Park, N.Y. Retrieved: March 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, a short-lived attempt at colonization was begun. The American colonists arrived aboard the USCGC [[USCGC Itasca (1929)|''Itasca'']], the same vessel that brought colonists to neighboring [[Howland Island]], on April 3, 1935. They built a lighthouse, substantial dwellings, and attempted to grow various plants. One sad-looking clump of coconut palms was jokingly called &quot;King-Doyle Park&quot; after two well-known citizens of Hawaii who visited on the ''Taney'' in 1938. This clump was the best on the island, planted near a water seep, but the dry climate and sea birds, eager for anything upon which to perch, did not give the trees or shrubs much of a chance to survive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anytravels.com/oceania/baker&lt;/ref&gt;

King-Doyle Park was later adopted as a geographical name by the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]].

The settlement was named '''[[Meyerton, Baker Island|Meyerton]]''' after Captain H.A. Meyer of the [[United States Army]], who helped establish the camps for the colonists in 1935. It had a population of four American civilians, who were all evacuated in 1942 after [[Japan]]ese air and naval attacks. During [[World War II]] it was occupied by the U.S. military. 

Since the war, Baker Island has been uninhabited. [[Feral]] cats were eradicated from the island in 1964. Public entry is by special-use permit only from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and it is generally restricted to scientists and educators.

==LORAN Station Baker==
[[LORAN]] station Baker was a radio operations base in operation from September 1944 to July 1946. The station unit number was 91 and the radio call sign was NRN-1.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.loran-history.info/Baker/baker.htm LORAN STATION BAKER ISLAND 0 11 46.23 N 176 28 26.14 W&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
[[Image:Nwrbakerisle a320.gif|thumb|right|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service aerial view of Baker Island]]
Baker has no natural fresh water sources. It is treeless, with sparse vegetation consisting of four kinds of grass,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of Interior. [http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/bhpage.htm Baker Island.]  Retrieved 6 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; prostrate vines and low-growing shrubs. The island is primarily a nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat for seabirds, shorebirds, and marine wildlife.

Baker Island is home to a number of threatened and endangered species. The [[ruddy turnstone]], [[bar-tailed godwit]], [[sanderling]], [[bristle-thighed curlew]] and [[Pacific golden plover]] are shorebirds that inhabit the island and are considered species of High Concern on the national conservation priority scheme. [[Green turtles]] and [[hawksbill turtle]]s, both threatened, can be found along the reef.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fws.gov/bakerisland/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Seabird species such as the [[Lesser Frigatebird|lesser frigatebird]], [[Brown Noddy|brown noddy]] and [[sooty tern]] use the island for nesting and roosting. The island is also believed to be a rest stop for arctic-breeding shorebirds.

==Environmental Contaminants==
Debris from past human occupation is scattered throughout the island and in offshore waters. Most is from the U.S. military occupation of the island from 1942 to 1946. The most noticeable remnant is the 150-foot wide, 5,400-foot long airstrip. It is completely overgrown with vegetation and is unusable. In the northeast section, apparently the main camp area, are the remains of several buildings and heavy equipment. Five wooden antenna poles about 40 feet in height remain standing in the camp. Several crashed airplanes and large equipment such as bulldozers are scattered around the island. Numerous bulldozer excavations containing the remnants of metal, fuel, and water drums are scattered about the north central portion and northern edge of the island. The Navy reported the loss of 11 landing craft in the surf during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/pacific/planning/main/docs/HI-PI/HBJ/Baker%20Draft%20CCP.pdf|work=Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex|title=Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge: Draft Comprehensive Conservation Plan and Environmental Assessment|date=August 2007|accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bangladesh''' ({{IPAc-en|Bangladesh.ogg|ˈ|b|ɑː|ŋ|ɡ|l|ə|d|ɛ|ʃ}} or {{IPAc-en|En-us-Bangladesh.ogg|b|æ|ŋ|ɡ|l|ə|ˈ|d|ɛ|ʃ}}; {{lang-bn|&lt;!--The following spelling is correct. If you see anything odd, your browser isn't Unicode compliant:--&gt; বাংলাদেশ}}), officially the '''People's Republic of Bangladesh''' ([[Bengali language|Bangla]]: গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ ''{{lang|inc-Latn|Gônoprojatontri Bangladesh}}'') is a [[sovereign state]] located in [[South Asia]]. It is [[India–Bangladesh border|bordered]] by [[India]] on all sides except for a small border with [[Burma]] (Myanmar) to the far southeast and by the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the south. Together with the Indian state of [[West Bengal]], it makes up the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]]. The name ''Bangladesh'' means &quot;Country of Bengal&quot; in the official [[Bengali language]].

The borders of present-day Bangladesh were established with the [[1947 Partition of Bengal|partition of Bengal]] and [[Partition of India|India]] in 1947, when the region became [[East Pakistan]], part of the newly formed nation of [[Pakistan]]. However, it was separated from the [[West Pakistan|western wing]] by {{convert|1600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of Indian territory. Due to political exclusion, ethnic and linguistic discrimination, and economic neglect by the politically-dominant West Pakistan, popular agitation grew against [[West Pakistan]] and led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971, which the Bengali people won with the support of India. After independence, the new state endured famines, natural disasters and widespread poverty, as well as political turmoil and [[Military coups in Bangladesh|military coups]]. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by relative calm and economic progress. 

Bangladesh is a [[Constitution of Bangladesh|secular republic]] and a [[parliamentary democracy]], with an elected parliament called the [[Jatiyo Sangshad]]. It is the [[List of countries by population|eighth most populous country]] and among the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|most densely populated countries]] in the world. A high poverty rate prevails, although the United Nations has acclaimed Bangladesh for achieving tremendous progress in [[Human Development Index|human development]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org.bd/info/events.php?newsid=734&amp;t=In%20News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11694599&lt;/ref&gt;Geographically, the country straddles the fertile [[Ganges Delta|Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta]] and is subject to annual [[monsoon]] floods and [[cyclone]]s. 

The country is listed among the [[Next Eleven|Next Eleven economies]] and [[3G (countries)|Global Growth Generator countries]]. It is a founding member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]], the [[Developing 8 Countries|D-8]] and [[BIMSTEC]], and a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. However, Bangladesh continues to face a number of major challenges, including widespread political and bureaucratic corruption, economic competition relative to the world, serious [[overpopulation]], widespread poverty, and an increasing danger of hydrologic shocks brought on by ecological vulnerability to [[climate change]].

The kingdom of [[Gangaridai]] was formed from at least the 7th century&amp;nbsp;BC, which later united with [[Bihar]] under the [[Magadha Empire|Magadha]], [[Nanda Empire|Nanda]], [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] and [[Sunga Empire|Sunga]] Empires. Bengal was later part of the [[Gupta Empire]] and [[Harsha|Harsha Empire]] from the 3rd to the 6th centuries&amp;nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]]. Following its collapse, a dynamic Bengali named [[Shashanka]] founded an impressive short-lived kingdom. After a period of [[anarchy]], the bengali [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]] ruled the region for four hundred years, followed by a shorter reign of the [[Hindu]] [[Sena dynasty]].
Medieval European geographers located paradise at the mouth of the Ganges and although this was overhopeful, Bengal was probably the wealthiest part of the subcontinent up until the 16th century. The area's early history featured a succession of Indian empires, internal squabbling, and a tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance.

Islam was introduced to Bengal in the 12th century by Arab Muslim merchants; [[Sufism|Sufi]] missionaries and subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread [[Islam]] throughout the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;eaton&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Eaton |first=R |year=1996 |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-20507-3 |oclc=26634922 76881262}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiar Khilji]], a Turkic general, defeated [[Lakshman Sen]] of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of Bengal in the year 1204. The region was ruled by several [[Sultanate of Bengal|sultans]] and land lords [[Bhuiyan]] for the next few hundred years. By the 16th century, the [[Mughal Empire]] controlled Bengal, and Dhaka became an important provincial centre of Mughal administration.

It agitated for [[Six point movement|autonomy]] in the 1960s, and in 1966, its president, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] (Mujib), was jailed; he was released in 1969 after an unprecedented popular uprising. In 1970, a massive [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]] devastated the coast of East Pakistan, killing up to half a million people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1483615/Bangladesh-cyclone-of-1991 Bangladesh cyclone of 1991]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the central government responded poorly. The Bengali population's anger was compounded when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose [[Awami League]] won a majority in Parliament in the 1970 elections,&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt; was blocked from taking office.

After staging compromise talks with Mujib, President [[Yahya Khan]] arrested him in the early hours of 26 March 1971, and launched [[Operation Searchlight]],&lt;ref name=&quot;salik&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Salik |first=Siddiq |year=1978 |title=Witness to Surrender |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-577264-4 |unused_data=ISBN status=May be invalid – please double check}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sustained military assault on East Pakistan.

Before his arrest by the [[Pakistan Army]], Sk. Mujibur Rahman formally declared the independence of Bangladesh, and directed everyone to fight till the last soldier of the Pakistan army was evicted from East Pakistan. Awami League leaders set up a government-in-exile in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], India. The exile government formally took oath at Mujib Nagar in Kustia district of East Pakistan on 17 April 1971, with Tajuddin Ahmad as the first Prime Minister.

After Mujib declared independence of Bangladesh, Yahyah’s brutal crackdown, including a virtual massacre of the intelligentsia in the universities of Bangladesh, was comparable in method to the war crimes of the Nazis. International public opinion was revolted and a tidal wave of hapless refugees, their number soon reaching 10 million, sought shelter in India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianexpress.com/news/birth-of-a-nation/552795/2&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] lasted for nine months. The [[Bangladesh Forces]] formed within 11 [[list of Sectors in Bangladesh Liberation War|sectors]] led by General M.A.G. Osmani consisting of Bengali Regulars, and [[Mukti Bahini]] conducted a massive guerilla war against the Pakistan Forces with all out support from the [[Indian Armed Forces]]. Jointly, the [[Mitro Bahini]] achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan on 16 December 1971, with Indian Armed Forces taking over 90,000 [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].

&lt;!--[[File:JSS.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jatiyo Smriti Soudho]], a tribute to the martyrs of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]]]--&gt;
After its independence, Bangladesh became a parliamentary democracy, with Mujib as the Prime Minister. In the 1973 parliamentary elections, the Awami League gained an absolute majority. A nationwide famine occurred during 1973 and 1974,&lt;ref name=&quot;sen&quot;/&gt; and in early 1975, Mujib initiated a one-party socialist rule with his newly formed [[BAKSAL]]. On 15 August 1975, Mujib and most of his family members were assassinated by mid-level military officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;mascarenhas&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Mascarenhas |first=A |year=1986 |title=Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton, London |isbn=0-340-39420-X |oclc=13004864 16583315 242251870}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of bloody coups and counter-coups in the following three months culminated in the ascent to power of General [[Ziaur Rahman]], who reinstated multi-party politics, and founded the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP). Zia's rule ended when he was assassinated by elements of the military in 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;mascarenhas&quot;/&gt;

Bangladesh's next major ruler was General [[Hossain Mohammad Ershad]], who gained power in a bloodless coup in 1982, and ruled until 1990, when he was forced to resign after a massive revolt of all major political parties and the public, along with pressure from western donors (which was a major shift in international policy after the fall of the Soviet Union). Since then, Bangladesh has reverted to a parliamentary democracy. Zia's widow, [[Khaleda Zia]], led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to parliamentary victory at the general election in 1991, and became the first female Prime Minister in Bangladeshi history. However, the Awami League, headed by [[Sheikh Hasina]], one of Mujib's surviving daughters, won the next election in 1996. It lost again to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in 2001.

On 11 January 2007, following widespread political unrest, a caretaker government was appointed to administer the next general election. The country had suffered from extensive corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4353334.stm |title=Bangladesh tops most corrupt list |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-10-18 |accessdate=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; disorder and political violence. The new caretaker government has made it a priority to root out corruption from all levels of government. To this end, many notable politicians and officials, along with large numbers of lesser officials and party members, have been arrested on corruption charges. The caretaker government held what observers described as a largely free and fair election on 29 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/world/asia/30iht-bangla.5.19007747.html|title=Bangladesh election seen as fair, though loser disputes result|work=New York Times|date=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awami League's [[Sheikh Hasina]] won the elections with a landslide victory and took the oath of Prime Minister on 6 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE5053GG20090106 |title= Hasina takes oath as new Bangladesh prime minister|work=Reuters |date= 2009-01-06|accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh is a [[unitary state]] and [[parliamentary democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.bd/Constitution_English/index.htm |title=Constitution of Bangladesh |publisher=Parliament.gov.bd |date= |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct elections in which all [[citizens]], aged 18 or over, can vote are held every five years for the [[unicameral]] [[parliament]] known as [[Jatiya Sangsad]]. The parliamentary building is known as the ''[[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]]'' and was designed by architect [[Louis Kahn]]. Currently the parliament has 345 members including 45 reserved seats for women, elected from single-member constituencies. The [[Prime Minister]], as the [[head of government]], forms the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and runs the day-to-day affairs of state. While the Prime Minister is formally appointed by the [[President of Bangladesh|President]], he or she must be an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] who commands the confidence of the majority of parliament. The President is the [[Head of State|head of state]] but mainly a ceremonial post elected by the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3452.htm Background Note: Bangladesh], US Department of State, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

However the President's powers are substantially expanded during the tenure of a [[caretaker government]], which is responsible for the conduct of elections and transfer of power. The officers of the caretaker government must be non-partisan and are given three months to complete their task. This transitional arrangement is an innovation that was pioneered by Bangladesh in its 1991 election and then institutionalized in 1996 through its 13th constitutional amendment.&lt;ref name=&quot;amendments&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1525/as.1997.37.6.01p0256x|last=Khan|first=Zillur R.|title=Bangladesh's experiments with parliamentary democracy|journal=Asian Survey|year=1997|volume=37|issue=6|pages=575–589|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2645531|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] was drafted in 1972 and has undergone 14 [[Constitutional amendment|amendments]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amendments&quot;/&gt; The highest [[judicial]] body is the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|Supreme Court]]. Justices are appointed by the President. The judicial and law enforcement institutions are weak.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICG&quot;&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/south-asia/bangladesh/121-bangladesh-today.aspx Bangladesh Today], Asia Report N°121, [[International Crisis Group]], October 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Separation of powers, judicial from executive was finally implemented on the 1st of November, 2007. It is expected that this separation will make the judiciary stronger and impartial. Laws are loosely based on [[English law|English common law]], but family laws such as marriage and inheritance are based on religious scripts, and therefore differ between religious communities.

[[List of political parties in Bangladesh|Major parties]] in Bangladesh are the [[Bangladesh Awami League]] and the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP). BNP is led by [[Khaleda Zia]] and has traditionally been allied with [[Islamist]] parties like [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]] and [[Islami Oikya Jot]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gZfzaIgc4BxQNDfs8-VBX--KgzPA ]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Sheikh Hasina]]'s Awami League aligns with [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] and [[Secularism|secularist]] parties. Hasina and Zia are bitter rivals who have dominated politics for over 15 years; each is related to one of the leaders of the independence movement. Another important player is the [[Jatiya Party]], headed by former military dictator Ershad. The Awami League-BNP rivalry has been bitter and punctuated by protests, violence and murder. Student politics is particularly strong in Bangladesh, a legacy from the liberation movement era. Almost all parties have highly active student wings, and student leaders have been elected to the Parliament.

Two radical terrorist organizations, [[Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh]] (JMJB) and [[Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh]] (JMB), were banned in February 2005. Several small-scale bomb attacks taking place since 1999 have been blamed on those groups, and dozens of suspected members have been detained in security operations, including the heads of those two parties in 2006. The masterminds were tried and executed. The Bangladesh government won praise from world leaders, including Western leaders, for its strong anti-terrorist stance.

The January 22, 2007 election was postponed indefinitely and emergency law declared on January 11, 2007 as the Army backed caretaker government of [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]] aimed to prepare a new voter list and crack down on corruption. They also assisted the interim Government of Bangladesh in a drive against corruption, which resulted in Bangladesh's position in [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] changed from the very bottom, where they had been for 3 years in a row, to 147th in just 1 year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table |title=cpi 2008 table /cpi2008/2008/in focus/news room |publisher=Transparency.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large alliance led by the Bangladesh Awami League won the December 29, 2008 poll, in a landslide victory. They got 230 seats among 300 seats in the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://123.49.39.5/result/report4.php?lang=en |title=Bangladesh Election Commission |publisher=123.49.39.5 |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BNS Bongobondhu2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[BNS Bangabandhu]], a [[Bangladeshi Navy]] frigate.]]
Bangladesh pursues a moderate foreign policy that places heavy reliance on multinational diplomacy, especially at the United Nations. In 1974 Bangladesh joined both the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]] and has since been elected to serve two terms on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] in 1978–1979 and 2000–2001. In the 1980s, Bangladesh played a lead role in founding the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) in order to expand relations with other South Asian states. Since the founding of SAARC 1985, a Bangladeshi has held the post of Secretary General on two occasions.

Bangladesh's most important and complex foreign relationship is with [[India]]. This relationship is informed by historical and cultural ties and forms an important part of the domestic political discourse. Bangladesh's [[India-Bangladesh relations|relationship with India]] began on a positive note because of India's assistance in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|independence war]] and reconstruction. Throughout the years, relations between both countries have fluctuated for a number of reasons.

A major source of tension between Bangladesh and India is the [[Farakka Barrage|Farakka Dam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MMAli&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=M.M.|last=Ali |title= India’s Major Gains and Losses in World Affairs |url= http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0397/9703025.htm |publisher=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|id= |date= March 1997|accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, India constructed a dam on the [[Ganges River]] {{convert|11|mi|km}} from the Bangladeshi border. Bangladesh alleges that the dam diverts much needed water from Bangladesh and adds a man-made disaster to the country already plagued by natural disasters. The dam also has terrible ecological consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMAli&quot; /&gt; On the other hand, India has voiced concerns about anti-Indian separatists and Islamic militants allegedly being harboured across their {{convert|2500|mi|km|sing=on}} border, as well as the flow of illegal migrants, and is [[Indo-Bangladeshi barrier|building a fence along most of it]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/26/asia/AS-FEA-GEN-Bangladesh-Fenced-In.php India quietly ringing Bangladesh with barbed-wire, cutting off former neighbors], by Tim Sullivan, Associated Press, June 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; But at the 2007 SAARC meeting both nations pledged to work cooperatively on security, economic and border issues.&lt;ref&gt;Pattanaik, Smruti S., &quot;[http://www.idsa.in/idsastrategiccomments/IndiaBangladeshRelationsaftertheForeignSecretaryLevelTalks_SSPattanaik_170707 India-Bangladesh Relations after the Foreign Secretary Level Talks],&quot; Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses, July 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current strength of the army is around 200,000 including reservists,&lt;ref name=&quot;bdmil&quot;&gt;[http://www.bdmilitary.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=124 Bangladesh Military Forces].

Retrieved July 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to traditional defense roles, the military has been called on to provide support to civil authorities for disaster relief and internal security during periods of political unrest. Bangladesh is not currently active in any ongoing war, but it did contribute 2,300 troops to the coalition that fought in [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991 and Bangladesh is consistently a top contributor to UN peacekeeping forces around the world. As of May 2007, Bangladesh had major deployments in [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], [[Timor-Leste]] and [[Cote d'Ivoire|Côte d'Ivoire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://army.mil.bd/newahq/index5.php?category=177 |title= TOTAL BD PARTICIPATION IN UN DEPL (COMPLETED) |accessdate=2008-05-02 |month=February | year=2007 |publisher= [[Bangladesh Army]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080611133501/http://army.mil.bd/newahq/index5.php?category=177 |archivedate = June 11, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently Bangladesh is the largest troop contributor country to the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bangladeshi officers enhance UN troops’ logistical support in Darfur | work = UN News Center | publisher = United Nations | date = 2008-10-23 | url = http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28691&amp;Cr=darfur&amp;Cr1= | accessdate = 2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh enjoys relatively warm ties with the People's Republic of China which has, particularly in the past decade, increased economic cooperation with the South Asian nation. Between 2006 and 2007, trade between the two nations rose by 28.5% and there have been agreements to grant various Bangladeshi commodities tariff-free access to the Chinese market.
Cooperation between the [[Military of Bangladesh]] and the [[People's Liberation Army]] is also increasing, with joint military agreements signed and Bangladesh procuring Chinese arms which range from small arms to large naval surface combatants such as the Chinese [[Jianghu class frigate|Type 053H1]] Missile Frigate.

== Divisions, districts and upazilas ==
{{Main|Divisions of Bangladesh|Districts of Bangladesh|Upazilas of Bangladesh}}
[[File:Bangladesh divisions english.svg|thumb|Administrative divisions of Bangladesh. This map shows the highest level unit called a Division.]]
Bangladesh is divided into seven administrative divisions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?cid=2&amp;id=151976&amp;hb=top]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA2007&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bg.html CIA World Factbook 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; each named after their respective divisional headquarters: [[Barisal Division|Barisal]] (বরিশাল), [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]] (চট্টগ্রাম), [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]] (ঢাকা), [[Khulna Division|Khulna]] (খুলনা), [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]] (রাজশাহী), [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] (সিলেট)&lt;!--The spelling is correct. If you see anything odd, your browser isn't Unicode compliant.--&gt;, and [[Rangpur Division|Rangpur]] (রংপুর).

Divisions are subdivided into districts (''zila''). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into ''upazila'' (subdistricts) or ''thana''. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several ''unions'', with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into ''mahallas''. There are no elected officials at the divisional, district or upazila levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.&lt;ref&gt;''Local Government Act'', No. 20, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dhaka]] is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. Other major cities include [[Chittagong]], [[Khulna]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Sylhet]], [[Barisal]], [[Bogra]], [[Comilla]], [[Mymensingh]] and [[Rangpur, Bangladesh|Rangpur]]. These cities have [[mayor]]al elections, while other municipalities elect a chairperson. Mayors and chairpersons are elected for a span of five years.

[[File:Satellite image of Bangladesh in October 2001.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite image presenting physical features of Bangladesh]]
[[File:CornophulyScene.jpg|thumb|right|[[Karnaphuli River]] in [[Kaptai]], [[Chittagong]].]]

Bangladesh lies between latitudes [[20th parallel north|20°]] and [[27th parallel north|27°N]], and longitudes [[88th meridian east|88°]] and [[93rd meridian east|93°E]].

Bangladesh is in the low-lying [[Ganges]]–[[Brahmaputra]] River Delta or Ganges Delta. This delta is formed by the confluence of the [[Ganges River|Ganges]] (local name [[Padma River|Padma]] or ''Pôdda''), [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]]
([[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] or ''Jomuna'' also known as &quot;Yamuna&quot;), and [[Meghna River|Meghna]] rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna to eventually empty into the Bay of Bengal. The [[Alluvium|alluvial soil]] deposited by these rivers has created some of the most fertile plains in the world. Bangladesh has 57 [[trans-boundary river]]s, making water issues politically complicated to resolve – in most cases as the lower [[riparian zone|riparian]] state to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In south east Bangladesh experiments have been done since the sixties to 'build with nature'. By implementing cross dams, the natural accretion of silt has created new land. With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began to help develop this new land in the late 1970s. The effort has since become a multiagency operation building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers. By fall 2010, the program will have allotted some {{convert|27000|acre|ha|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} to 21,000 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/bangladesh-fights-survival-against-climate-change |title=&quot;Bangladesh fights for survival against climate change,&quot; by William Wheeler and Anna-Katarina Gravgaard, The Washington Times |publisher=Pulitzercenter.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straddling the [[Tropic of Cancer]], Bangladeshi climate is [[Tropics|tropical]] with a mild winter from October to March, a hot, humid summer from March to June. A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall. Natural calamities, such as [[Floods in Bangladesh|floods]], [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[tornado]]es, and [[tidal bore]]s occur almost every year,&lt;ref name=&quot;NatDis&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=David E. |title= Natural Disasters |origdate= |origyear= 1993 |origmonth= |url= http://books.google.com/?id=gWHsuGTcF34C&amp;pg=PA532&amp;dq=bangladesh+natural+disasters |accessdate=2008-05-02 |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year= 1999|month= |publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers|location= Dordrecht |isbn=0412047519 |oclc= 27974924 43782866|doi= |id= |page=532 |chapter=The Third World |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; combined with the effects of [[deforestation]], [[Soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] and [[erosion]].

In September 1998, Bangladesh saw [[1998 Bangladesh floods|the most severe flooding]] in modern world history. As the [[Brahmaputra]], the [[Ganges]] and [[Meghna]] spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, {{convert|9700|km|mi|0}} of road and {{convert|2700|km|mi|0}} of embankment 1,000&amp;nbsp;people were killed and 30&amp;nbsp;million more were made homeless with 135,000 cattle killed, {{convert|50|km2|mi2|1}} of land destroyed and {{convert|11000|km|mi|0}} of roads damaged or destroyed. Two-thirds of the country was underwater.
There were several reasons for the severity of the flooding. Firstly, there were unusually high [[monsoon]] rains. Secondly, the [[Himalayas]] shed off an equally unusually high amount of melt water that year. Thirdly, trees that usually would have intercept rain water had been cut down for firewood or to make space for animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;EWG&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Haggett|first=Peter |title= Encyclopedia of World Geography |origdate= |origyear=2002 |origmonth= |url= http://books.google.com/?id=IROIY4ONOSEC&amp;pg=PA2634&amp;dq=bangladesh+flood+reason |accessdate=2008-05-02 |publisher= Marshall Cavendish |series= |volume= |date= |year= 2002|month= |location= New York |isbn=0761473084 |oclc= 46578454|doi= |id= |pages=2, 634 |chapter=The Indian Subcontinent |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[polypropylene]] products began to substitute for jute products worldwide and the jute industry started to decline.

Obstacles to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, inefficient state-owned enterprises, mismanaged [[port]] facilities, a growth in the labour force that has outpaced jobs, inefficient use of energy resources (such as [[natural gas]]), insufficient power supplies, slow implementation of economic reforms, political infighting and [[Political corruption|corruption]]. According to the World Bank, &quot;among Bangladesh’s most significant obstacles to growth are poor governance and weak public institutions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank-brief&quot;&gt;

Bangladesh has seen expansion of its [[middle class]] (world's [[List of largest consumer markets|Fifty Forth largest]], just below of Singapore &amp; Vietnam), and its [[consumer]] industry has also grown. In December 2005, four years after its report on the emerging &quot;[[BRIC]]&quot; economies ([[Brazil]], Russia, India, and China), [[Goldman Sachs]] named Bangladesh one of the &quot;[[Next Eleven]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;nextele&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000177&amp;sid=aoJ4WG5LSf1s&amp;refer=market_insight |title=South Korea, Another `BRIC' in Global Wall |date=2005-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], [[Vietnam]] and seven other countries.

Bangladesh has seen a dramatic increase in [[foreign direct investment]]. A number of [[multinational corporation]]s and local big business houses such as [[Beximco]], [[SQUARE (Bangladesh)|Square]], [[Akij Group]], [[M. M. Ispahani Limited|Ispahani]], [[Navana Group]], [[Transcom Group]], [[Habib Group]], [[KDS Group]], [[Dragon Group]] and multinationals such as [[Unocal Corporation]] and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], have made major investments, with the natural gas sector being a priority. In December 2005, the [[Bangladesh Bank|Central Bank of Bangladesh]] projected GDP growth around 6.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;bdbank1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangladesh-bank.org/pub/annual/anreport/annual.html |title=Annual Report 2004–2005, Bangladesh Bank |publisher=Bangladesh-bank.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to enhance economic growth, the government set up several export processing zones to attract foreign investment. These are managed by the [[Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority]].

One significant contributor to the development of the economy has been the widespread propagation of [[microcredit]] by [[Muhammad Yunus]] (awarded the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] [[Nobel Peace Prize|peace prize]] in 2006) through the [[Grameen Bank]].

[[File:Pohela boishakh 2.jpg|thumb|right|Celebrations of the [[Pohela Baishakh]] at [[Dhaka]].]]

Reflecting the long history of the region, Bangladesh has a culture that encompasses elements both old and new. The [[Bengali language]] boasts a rich literary heritage, which Bangladesh shares with the Indian state of West Bengal. The earliest literary text in Bengali is the 8th century [[Charyapada]]. Medieval Bengali literature was often either religious (for example, [[Chandidas]]), or adapted from other languages (for example, [[Alaol]]). Bengali literature reached its full expression in the 19th century, with its greatest icons being poets [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]]. Bangladesh also has a long tradition in folk literature, for example ''[[Maimansingha Gitika]]'', ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]'' and stories related to ''[[Gopal Bhar]]'', ''Birbal'' and ''Molla Nasiruddin''.

The musical tradition of Bangladesh is lyrics-based (''Baniprodhan''), with minimal instrumental accompaniment. The [[Baul]] tradition is a distinctive element of Bengali folk music. Numerous other musical traditions exist including [[Gombhira]], [[Bhatiali]] and [[Bhawaiya]], varying from one region to the next. Folk music is often accompanied by the [[ektara]], an instrument with only one string. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol]], [[flute]] and [[tabla]]. Bangladesh also has an active heritage in [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]]. Similarly, Bangladeshi dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Four private FM radio stations named ([[Radio Foorti]], [[ABC Radio Bangladesh|ABC Radio]], [[Radio Today]], [[Radio Amar]]) are popular among urban youths. International Bengali language broadcasts include [[BBC Bangla]] and [[Voice of America]]. The dominant television channel is the state-owned [[Bangladesh Television]], but in the last few years, privately owned channels have developed considerably.

The culinary tradition of Bangladesh has close relations to nearby [[North East Indian cuisine|North-East Indian]] and [[Middle Eastern cuisine]] as well as having its own unique traits. Rice, and fish are traditional favorites. Bangladeshis make distinctive [[confectionary|sweetmeats]] from milk products, some common ones being ''[[Rasgulla|Rôshogolla]]'', ''Rasmalai|Rôshomalai'', ''chômchôm'' and ''kalojam''.

The [[sari]] ''(shaŗi)'' is by far the most widely worn dress by Bangladeshi women. A guild of weavers in Dhaka is renowned for producing saris from exquisite [[Jamdani]] [[muslin]]. The [[salwar kameez]] ''(shaloar kamiz)'' is also quite popular, and in urban areas some women wear western attire. Among men, western attire is more widely adopted. Men also wear the ''[[kurta]]-paejama'' combination, often on religious occasions, and the [[lungi]], a kind of long skirt for men.

[[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]], being the most important holidays in the Islamic calendar, are the subject of major festivals. The day before Eid ul-Fitr is called ''Chãd Rat'' (the night of the moon) and is often celebrated with firecrackers. [[Eid ul-Adha]] is celebrated in the memory of great sacrifice of [[Prophet]] [[Abraham]]. Major Hindu festivals are [[Durga Puja]], [[Kali Puja]] and [[Saraswati Puja]]. [[Vesak|Buddha Purnima]], which marks the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]], and [[Christmas]], called ''Bôŗodin'' (Great day), are both [[Public holidays in Bangladesh|national holidays]]. The most important secular festival is [[Pohela Baishakh]] or Bengali New Year, the beginning of the Bengali calendar. Other festivities include [[Nobanno]], ''Poush parbon'' (festival of [[Poush]]) and observance of national days like [[Language Movement Day|Shohid Dibosh]] and [[Victory Day (Bangladesh)|Victory Day]].

== Education ==
The educational system in Bangladesh is three-tiered and highly subsidized. The government of Bangladesh operates many schools in the primary, secondary, and higher secondary levels. It also subsidizes parts of the funding for many private schools. In the tertiary education sector, the government also funds more than 15 state universities through the [[University Grants Commission of Bangladesh|University Grants Commission]].

Primary (from grades 1 to 5), Secondary (from grades 6 to 10), Higher Secondary (from grades 11 to 12) and tertiary.&lt;ref name=CompEd&gt;{{Cite book|author=T. Neville Postlethwaite|title=The Encyclopedia of Comparative Education and National Systems of Education|page=130|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1988|isbn=0080308538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five years of lower secondary education concludes with a Secondary School Certificate (SSC) Examination. Students who pass this examination proceed to two years of Higher Secondary or intermediate training, which culminate in a Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) Examination.&lt;ref name=CompEd/&gt; Education is mainly offered in Bangla, but English is also commonly taught and used. A large number of Muslim families send their children to attend part-time courses or even to pursue full-time religious education, which is imparted in Bangla and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in madrasahs.&lt;ref name=CompEd/&gt;

Bangladesh conforms fully to the [[Education For All]] (EFA) objectives, the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) and international declarations. &lt;!-- Who set the EFA and MDG declarations? --&gt; Article 17 of the [[Bangladesh Constitution]] provides that all children between the ages of six and ten years receive a basic education free of charge.

Universities in Bangladesh are mainly categorized into three different types: Public university (government owned and subsidized), Private University (private sector owned universities), and International University (operated and funded by international organizations )

Bangladesh has 30 public universities where [[Bangladesh National University|National University]] is the Largest one and  [[University of Dhaka]], established in 1921, is the oldest university of the country. Bangladeshi universities are affiliated with the [[University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC), a commission created according to the Presidential Order (P.O. No 10 of 1973) of the Government of the [[People's Republic of Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moedu.gov.bd/about_moe__organizations_ugc.htm |title=University Grant Commission (UGC) |accessdate=2008-03-29 |work=Ministry of Education, Government of Bangladesh |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080318232408/http://moedu.gov.bd/about_moe__organizations_ugc.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cricket]] enjoys a passionate following in Bangladesh and it is the most popular sport followed by [[association football|football (soccer)]]. The [[Bangladesh national cricket team|national cricket team]] participated in their first [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] in 1999, and the following year was granted elite [[Test cricket]] status. But they have struggled to date, recording only three [[test cricket|Test match]] victories,one against [[Zimbabwe]] in 2005 and the other two in a series win of 2-0 against the [[West Indies]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/8160263.stm |title=BBC News |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-07-20 |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, 2010, they celebrated their first ever win over [[England]] in any form of match. Later in 2010,they managed to whitewash [[New Zealand]] for the first time in history. In 2011, Bangladesh co-hosted the [[ICC Cricket World Cup 2011]] with [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. 

In Asian Games 2010 in Guangzhou they defeated Afghanistan to claim Gold Medal in the first ever cricket tournament held in Asian Games.

===Etymology===
According to accounts by descendants of the indigenous [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]-speaking tribes in other regional areas, the original name for Barbados was '''Ichirouganaim''', with possible translations including &quot;Red Land with White Teeth&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= |first1= |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Barbados the Red Land with White Teeth:  Home of the Amerindians |trans_title= |url=http://www.barbmuse.org.bb/ |accessdate=14 May 2010 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1998 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Barbados Museum &amp; Historical Society |location= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |at= |trans_chapter= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=A temporary exhibit which examined some of the preliminary excavations conducted at the dig site at Heywoods, St. Peter. |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Redstone island with teeth outside (reefs)&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= |first1= |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Barbados – Geography / History |trans_title= |url=http://www.coucouandflyingfish.com/main/where.html |accessdate=14 May 2010 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2008 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Fun 'N' Sun Publishing Inc. |location= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |at= |trans_chapter= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply &quot;Teeth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pantribalconfederacy.com/confederacy/News/pdf/guyana_consul_visit.pdf |title=Guyana Consul (Barbados) Visit to Former Amerindian Village Site in B'dos |first=Norman |last=Faria |author=|authorlink= |coauthors= |date=17 |month=June |year=2009 |work=Guyana Chronicle newspaper |publisher=Pan-Tribal Confederacy of Indigenous Tribal Nations |location= |page=Pg 2. |pages= |at= |trans_title= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=14 May 2010 |quote=Adjacent to the park, there is still a fresh water stream.

The reason for the later name Barbados is controversial. The [[History of Portugal (1415-1542)|Portuguese]], en route to [[Brazil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barbados.org/history1.htm |title=AXSES Systems Caribbean Inc., The Barbados Tourism Encyclopaedia |publisher=Barbados.org |date=8 February 2007 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/52655/Barbados/54603/History |title=Britannica Encyclopaedia: History of Barbados |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the first Europeans to come upon the island, and they named it Barbados. The word ''Barbados'' means &quot;bearded ones&quot;, but it is a matter of conjecture whether &quot;bearded&quot; refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree (''[[Ficus citrifolia]]''), indigenous to the island; to allegedly bearded [[Carib people|Caribs]] once inhabiting the island; or to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] mapmaker [[Visconte Maggiolo]] showed and named Barbados in its correct position.

Other names or nicknames associated with Barbados include &quot;Bim&quot;, &quot;Bimshire&quot; and &quot;da Rock&quot;. The origin is uncertain but several theories exist. The [[National Cultural Foundation]] of Barbados says that &quot;Bim&quot; was a word commonly used by [[slave]]s and that it derives from the phrase &quot;bi mu&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncf.bb/index.php?ZZZ=570_1051 National Cultural Foundation]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or either (&quot;bem&quot;, &quot;Ndi bem&quot;, &quot;Nwanyi ibem&quot; or &quot;Nwoke ibem&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Carrington, Sean 2007 25&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Carrington, Sean |title=A~Z of Barbados Heritage |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan Caribbean Publishers Limited|page=25 |isbn=0-333-92068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; from an [[Igbo people|Igbo]] phrase meaning &quot;my people&quot;. In colloquial or literary contexts, &quot;Bim&quot; can also take a more deific tone, referring to the &quot;goddess&quot; Barbados.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The word ''Bim'' and ''Bimshire'' are recorded in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and the Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionaries.
Another possible source for &quot;Bim&quot; is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, The Rev. N Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were &quot;Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire and Bimshire&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carrington, Sean 2007 25&quot; /&gt;
Lastly in the Daily Argosy (of Demerara i.e. Guyana) of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word &quot;Byam&quot;, who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carrington, Sean 2007 25&quot; /&gt;

===Early history===
[[Amerindian]] settlement of Barbados dates to about the 4th to 7th century AD, by a group known as  the Saladoid-Barrancoid.&lt;ref&gt;
A History of Barbados: From Amerindian Settlement to Caribbean Single Market by Hilary McD. Beckles (Cambridge University Press, 2007 edition)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, the [[Caribs]] arrived from South America.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCTP&quot;&gt;UCTP&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] briefly claimed Barbados from the mid-16th to the 17th centuries, and may have seized the Arawaks on Barbados and used them as [[slavery|slave labour]]. Other Arawaks are believed to have fled to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Portuguese left little impact and by the 1610s left for South America, leaving the island uninhabited. Some Arawaks arrived from Guyana in the 1800s and continue to live in Barbados.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCTP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantribalconfederacy.com/confederacy/history.php An Abbreviated Synopsys of Eagle Clan Arawak History

===British colonial rule===
English sailors who landed on Barbados in 1625 arrived at the site of present-day [[Holetown]]. The English then took possession of Barbados in the name of [[James I of England|James I]]. From the arrival of the first English settlers in 1627–1628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted British governance (and was the only Caribbean island that did not change hands during the colonial period). Nevertheless, Barbados always enjoyed a large measure of local autonomy. Its [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] began meeting in 1639. Among the initial important figures was Anglo-Dutchman Sir [[William Courten]].

Fighting during the [[War of the Three Kingdoms]] and the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] spilled over into Barbados and Barbadian territorial waters. The island was not [[English Revolution in the Colonies|involved in the war]] until after the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], when the island's government fell under the control of Royalists (ironically the Governor, Philip Bell, remained loyal to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] while the Barbadian [[House of Assembly]], under the influence of Humphrey Walrond, supported [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]). To try to bring the recalcitrant colony to heel, the [[Rump Parliament#Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth Parliament]] passed an act on 3 October 1650 which prohibited trade between England and the island, and because the island also traded with the [[Netherlands]], further [[navigation acts]] were passed prohibiting any but English vessels trading with [[Dutch colonies#Atlantic|Dutch colonies]]. These acts were a precursor to the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]]. The [[Commonwealth of England]] sent an invasion force under the command of [[George Ayscue|Sir George Ayscue]] which arrived in October 1651. After some skirmishing, the Royalists supporters in the Barbados House of Assembly led by [[Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham|Lord Willoughby]] surrendered. The conditions of surrender were incorporated into the [[Charter of Barbados]] (Treaty of Oistins), which was signed in the Mermaid's Inn, [[Oistins]], on 17 January 1652.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Watson, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/barbados_01.shtml The Civil War in Barbados], British History in-depth , BBC, 5 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increased implementation of [[Barbados Slave Code|slave codes]], which created differential treatment between Africans and the white workers and planters, the island became increasingly unattractive to [[redlegs|poor whites]]. Black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. In response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. However, an increasingly repressive legal system caused the gap between the treatment of typically white indentured servants and black slaves to widen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Imported slaves became much more attractive for the rich planters who would increasingly dominate the island not only economically but also politically.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. Planters expanded their importation of African slaves to cultivate sugar cane. The inhabitants of Barbados shifted from mainly English and [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] in the 17th century to overwhelmingly black by the end of the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Barbados eventually had one of the world's biggest sugar industries after starting sugar cane cultivation in 1640.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Arif Ali |title=Barbados: Just Beyond Your Imagination |pages=46, 48 |year=1997 |publisher=Hansib Publishing (Caribbean) Ltd |isbn=1870518543 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One group which was instrumental for ensuring the early success of the sugar cane industry were the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jews]], who originally been expelled from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to end up in [[Dutch Brazil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;beyond&quot;/&gt; This quickly replaced tobacco plantations on the islands which were previously the main export. As the sugar industry developed into its main commercial enterprise, Barbados was divided into large plantation estates that replaced the smallholdings of the early English settlers. Some of the displaced farmers moved to other English colonies in the Americas, most notably [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]], and [[British Guiana]], as well as [[Panama]]. To work the plantations, planters imported enslaved West Africans to Barbados and other Caribbean islands.

The British abolished the [[slave trade]] in 1807 but not the institution itself. In 1816, slaves rose up in the largest major slave rebellion in the island's history. Twenty thousand slaves from over 70 plantations rebelled. They drove whites off the plantations, but widespread killings did not take place. This was later termed “Bussa's Rebellion” after the slave ranger, [[Bussa]], who with his assistants hated slavery, found the treatment of slaves on Barbados to be “intolerable”, and believed the political climate in the UK made the time ripe to peacefully negotiate with planters for freedom (Davis, p.&amp;nbsp;211; Northrup, p.&amp;nbsp;191). Bussa's Rebellion failed. One hundred and twenty slaves died in combat or were immediately executed; another 144 were brought to trial and executed; remaining rebels were shipped off the island (Davis, pp.&amp;nbsp;212–213).

Slavery was finally abolished in the British Empire 18 years later in 1834. In Barbados and the rest of the British West Indian colonies, full emancipation from slavery was preceded by an apprenticeship period that lasted four years.

In 1884, the Barbados Agricultural Society sent a letter to [[Francis Hincks|Sir Francis Hincks]] requesting his private and public views on whether the Dominion of Canada would favourably entertain having the then colony of Barbados admitted as a member of the Canadian Confederation. Asked of [[Canada]] were the terms of the Canadian side to initiate discussions, and whether or not the island of Barbados could depend on the full influence of Canada in getting the change agreed to by the United Kingdom. Then in 1952 the ''[[Barbados Advocate]]'' newspaper polled several prominent Barbadian politicians, lawyers, businessmen, the Speaker of the [[Barbados House of Assembly]] and later as first President of the [[Senate of Barbados|Senate]], Sir Theodore Branker, Q.C. and found them to be in favour of immediate federation of Barbados along with the rest of the British [[Caribbean]] with complete Dominion Status within five years from the date of inauguration of the [[West Indies Federation]] with Canada.

However, plantation owners and merchants of British descent still dominated local politics, owing to the high-income qualification required for voting. More than 70% of the population, many of them disenfranchised women, were excluded from the democratic process. It was not until the 1930s that the descendants of emancipated slaves began a movement for political rights. One of the leaders of this movement, [[Sir Grantley Adams]], founded the [[Barbados Labour Party]] in 1938, then known as the Barbados Progressive League.

Adams and his party demanded more rights for the poor and for the people, and staunchly supported the monarchy. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949 governmental control was wrested from the planters and, in 1958, Adams became Premier of Barbados.

From 1958 to 1962, Barbados was one of the ten members of the [[West Indies Federation]], an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power. Adams served as its first and only &quot;Premier&quot;, but his leadership failed in attempts to form similar unions, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country. [[Errol Walton Barrow]], a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the [[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, such as free education for all Barbadians and the school meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.

With the Federation dissolved, Barbados reverted to its former status, that of a [[self-governing colony]]. The island negotiated its own independence at a constitutional conference with Britain in June 1966. After years of peaceful and democratic progress, Barbados finally became an independent state on 30 November 1966, with Errol Barrow its first Prime Minister, although Queen Elizabeth II remained the monarch. Upon independence Barbados maintained historical linkages with Britain by establishing membership to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] grouping. A year later Barbados' international linkages were expanded by obtaining membership to the United Nations and the [[Organization of American States]].

==Government and politics==
[[File:Bridgetown barbados parliament building.jpg|thumb|right|Parliament Building.]]
{{Main|Government of Barbados|Politics of Barbados}}
Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]], modelled on the British [[Westminster system]], with [[Elizabeth II]], [[Queen of Barbados]], as [[head of state]] represented locally by the [[List of Governors-General of Barbados|Governor-General]], [[Clifford Husbands]] and the [[Prime Minister of Barbados|Prime Minister]] as the [[head of the government]]. The number of representatives within the [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] has gradually increased from 24 at independence, to its present composition of thirty seats.

Barbados functions as a [[two-party system]], the two dominant parties being the ruling [[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] and the opposition, [[Barbados Labour Party]]. The Barbados Labour Party (BLP) had been in government for 15 years, since 1993 until the 2008 general election. Under this administration, the former Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur acted as the Regional Leader of the CSM (Caribbean Single Market).

The Honourable [[David Thompson (Barbadian politician)|David Thompson]], who was elected Prime Minister of Barbados in 2008, died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on 23 October 2010. He was succeeded by Deputy Prime Minister Freundel Stewart, who was sworn in the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caribbean360.com/News/Caribbean/Stories/2008/01/16/NEWS0000005329.html |title=Caribbean: News in the Caribbean - Caribbean360.com |publisher=Caribbean360.com&lt;! |date= |accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/10/23/barbados.prime.minister.obit/index.html?hpt=T2 | work=CNN | title=Barbados PM dies at 48 | date=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbados has had several third parties over a period of time since independence: The People's Pressure Movement formed in the early 1970s and contested the 1976 elections; The National Democratic Party, which contested the 1994 elections; and the People's Democratic Congress, which contested the 2008 elections. Apart from these there were several independents who contested the elections, but independents are yet to win a seat in Parliament.

Currently the leading party of the country is the DLP, Democratic Labour Party. The DLP defeated the BLP, Barbados Labour Party, in the last election in 2008. This was a surprise since the BLP had political power for over 14 years.

===Law===
The Constitution of Barbados is the supreme law of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caricomlaw.org/doc_dl.php?id=656 The official Constitution of Barbados] (2006) version.&lt;/ref&gt; The Attorney General heads the independent [[judiciary]]. Historically, Barbadian law was based entirely on [[English common law]] with a few local adaptations. At the time of independence, the [[British Parliament]] ceased having the ability to change local legislation at its own discretion. British law and various legal statutes within British law at this time, and other prior measures adopted by the Barbadian parliament became the basis of the modern-day law system.

More recently, however, local Barbadian legislation may be shaped or influenced by such organisations as the United Nations, the [[Organization of American States]], or other international fora to which Barbados has obligatory commitments by treaty. Additionally, through international cooperation, other institutions may supply the Barbados Parliament with key sample legislation to be adapted to meet local circumstances before crafting it as local law.

Laws are passed by the Barbadian Parliament, whereby upon their passage, are given official [[viceroy|vice-regal]] assent by the Governor-General to become law.

In Barbados, [[camouflage]] clothing is reserved for military use and forbidden for civilians to wear.

As of October 2010, it is illegal for persons to smoke in public areas.

===Courts===
{{main|Judiciary of Barbados}}
The local court system of Barbados is made-up of:
*Magistrates' Courts: Covering Criminal, Civil, Domestic, Domestic Violence, and Juvenile matters. But can also take up matters dealing with Corornor's Inquests, Liquor Licences, and civil marriages. Further, the Magistrates' Courts deal with Contract and Tort law where claims do not exceed $10,000.00.&lt;ref name=&quot;court&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawcourts.gov.bb/Aboutus.html |title=Law Courts of Barbados |publisher=Lawcourts.gov.bb |date= |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Supreme Court of Barbados|Supreme Court]]: is made up of High Court and Court of Appeals.&lt;ref name=&quot;court&quot; /&gt;
**High Court: Consisting of Civil, Criminal, and Family law divisions.
**Court of Appeal: Handles appeals from the High Court and Magistrates' Court. It hears appeals in both the civil, and criminal law jurisdictions. It may consist of a single Justice of Appeal sitting in Chambers; or may sit as a Full Court of three Justices of Appeals.
*The [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ), (based in [[Port Of Spain]], Trinidad and Tobago), is the court of last resort (final jurisdiction) over Barbadian law. It replaced the London-based [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] (JCPC). The CCJ may resolve other disputed matters dealing with the [[Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy]] (CSME).

Barbados is a full and participating member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), [[Caribbean Single Market and Economy]] (CSME), and the [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://barbadosbusiness.gov.bb/miib/Barbados/regional_links.cfm BarbadosBusiness.gov.bb], The Barbados Government's Regional and International affiliations]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ), which currently pertains only to Barbados and [[Guyana]]. In 2001 the Caribbean Community heads of government voted on a measure declaring that the region should work towards replacing the UK's [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] with the Caribbean Court of Justice.

Barbados is an original Member (1995) of the World Trade Organisation(WTO), and participates actively in its work. It grants at least MFN treatment to all its trading partners. As of December 2007 Barbados is linked by an [[Economic Partnership Agreement]] with the [[European Commission]]. The pact involves the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM) subgroup of the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|Group of African, Caribbean, and Pacific states]] (ACP). CARIFORUM presently the only part of the wider ACP-bloc that has concluded the full regional trade-pact with the European Union.

Trade policy has also sought to protect a small number of domestic activities, mostly food production, from foreign competition, while recognizing that most domestic needs are best met by imports. This protection, and limited competition in certain domestic sectors have weighed on the competitiveness of the leading service activities by restricting their access to inputs at the lowest cost. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Geography and climate==
{{Main|Geography and climate of Barbados}}
[[File:Barbados.gif|right|thumb|Map of Barbados]]
[[File:Barbados beach.jpg|thumb|left|Beach near [[Bridgetown]], Barbados.]]

Barbados is the easternmost island in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It is flat in comparison to its island neighbours to the west, the [[Windward Islands]]. The island rises gently to the central highland region, with the highpoint of the nation being [[Mount Hillaby]], in the [[Scotland District]], {{convert|340|m|ft|abbr=off}} above sea level. The island is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, east of the other [[West Indies Islands]].

[[Geology|Geologically]] composed of [[coral]] ({{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=/}} thick), the land falls in a series of &quot;terraces&quot; in the west and goes into an incline in the east. Much of the country is circled by coral reefs.

In the parish of [[Saint Michael, Barbados|Saint Michael]] lies Barbados' capital and main city, [[Bridgetown]]. Other major towns scattered across the island include [[Holetown]], in the parish of [[Saint James, Barbados|Saint James]]; [[Oistins]], in the parish of [[Christ Church, Barbados|Christ Church]]; and [[Speightstown]], in the parish of [[Saint Peter, Barbados|Saint Peter]].

The [[climate]] is moderate tropical, with a [[wet season]] (June–November) and a more [[dry season]] (December–May). The annual precipitation ranges between {{convert|40|in|mm}} and {{convert|90|in|mm}}.

Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's [[tropical storm]]s and [[hurricanes]] during the rainy season as its far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts it just outside the principal [[hurricane strike zone]]. On average a hurricane may strike about once every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was [[Hurricane Janet]] in 1955.

== Parishes ==
{{Main|Parishes of Barbados}}
[[File:Barbados parishes numbered.png|thumb|right|Map of the parishes of Barbados]]
Barbados is [[divided]] into 11 parishes:

#[[Christ Church, Barbados|Christ Church]]
#[[Saint Andrew, Barbados|Saint Andrew]]
#[[Saint George, Barbados|Saint George]]
#[[Saint James, Barbados|Saint James]]
#[[Saint John, Barbados|Saint John]]
#[[Saint Joseph, Barbados|Saint Joseph]]
#[[Saint Lucy, Barbados|Saint Lucy]]
#[[Saint Michael, Barbados|Saint Michael]]
#[[Saint Peter, Barbados|Saint Peter]]
#[[Saint Philip, Barbados|Saint Philip]]
#[[Saint Thomas, Barbados|Saint Thomas]]

St. George and St. Thomas located in the middle of the country are the only two parishes without coastlines.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Barbados}}
Barbados is the 51st [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|richest country in the world]] in terms of GDP (Gross domestic product) per capita,&lt;ref name=imf2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2007&amp;ey=2014&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=47&amp;pr1.y=14&amp;c=316&amp;s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&amp;grp=0&amp;a= |title=Barbados |publisher=International Monetary Fund |accessdate=1 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a well-developed [[mixed economy]], and a moderately high [[standard of living]]. According to the World Bank, Barbados is classified as being in its 66 top [[High income economy|High income economies]] of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20421402~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html#High_income World Bank – Country Groups.]. Retrieved 5 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on [[sugarcane]] cultivation and related activities, but in the late 1970s and early 1980s it has diversified into the manufacturing and tourism sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. Since the 1990s the Barbados Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Recent government administrations have continued efforts to reduce unemployment, encourage [[foreign direct investment]], and privatise remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced from around 14 percent in the past to under 10 percent. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]], but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Traditional trading partners include Canada, the [[Caribbean Community]] (especially [[Trinidad and Tobago]]), the United Kingdom and the United States.

Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada [[Canadian dollar|CA$]] 25&amp;nbsp;billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI). Businessman [[Eugene Melnyk]] of [[Toronto]], Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

It has been reported that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi-million dollar commercial projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.nationnews.com/story/285076846570648.php |title=Builders paradise |accessdate=29 July 2009 |first=Roy |last=Morris |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2 January 2006 |month=01 |work=The Nation Newspaper |pages= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060104024455/http://www.nationnews.com/story/285076846570648.php |archivedate=4 January 2009 |quote=Industry sources are warning, however, that while the boom will bring many jobs and much income, ordinary Barbadians hoping to undertake home construction or improvement will be hard pressed to find materials or labour, given the large number of massive commercial projects with which they will have to compete. [ . . . ] Construction magnate Sir Charles 'COW' Williams, agreeing that this year will be &quot;without doubt&quot; the biggest ever for the island as far as construction was concerned, revealed that his organisation was in the final stages of the construction of a new $6&amp;nbsp;million plant at Lears, St Michael to double its capacity to produce concrete blocks, as well as a new $2&amp;nbsp;million plant to supply ready-mixed concrete from its fleet of trucks.

&quot;The important thing to keep in mind is that the country will benefit tremendously from a massive injection of foreign exchange from people who want to own homes here,&quot; Sir Charles said. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union is presently assisting Barbados with a €10&amp;nbsp;million programme of modernisation of the country's International Business and Financial Services Sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-17865--26-26--.html |title=Barbados signs agreement with EU |accessdate=29 July 2009 |first=Cathy |last=Lashley |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=24 July 2009 |month=07 |work=Caribbean Net News |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbados maintains the third largest [[Barbados Stock Exchange|stock exchange]] in the Caribbean region. At present, officials at the stock exchange are investigating the possibility of augmenting the local exchange with an International Securities Market (ISM) venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.barbadosadvocate.com/newsitem.asp?more=business&amp;NewsID=5140 |title=Treaty network an advantage in securities trading |accessdate=28 July 2009 |first=R |last=H |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=28 July 2009 |month=07 |work=[[Barbados Advocate]] |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Barbados}}
[[File:BdsZRNov95.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Typical ZR-van with markings indicating that it serves the number 11 route.]]
Transport on the island is relatively convenient, with '[[share taxis|route taxis]]', called &quot;ZRs&quot; (pronounced &quot;[[Z]]ed-Rs&quot;), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down, regardless of the number. However, they will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital [[Bridgetown]] or from [[Speightstown, Barbados|Speightstown]] in the northern part of the island.
[[File:BM322Nov95.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Old Barbados Transport Board bus in Bridgetown.]]
Including the ZRs there are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays). There's ZRs, the yellow minibuses and the blue [[Barbados Transport Board|Transport Board buses]]. A ride on any of them costs BBD$2.00. The smaller buses from the two privately owned systems (&quot;ZRs&quot; and &quot;minibuses&quot;) can give change; the larger blue buses from the government-operated [[Barbados Transport Board]] system cannot, but do give receipts. Children in school uniform ride for free on the Government buses and for $1.00 on the minibuses and ZRs. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.

[[File:Mini moke.jpg|thumb|A [[Mini Moke]] at [[Speightstown]] beach]]
Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally owned and operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national companies.

The island's lone airport is the [[Grantley Adams International Airport]]. It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the eastern Caribbean. It is undergoing a US$100&amp;nbsp;million upgrade and expansion.

There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and maritime traffic is regulated by the [[Barbados Port Authority]].

==Tourism==
Barbados has numerous internationally known hotels. Time-shares are available, and many of the smaller local hotels and private villas which dot the island have space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of Barbados are popular, with the calm light blue Caribbean Sea and their white and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast, which faces the Atlantic Ocean, there are tumbling waves which are perfect for light [[surfing]]. Some areas remain risky due to under-tow currents.

[[Shopping]] districts are popular in Barbados, with ample [[duty-free]] shopping. There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the [[Saint Lawrence Gap, Christ Church, Barbados|Saint Lawrence Gap]]. Other attractions include wildlife reserves, jewelry stores, [[scuba diving]], helicopter rides, golf, festivals (the largest being the annual [[Crop Over]] festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave exploration, exotic [[drink]]s and fine clothes [[shopping]].

===Attractions, landmarks and points of interest===
Tourism accounts for almost one half of the economy.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Barbados|Barbadian people}}
[[File:Barbados bus stop.jpg|thumb|right|A bus stop in Barbados]]
[[File:High street Barbados.jpg|right|thumb|High Street]]
Barbados has a population of about 281,968 and a population growth rate of 0.33% (Mid-2005 estimates). Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as ''Bajan'') are of African descent (&quot;Afro-Bajans&quot;).  The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans (&quot;Anglo-Bajans&quot; / &quot;Euro-Bajans&quot;) mainly from the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Chinese, Bajan Muslims from India.
Other groups in Barbados include people from the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. Barbadians who return after years of residence in the U.S. and children born in America to Bajan parents are called &quot;Bajan Yankees&quot; {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, this term is considered derogatory by some.

The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:

# The [[Indo-Guyanese]], an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country [[Guyana]]. There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and [[India]]. They introduced [[roti]] and many Indian dishes to Barbados' culture. Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, these 'Desi' peoples are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad &amp; Guyana.
# Euro-Bajans (4% of the population)&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; have settled in Barbados since the 16th century, originating from England, Ireland and [[Scotland]]. In 1643, there were 37,200 whites in Barbados (86% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/barbados_03.shtml Population], ''Slavery and Economy in Barbados'', BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly they are known as &quot;[[White Barbadian|White Bajans]]&quot;. Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as [[Irish music]] and Highland music, and certain place names, such as &quot;Scotland&quot;, a mountainous region, and &quot;Trafalgar Square&quot; in Bridgetown, now renamed &quot;Heroes Square&quot;. Among White Barbadians there exists an underclass known as [[Redlegs]]; the descendants of [[indentured servants]], and prisoners imported to the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irlandeses.org/0711rodgers2.htm The Irish in the Caribbean 1641–1837: An Overview], By Nini Rodgers, Society for Irish Latin American Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Many additionally moved on to become the earliest settlers of modern-day [[Province of Carolina|North]] and [[Colonial period of South Carolina|South Carolina]] in the United States.
# Chinese are a minute portion of Barbados' Asian demographics, far smaller than the equivalent communities of [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad]]. Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the Second World War, originating mainly from the then British territory of Hong Kong. Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
# Lebanese and Syrians form the [[Arab]] community on the island and the Muslim minority among them make up a small percentage of the [[Muslim]] population. The majority of the Lebanese and Syrians arrived in Barbados due to trade opportunities. Although in the numbers are dwindling due to emigration and immigration to other countries.
# Jewish people arrived in Barbados just after the first settlers in 1627. Bridgetown is the home of the oldest Jewish Synagogue in the Americas, dating from 1654, though the current structure was erected in 1833 replacing one ruined by the hurricane of 1831. Tombstones in the neighboring cemetery date from the 1630s. Now under the care of the Barbados National Trust the site was deserted in 1929, but was subsequently saved and restored by the Jewish community in 1983.
# Indians from Gujarat in India make up majority of the Muslim population. Muslim-Indian Barbadians are often perceived to be the most successful group in business, along with the Chinese Bajans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The average life expectancy is 77 years for both males and females. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Barbados and Japan have the distinction of having highest number of centenarians (on a per capita basis) in the world.

===Languages===
English is the root [[official language]] of Barbados, and is used for communications, administration, and public services all over the island. In its capacity as the official language of the country, the standard of English tends to conform to the vocabulary, pronunciations, spellings, and conventions akin to, but not exactly the same as, those of [[British English]]. A regional variant of English, referred to locally as [[Bajan Creole|Bajan]], is spoken by most Barbadians in everyday life, especially in informal settings. In its full-fledged form, Bajan sounds markedly different from the Standard English heard on the island.

The degree of intelligibility between Bajan and general English changes depending on the speakers' origins and the &quot;rawness&quot; of one's accent. In rare instances, a Bajan speaker may be completely unintelligible to an outside English speaker if sufficient [[slang]] terminology is present in a sentence. Bajan is somewhat differentiated from, but highly influenced by other [[Caribbean English]] dialects; it is a fusion of [[British English]] and elements borrowed from the languages of West Africa. [[Hindi]] and [[Bhojpuri]] are also spoken on the island by a small Indo-Bajan minority. Spanish is considered the most popular second language on the island, followed by French. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Barbados}}
Most Barbadians of African and European descent are Christians (95%), chiefly [[Anglican Communion|Anglicans]] (40%). Other Christian denominations with significant followings in Barbados are the Roman Catholic Church, [[Jehovah's Witness]]es, [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] and [[Spiritual Baptist]]s. The [[Church of England]] was the official state religion until its legal disenfranchisement by the Parliament of Barbados following independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=www.redspider.biz, Rajkumar Singh |url=http://www.caricomlaw.org/doc.php?id=179Barbados |title=Parliament: Act of Parliament concerning the Anglican church |publisher=Caricomlaw.org |date=20 January 2006 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious minorities include [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Islam in Barbados|Muslims]], the [[Baha'i Faith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bci.org/barbados/Bahai/The_Bahais_Of_Barbados.html |title=Welcome to the Barbados Baha’i Website |publisher=Bci.org |date= |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barbadian Jews|Jews]].

==Healthcare==
Similar to other nations within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] all Barbadian citizens are covered by [[national healthcare]]. Barbados has over twenty [[polyclinic]]s throughout the country in addition to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (General Hospital) located in Bridgetown.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Barbados}}
Education in Barbados is fashioned after the British model. The government of Barbados spends roughly 20% of its annual national budget on education. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} All young people in the country must attend school until age 16. Barbados' [[List of countries by literacy rate|literacy rate]] is ranked close to 100%, with both UNESCO and the Minister of Education stating that Barbados was in the top 5 countries worldwide for literacy rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Y. |last=B. |title='Our literacy rating in Top 5'  |url=http://www.nationnews.com/story/jones-on-literacy-copy-for-web |newspaper=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Nation Newspaper]]  |date=9 September 2009|accessdate=11 September 2009 |quote=Mere days after deputy principal of the Erdiston Teachers' Training College, Dr Patricia Saul, suggested the touted 98 per cent literacy rate was a myth, Minister of Education and Human Resources Development Ronald Jones said the country was ranked among the highest in the world.

&quot;In a world where there are still some 776&amp;nbsp;million adults who are illiterate, and some 75&amp;nbsp;million children who are out of school, we are proud to say that we have free education from the nursery to tertiary level and our literacy rate is still among the highest in the world—fourth in the world, and that is exceptionally high,&quot; Jones said.

Speaking at yesterday's Literacy Fair in Queen's Park, Jones said teachers, principals, parents, students and all those involved in the process needed to be applauded for &quot;keeping us on that edge&quot;.}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus placing the country alongside many of the industrialised nations of the world. Barbados has over 70 primary schools, and over 20 secondary schools throughout the island. There are also a number of private schools catering to various teaching models including [[Montessori]] and [[International Baccalaureate]]. Degree level education in the country is provided by the Barbados Community College, the Samuel Jackman Prescod Polytechnic, and a local [[Cave Hill, Saint Michael, Barbados|Cave Hill campus]] of the [[University of the West Indies]]

==Culture==
[[File:Rihanna in Last Girl on Earth Tour 16-04-3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rihanna]] is from Barbados.]]

{{Main|Culture of Barbados}}
{{See also|Music of Barbados}}
The influence of the English on Barbados is more noticeable than on other islands in the West Indies. A good example of this is the island's national sport: [[cricket]]. Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers, including Sir [[Garfield Sobers]] and [[Frank Worrell]].

Citizens are officially called Barbadians; Bajans (pronounced: &quot;bay&quot; &quot;jan&quot; ), The term &quot;Bajan&quot; may have come from a localised pronunciation of the word Barbadian which at times can sound more like &quot;Bar-bajan&quot;.

The largest [[carnival]]-like cultural event which takes place on the island is the ''[[Crop Over]]'' festival. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries, ''Crop Over'' is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to the island to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities. The male and female Barbadian that harvested the most sugarcane are also crowned as the King and Queen of the crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.2camels.com/crop-over-festival.php |title=Crop Over Festival |publisher=2camels.com |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gets under way from the beginning of July, and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.

In the music business, [[Rihanna]] is currently one of Barbados' most well known [[Grammy awards|grammy winning]] artists. As of 2009 she was appointed as an official Honourary Ambassador of youth and culture for Barbados by the late Prime Minister, [[David Thompson (Barbadian politician)|David Thompson]]. In 2008, Barbados recognized her achievements on &quot;Rihanna Day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zimbio.com/Rihanna,+Pon+de+Replay/articles/166/RIHANNA+DAY+BARBADOS+HONORS+RIHANNA+NAMES&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
{{Main|Sport in Barbados}}

As in other Caribbean countries of British colonial heritage, [[cricket]] is very popular on the island. Barbadians play on the [[West Indies cricket team]]. In addition to several warm-up matches and six &quot;Super Eight&quot; matches, and the country hosted the final of the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. They have had many great cricketers such as [[Sir Garfield Sobers]], [[Sir Frank Worrell]], [[Sir Clyde Walcott]], [[Sir Everton Weekes]], [[Gordon Greenidge]], [[Joel Garner]] and [[Malcolm Marshall]].

[[Obadele Thompson]] is a world class [[sprint (running)|sprinter]] from Barbados; he won a bronze medal at Olympic Games over 100m in 2000. [[Ryan Brathwaite]], a hurdler, reached the 2008 Olympic semi-finals in Beijing. Brathwaite also earned Barbados its first ever medal at the world championships in Berlin, Germany on 20 August 2009, when he won the men's 110 meter hurdles title. The 21-year-old timed a national record of 13.14 seconds to win the Gold Medal.

[[Polo]] is very popular amongst the rich 'elite' on the island and the 'High-Goal' [[Apes Hill]] team is based in the St James's Club.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apeshillclub.com/Polo/&lt;/ref&gt; It is also played at the private [[Holders Festival]] ground.

In golf, the [[Barbados Open]] is an annual stop on the [[European Seniors Tour]]. In December 2006 the [[WGC-World Cup]] took place at the country's [[Sandy Lane (resort)|Sandy Lane]] resort on the Country Club course, an 18-hole course designed by [[Tom Fazio]]. The Barbados Golf Club is the other main course on the island. Sanctioned by the PGA European Tour to host a PGA Seniors Tournament in 2003 and it has also hosted the Barbados Open on several occasions.

Basketball is a popular sport played at school or college and is increasing in popularity, as is volleyball, though volleyball is mainly played indoors.

Motorsports also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and currently being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar.

The presence of the trade winds along with favourable swells make the southern tip of the Island an ideal location for wave sailing (an extreme form of the sport of [[windsurfing]]).

[[Netball]] is also popular with women in Barbados.

The project stalled after the then Prime Minister of Barbados [[Lloyd Erskine Sandiford]] became ill and his party (the [[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]]) lost the next general election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamaicaobserver.com/columns/html/20030720T080000-0500_46578_OBS_CHASING_AFTER_AN_ELUSIVE_UNION.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/derumshoplime/message/18746]&lt;/ref&gt; Barbados continues to share close ties with Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana, claiming the highest number of Guyanese immigrants after the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
*Barbados had a United States military base based in the Parish of [[Saint Lucy Parish, Barbados|Saint Lucy]] at Harrisons Point, where secret projects such as [[Project HARP]] were carried out on Paragon Beach near the airport. It was said that loud explosions could be heard throughout much of the country and broke many windows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bajans.com/src.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In addition to being one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Barbados also has one of the most dense road networks in the world. Although Barbados is only about {{convert|34|km|mi|abbr=off}} at its widest point, a car journey from Six Cross Roads in St. Philip (south-east) to North Point in St. Lucy (north-central) can take one and a half hours or longer, thanks to the country's narrow, winding and rough roads.
*Barbados has half as many registered cars as citizens in the country.
*The first letter of a vehicle's licence plate designates its usage or owner's registered parish of residence. &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;ZR&quot; are for taxis; &quot;H&quot; for rental cars; &quot;B&quot; for buses and minibuses; &quot;CD&quot; for diplomatic cars; and &quot;3D&quot; or &quot;7D&quot; for defence force vehicles, while &quot;ML&quot; or &quot;MP&quot; with green plates usually designate military, police or government vehicles. As regards residence, &quot;X&quot; is for Christ Church; &quot;A&quot; for St. Andrew; &quot;G&quot; for St. George; &quot;S&quot; for St. James; &quot;J&quot; for St. John; &quot;O&quot; for St. Joseph; &quot;L&quot; for St. Lucy; &quot;M&quot; for St. Michael; &quot;E&quot; for St. Peter; &quot;P&quot; for St. Philip; and &quot;T&quot; for St. Thomas.
*Barbados and Japan have the highest per capita occurrences of [[centenarian]]s in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationnews.com/story/284159291378094.php]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Barbados is actually part of the [[South American plate]] as it was formed at the collision of both Caribbean and South American tectonic plates thus it's limestone composition.
*The drinking age in Barbados is said to be 18, although according to the ''Laws of Barbardos'' the legal age to drink alcohol is 16 and only the age to sell alcohol is 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://barbadosadvocate.com/newsitem.asp?more=letters&amp;NewsID=12456 The Barbados Advocate - What is the drinking age in Barbados?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National symbols==
===Flower===
[[File:Flower4.JPG|thumb|A yellow and red Pride of Barbados.]]
The national flower is the Pride of Barbados or ''[[Caesalpinia pulcherrima]]'' (L.) Sw., which grows across the island.

===Flag===
The trident centred within the flag is a representation of the mythological [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], god of the sea. The trident in its original unbroken form was taken from the former colonial seal, which itself was replaced by the current coat of arms. Used within the national flag, the left and right shafts of the trident were then designed as 'broken' representing the nation of Barbados breaking away from its historical and constitutional ties as a former colony.

The three points of the [[trident]] represent in Barbados the three principles of democracy—&quot;government of, for and by the people.&quot; The broken trident is set in a centred vertical band of gold representing the sands of Barbados' beaches. The gold band itself is surrounded on both sides by vertical bands of ultramarine (blue) representing the sea and sky of Barbados.

The design for the flag was created by Grantley W. Prescod and was chosen from an open competition arranged by the Barbados government. Over a thousand entries were received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barbados.gov.bb/natflag.htm |title=Government of Barbados National Flag |publisher=Barbados.gov.bb |date=12 November 2003 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golden Shield===
The Golden Shield in the coat of arms carries two &quot;[[Pride of Barbados]]&quot; flowers and the &quot;bearded&quot; fig tree (''[[Caesalpinia pulcherrima]]''), which was common on the island at the time of its settlement by the British and may have contributed to Barbados being so named.

===Coat of arms===
The [[coat of arms]] depicts two animals which are supporting the shield. On the left is a &quot;[[Dolphin fish|dolphin]]&quot; which is symbolic of the fishing industry. On the right is a [[pelican]] which is symbolic of a small island named [[Pelican Island (Barbados)|Pelican Island]] that once existed off the coast of Bridgetown. Above the shield is the helmet of Barbados with an extended arm clutching two [[sugar-cane]] stalks. The &quot;cross&quot; formation made by the cane stalks represents the saltire cross upon which [[Saint Andrew]] was crucified. On the base of the Coat of Arms reads &quot;Pride and Industy&quot;.

==National heroes==
{{Main|Barbadian national heroes}}

The act also declared that there are ten national heroes of Barbados, all of whom would be elevated to the title of &quot;The Right Excellent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbados.gov.bb/bdosnathero.htm Government of Barbados – National Heroes][http://www.barbadosparliament.com/history.php History of Barbados, The Parliament of Barbados]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bassas da India''' (also called '''Basse de Judie''') is part of the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]]. It is an uninhabited, roughly circular [[atoll]] about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, which corresponds to a total size (including [[lagoon]]) of {{convert|80|km²|0|abbr=on}}.  It is located in the southern [[Mozambique Channel]], about half-way between [[Madagascar]] (which is {{convert|385|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east) and [[Mozambique]], and {{convert|110|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Europa Island]].  It rises steeply from the [[seabed]] 3000&amp;nbsp;m below.  The reef rim averages around 100&amp;nbsp;m across and completely encloses a shallow lagoon that has a maximum depth of 15&amp;nbsp;m  Its [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) of {{convert|123700|km²|0|abbr=on}} is contiguous with that of [[Europa Island]].

The atoll consists of ten barren rocky islets, with no vegetation, totalling 0.2&amp;nbsp;km² (.077 sq mi) in area.  Those on the north and east sides are 2.1 to 3&amp;nbsp;m high, and those on the west and south sides 1.2&amp;nbsp;m  The reef is completely covered by the sea from 3 hours before to 3 hours after high tide.  The coastline of the reef measures {{convert|35.2|km|0|abbr=on}}.  The region is subject to [[cyclones]].  The atoll has long been a maritime hazard and is the site of numerous [[shipwrecks]].

About 40 and 70&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Bassas da India are [[Jaguar Seamount]] and [[Hall Tablemount]].

==History==
Bassas da India was first recorded by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers in the early sixteenth century.  It was first named '''Baixo da Judia''', &quot;Shoal of Judia&quot;. &quot;Judia&quot; was the name of a Portuguese ship that ran aground on this reef. This ship was named &quot;Judia&quot; ([[Jews|Jewess]] in Portuguese), because its owner was a Jewish trader from [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo Gomes de Brito. ''Historia Tragico-Maritima. Em que se escrevem chronologicamente os Naufragios que tiverão as Naos de Portugal, depois que se poz em exercicio a Navegação da India.'' Lisboa 1735&lt;/ref&gt; The name became '''Bassas da India''' due to transcription errors by cartographers.

It was also discovered by the ''Europa'' in 1774, hence the name &quot;the Europa Rocks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;..Europa [R]ocks, was discovered by the ship Europa in 1774.&quot; ''Africa pilot, Part 3'' Hydrographic Office of Great Britain.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The ''Malay'' was lost July 27, 1842, on Europa Rocks in Mozambique Channel&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Historical Sketch of Salem, 1626-1879&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897 it became a [[France|French]] possession, later being placed under the administration of a commissioner residing in [[Réunion]] in 1968. [[Madagascar]] continues to claim sovereignty over the islands.

==Tourism==

Diving at Bassas Da India requires a permit from the French Government.  If you dive without this permit your boat will be asked to leave or may even be confiscated.

Until the 20th century, the lands of modern day Belarus belonged to several countries, including the [[Principality of Polotsk]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the [[Russian Empire]], and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. As a result of the Russian Revolution, Belarus became a founding [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic of the Soviet Union]] and was renamed as the [[Byelorussian SSR]]. The final unification of the modern day Belarusian lands took place in 1939 when lands that were part of the [[Second Polish Republic]] were united with the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] as a result of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uni1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o85YDMTeMrUC&amp;dq=reunification+of+western+belarus&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=National purpose in the world economy: post-Soviet states in comparative perspective |accessdate=2009-11-10 |last=Abdelal|first=Rawi |year=2001 |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uni2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wGA4o-UhAfgC&amp;pg=PA713&amp;dq=reunification+of+western+belarus&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Europa World Year, Book1 |accessdate=2009-11-10 |last=Taylor &amp; Francis Group |year=2004 |publisher=[[Routledge|Europa publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uni3&quot;&gt;Клоков В.

[[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been the country's president since 1994.

Since a [[referendum]] in 1995, the country has had two official languages: [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The [[Constitution of Belarus]] does not declare an official [[religion]], although the primary religion in the country is [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox Christianity]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Belarus}}

===Etymology===
The name &quot;Belarus&quot; derives from the term &quot;[[White Ruthenia]]&quot; (White Rus'). There are several claims to where the origin of the name &quot;White Rus'&quot; came from.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaprudnik 1993 2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ethno-religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old [[Ruthenia]]n lands within the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] that was mostly populated by the early Christianized Slavs, as opposed to [[Black Ruthenia]], which to a greater extent was inhabited by predominantly pagan Balts.&lt;ref&gt;Аб паходжанні назваў Белая і Чорная Русь (Eng. &quot;About the Origins of the Names of White and Black Ruthenia&quot;), Язэп Юхо (Joseph Juho), 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible origin for the name is for the white clothing that was worn by the local Slavic population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaprudnik 1993 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Minahan|1998|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another theory suggests that the old Ruthenian lands (Polatsk, Vitsiebsk and Mahilyow) which were not conquered by the [[Tatars]] were referred to as &quot;white&quot;. Other sources claim that before 1267, the land not conquered by the Mongols was considered &quot;White Rus'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaprudnik 1993 2&quot;/&gt;

As the names &quot;Ruthenia&quot; and &quot;Rus'&quot; have very often been confused with their modern derivative &quot;Russia&quot;, White Ruthenia has often been referred to as &quot;[[White Russia]]&quot;. This misinterpretation has been supported by the Moscovite regents after the fall of Kievan Rus'. The Moskovite dukes, starting with Ivan IV, considered themselves to be the rightful successors of the Ruthenian grand duke dynasty, and their use of the name &quot;Russia&quot; as referring to all former Ruthenian (east slavic) lands became a political weapon and a [[casus belli]] for claiming the west Ruthenian territories from Lithuania and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Timothy (2004). ''The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569-1999''. Yale University Press. p.24. ISBN 978-0-300-10586-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The name first appeared in [[Medieval German literature|German]] and [[Medieval Latin literature|Latin]] [[medieval literature]]. In chronicles written by [[Jan of Czarnków]], he spoke of the Lithuanian grand duke [[Jogaila]] and his mother being imprisoned in 1381 at &quot;Albae Russiae, Poloczk dicto&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;vauchez&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vauchez|2001|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin term &quot;Alba Russia&quot; was again used by [[Pope Pius&amp;nbsp;VI]] when establishing a Jesuit Society in 1783. His official [[Papal bull]] exclaimed &quot;Approbo Societatem Jesu in Alba Russia degentem, approbo, approbo.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Courson|1879|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the country was referred to in English as &quot;White [[Ruthenia]]&quot;. The first known use of &quot;White Russia&quot; to refer to Belarus was in the late-16th century by Englishman Sir [[Jerome Horsey]], who was known for his close contacts with the Russian Royal Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;alies&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Bely | first = Alies&quot; | title = The chronicle of the White Russia: an essay on the history of one geographical name | publisher = Encyclopedix | year= 2000 | location = Minsk, Belarus | isbn = 985-6599-12-1|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, Russian [[tsar]]s used &quot;White [[Ruthenia|Rus&quot;]]&quot; when describing the lands captured from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Plokhy|2001|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belarus was formally named &quot;Belorussia&quot; ({{lang-ru|Белоруссия}}; the latter part similar, but spelled and stressed differently from Россия, &quot;Russia&quot;) in the days of the [[Russian Empire]], and the Russian tsar was usually styled &quot;Tsar of All the Russias&quot;, as &quot;Russia&quot; or the &quot;Russian Empire&quot; was formed by all the Russias&amp;nbsp;— the [[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]], and [[White Russia|White]]. At the time, &quot;Byelorussia&quot; was the only Russian language name of the country; under the Russian Empire, Belarus was generally seen as a part of the Russian nation and the Belarusian language was viewed as a dialect of Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Szporluk|2000|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917, the term White Russia caused some confusion because it was also the name of the military force that opposed the &quot;red&quot; Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richmond|1995|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of the Belorussian SSR, the term &quot;Byelorussia&quot; was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In the Polish-held Western Belarus, &quot;Byelorussia&quot; became commonly used in the regions of Białystok and Grodno during the interwar period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ioffe | first = Grigory | authorlink = | title = Understanding Belarus and How Western Foreign Policy Misses the Mark | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc | date = 2008-02-25 | location = | page = 41 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=00B6wxgftH8C&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=west+belarus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=h4faS6XHC8P48AbDxbSrAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=west%20belarus&amp;f=false | doi= | id= | isbn=0-7425-5558-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Belorussia&quot; (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called &quot;Belarus&quot; (Беларусь) in Russian and in all other language transcriptions of its name. The change was made to reflect adequately the [[Belarusian language]] form of the name. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations of that name was allowed from 1991 until 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;bynamelaw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravo.kulichki.com/zak/year1991/doc47159.htm |title=Law of the Republic of Belarus&amp;nbsp;– About the name of the Republic of Belarus |accessdate=2007-10-06 |date=1991-09-19 |publisher=Pravo&amp;nbsp;– Law of the Republic of Belarus |language=Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the [[Constitution of Belarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryder|1998|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, the name &quot;Belorussia&quot; was replaced by &quot;Belarus&quot; in English,&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaprudnik 1993 4-5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, to some extent, in Russian (although the traditional name still persists in that language as well); likewise, the adjective &quot;Belorussian&quot; or &quot;Byelorussian&quot; was replaced by &quot;Belarusian&quot; in English (though Russian has not developed a new adjective). &quot;Belarusian&quot; is closer to the original Russian term of &quot;bielaruski.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaprudnik 1993 4-5&quot;/&gt; Belarusian intelligentsia in the Stalin era attempted to change the name from &quot;Belorussia&quot; to a form of &quot;Krivia&quot; because of the supposed connection with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Treadgold|1999|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nationalists also object to the name for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belradio.fm/en/909/news/35335/ |title=Swedish government urged to change Belarus&quot; official name |accessdate=2010-02-02 |date=2009-07-13 |work=European Radio for Belarus }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;levy&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Levy|2009|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several popular newspapers published locally still retain the old name of the country in Russian in their names, for example ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda|Komsomolskaya Pravda v Byelorussii]]'', which is the localized publication of a popular Russian tabloid. Also, those who wish for Belarus to be reunited with Russia continue to use &quot;Belorussia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;levy&quot;/&gt; Officially, the full name of the country is &quot;Republic of Belarus&quot; (Рэспубліка Беларусь, Республика Беларусь, Respublika Belarus&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;bynamelaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html |title=Belarus&amp;nbsp;– Government |accessdate=2007-12-22 |date=2007-12-13 |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Audio|Republic of Belarus.ogg|listen}}

By 500 BCE, Slavs had taken up residence there, with Scythian pressure on the outskirts of their territories. Various Asiatic &quot;barbarian&quot; invasions passed around the region, including Huns and Avars c. 400-600 CE, but did not dislodge the Slavic presence.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Atlas, Ancient and Classical World, by John Haywood, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
During the negotiations of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], Belarus first declared independence on {{Nowrap|25 March}} 1918, forming the [[Belarusian People's Republic]]. The Belarusian People's Republic was created while under German occupation and it was one of the first attempts to &quot;Westernize&quot; Belarus.

Belarusian lands were then partitioned between Poland and the [[Soviet Union]] after the [[Polish–Soviet War]] ended in 1921, and the Belorussian SSR became a founding member of the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;birgerson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Marples | first = David | title = Belarus: A Denationalized Nation | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999 | page = 5 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=EMCYfOSaLSgC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Belarusian+People%27s+Republic&amp;lr=&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Belarusian%20People%27s%20Republic&amp;f=false | isbn = 90-5702-343-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Western Belarus remained part of Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;ocu1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FCBVPqAWuUsC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=occupation+of+Western+Belarus&amp;lr=&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q=occupation%20of%20Western%20Belarus&amp;f=false |title=The global and the local: understanding the dialectics of business systems |accessdate=2009-11-10 |last=Sorge |first=Arndt |year=2005 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ocu2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RSxt-JB-PDkC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=occupation+of+Western+Belarus&amp;lr=&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q=occupation%20of%20Western%20Belarus&amp;f=false |title=Miniature empires: a historical dictionary of the newly independent states |accessdate=2009-11-10 |last=Minahan |first=James |year=1998 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ocu2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FCBVPqAWuUsC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=occupation+of+Western+Belarus&amp;lr=&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q=occupation%20of%20Western%20Belarus&amp;f=false |title=Homelands: war, population and statehood in Eastern Europe and Russia, 1918–1924 |accessdate=2009-11-10 |last=Baron |first=Nick |year=2004|publisher=[[Wimbledon Publishing Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A set of agricultural reforms, culminating in the Belarusian phase of Soviet [[collectivization]], began in the 1920s. A process of rapid [[industrialization]] was undertaken during the 1930s, following the model of [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet five-year plans]].

In 1939, [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union [[Invasion of Poland|invaded and occupied Poland]], marking the beginning of [[World War II]]. Much of northeastern Poland, which had been part of the country since the [[Peace of Riga]] two decades earlier, was annexed to the [[Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], and now constitutes [[West Belarus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uni1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uni2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uni3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uni4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uni5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uni6&quot;/&gt; The Soviet-controlled Belarusian People Council officially took control of the territories, which had a predominantly ethnic Belarusian population, on October 28, 1939, in [[Białystok]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uni6&quot;/&gt;

Nazi Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in 1941{{ndash}}the [[Brest Fortress]], which had been annexed in 1939, received one of the fiercest of the war's opening blows, with its [[Defense of Brest Fortress|notable defense]] in 1941 coming to be remembered as an act of heroism in countering the German aggression. Statistically, BSSR was the hardest hit Soviet republic in the war and [[Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany|remained in Nazi hands]] until 1944. During that time, Germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic, 85% of the republic's industry, and more than one million buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;axell&quot; /&gt; Casualties were estimated to be between two and three million (about a quarter to one-third of the total population), while the [[History of the Jews in Belarus|Jewish population of Belarus]] was devastated during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and never recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;axell&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;warpop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/belarus/11.htm |title=Belarus&amp;nbsp;– Stalin and Russification |accessdate=2006-03-26 |last=Fedor |first=Helen |year=1995 |work=Belarus: A Country Study |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Belarus did not regain its pre-war level until 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;warpop&quot; /&gt;

After the war ended, Belarus was officially among the 51 founding countries of the [[United Nations Charter]] in 1945; along with [[Ukraine]] it was given an additional vote at the UN alongside that of the Soviet Union. Intense post-war reconstruction was initiated promptly. During this time, the Belorussian SSR became a major center of manufacturing in the western region of the USSR, increasing jobs and bringing an influx of ethnic [[Russians]] into the republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soviet-era&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iexplore.com/dmap/Belarus/History |title=Belarus History and Culture |accessdate=2006-03-26 |publisher=iExplore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The borders of Belorussian SSR and Poland were redrawn to a point known as the [[Curzon Line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;olson95&quot;&gt;(Olson 1994:95)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stalin]] implemented a policy of [[Sovietization]] to isolate the Belorussian SSR from [[Western world|Western influences]].&lt;ref name=&quot;warpop&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--The plan was to have any trace of Belarus's cultural identity to be replaced by those of Russia.--&gt; This policy involved sending Russians from various parts of the Soviet Union and placing them in key positions in the Belorussian SSR government. The official use of the [[Belarusian language]] and other cultural aspects were limited by [[Politics of the Soviet Union|Moscow]]. After Stalin died in 1953, successor [[Nikita Khrushchev]] continued this program, stating, &quot;The sooner we all start speaking [[Russian language|Russian]], the faster we shall build [[communism]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;warpop&quot; /&gt;

The Belorussian SSR was significantly exposed to [[nuclear fallout]] from the explosion at the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] power plant in neighboring [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorby&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/belarus/12.htm |title=Belarus- Perestroika |accessdate=2007-03-26 |last=Fedor |first=Helen |year=1995 |work=Belarus: A Country Study |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1988 at the rural site of [[Kurapaty]] near Minsk, archaeologist [[Zyanon Paznyak]], the leader of [[Conservative Christian Party of the Belarusian People's Front|Christian Conservative Party of the BPF]], discovered [[mass grave]]s of victims executed in 1937–1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorby&quot; /&gt; Some nationalists contend that this discovery is proof that the Soviet government was trying to erase the Belarusian people, causing Belarusian nationalists to seek independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;massgraves&quot;&gt;(Birgerson 2002:99)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, in March 1990, elections for seats in the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the Belorussian SSR took place.

Belarus is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], governed by a [[President of Belarus|president]] and the [[National Assembly of Belarus|National Assembly]]. The [[term of office|term]] for the president is five years, but due to a [[Belarusian referendum, 1996|1996 referendum]], [[Belarusian presidential election, 2001|the election]] that was supposed to occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001. Under the 1994 constitution, the president could only serve for two terms as president, but due to [[Belarusian referendum, 2004|a change in the constitution]], term limits were eliminated. The National Assembly is a [[bicameralism|bicameral parliament]] comprising the 110-member [[House of Representatives of Belarus|House of Representatives]] (the lower house) and the 64-member [[Council of the Republic of Belarus|Council of the Republic]] (the upper house).

The House of Representatives has the power to appoint the [[List of Belarusian Prime Ministers|prime minister]], make constitutional amendments, call for a [[Motion of Confidence|vote of confidence]] on the prime minister, and make suggestions on foreign and domestic policy. The Council of the Republic has the power to select various government officials, conduct an impeachment trial of the president, and accept or reject the bills passed by the House of Representatives. Each chamber has the ability to veto any law passed by local officials if it is contrary to the [[Constitution of Belarus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;conby&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19332.html#doc |title=Section&amp;nbsp;IV:The President, Parliament, Government, the Courts |accessdate=2007-12-22 |year=2004 |work=[[Constitution of Belarus]] |publisher=Press Service of the President of the Republic of Belarus | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071217035445/http://www.president.gov.by/en/press19332.html| archivedate = December 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1994, [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been the president of Belarus. The government includes a Council of Ministers, headed by the prime minister and five deputy prime ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.by/en/eng_sostav1.html |title=Deputy Prime Ministers of the Republic of Belarus |accessdate=2010-04-21 |year=2010 |publisher=Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus }}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of this council need not be members of the legislature and are appointed by the president. The judiciary comprises the [[Supreme Court of Belarus|Supreme Court]] and specialized courts such as the [[Constitutional Court of Belarus|Constitutional Court]], which deals with specific issues related to constitutional and business law. The judges of national courts are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic. For criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the Supreme Court. The Belarusian Constitution forbids the use of special extrajudicial courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;conby&quot; /&gt;

As of 2007, 98 of the 110 members of the House of Representatives are not affiliated with any political party and of the remaining 12 members, 8 belong to the [[Communist Party of Belarus]], 3 to the [[Agrarian Party (Belarus)|Agrarian Party of Belarus]], and 1 to the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Belarus)|Liberal Democratic Party of Belarus]].

[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-33482 Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The modern period of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century; one important writer was [[Yanka Kupala]]. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as [[Uładzimir Žyłka]], Kazimir Svayak, [[Yakub Kolas]], [[Źmitrok Biadula]] and [[Maksim Haretski]], wrote for a Belarusian language paper called ''[[Nasha Niva]]'', published in Vilnius.

In the 19th century, Polish composer [[Stanisław Moniuszko]] composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet [[Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich]] and created the opera ''Sielanka'' (''Peasant Woman''). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet ''[[Nightingale (ballet)|Nightingale]]'' by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic Bolshoi Ballet Theatre in Minsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Crystal | last=Zou | coauthors= | title=Ballets for Christmas | date=2003-12-11 | publisher= | url =http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1211/wh28-1.html | work =Shanghai Star | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-20 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dress===
The traditional Belarusian dress originates from the [[Kievan Rus']] period. Because of the cool climate, clothes, usually composed of [[flax]] or [[wool]], were designed to keep the body warm. They are decorated with ornate patterns influenced by the neighboring cultures: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations.

A typical Belarusian eats a very light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest meal of the day.

'''Belize''' ({{IPAc-en|En-us-Belize.ogg|b|ə|ˈ|l|iː|z}}; formerly ''[[British Honduras]]'') is a constitutional monarchy, and the northernmost Central American nation. Belize has a diverse society, comprising many cultures and languages. Belize is the only country in Central America where English is the official language. Belize is bordered to the north by [[Mexico]], south and west by [[Guatemala]], and to the east by the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Belize’s mainland is about 180 miles long and 68 miles wide.

With 8,867 square miles (22,960&amp;nbsp;km²) of land and a population of only 333,200 people (2010 est.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Infolink Production Center |url=http://www.statisticsbelize.org.bz |title=Statistical Institute of Belize |publisher=Statisticsbelize.org.bz |date=1 April 2007 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belize possesses the lowest population density in Central America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |title=World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision Population Database |publisher=United Nations  |date=11 March 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's population growth rate of 2.21% (2008 est.),&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; however, is the highest in the region and [[List of countries by population growth|one of the highest in the western hemisphere]]. Belize's abundance of terrestrial and marine species, and its diversity of ecosystems give it a key place within the globally significant Mesoamerican Biological Corridor.&lt;ref&gt;http://biological-diversity.info/Downloads/Ecosystem%20Mapping.zip&lt;/ref&gt;

Belize is culturally unique among its Central American neighbours; it is the only nation in the region with a [[British Empire|British colonial heritage]]. As a part of the [[Western Caribbean Zone]], however, it also shares a common heritage with the Caribbean portions of other Central American countries. In general, Belize is considered to be a Central American nation with strong ties to both the Caribbean and Latin America. Belize is a member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), and [[El Sistema de la Integración Centroamericana]] (SICA).

==Etymology==
The origin of the name Belize is unclear, but one idea is that the name is from the native Maya word ''belix'', meaning &quot;muddy water&quot;, applied to the [[Belize River]]. Others have suggested that it is derived from a Spanish pronunciation of the name of the Scottish buccaneer Peter Wallace, which was applied to an early settlement along the [[Belize River]] and to the river itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;brit1893&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1892 |title=British Honduras |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]] |volume=12 |location=New York |publisher=The Britannica Publishing Company |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uGRJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=belize+%22peter+wallace%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BunFTObcE4G0sAOzibmKDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=belize%20%22peter%20wallace%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belize has a sizeable proportion of [[Africans]] from the ancient [[Kingdom of Kongo]], who could have brought the name with them, as there is a Belize in [[Angola]] as well.

==History==
{{Main|History of Belize}}

===Early history===
[[File:Xunantunich09.jpg|thumb|&quot;El Castillo&quot; at [[Xunantunich]]]]

[[Pre-Columbian Belize|Before the arrival of Europeans]], the [[Maya civilization]] spread itself over Belize beginning around 1500 BC and flourished until about A.D. 800. The recorded history of the centre and south is dominated by [[Caracol]], where the inscriptions on their monuments were, as elsewhere, in the Lowland Maya aristocratic tongue Classic Ch'olti'an.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author={{aut|Houston, Stephen D.}} |authorlink=Stephen D. Houston |year=2000 |title=The Language of Classic Maya Inscriptions |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=321–356 |issn=0010-3204 |pmid=10768879 |last2=Robertson |first2=J |last3=Stuart |first3=D}}&lt;/ref&gt; North of the [[Maya Mountains]], the inscriptional language at [[Lamanai]] was Yucatecan as of A.D. 625.&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Closs, &lt;a href=http://www.mesoweb.com/bearc/cmr/21_text.html&gt;The Hieroglyphic Text of Stela 9, Lamanai, Belize&lt;/a&gt;, 13 from Closs, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late classic period of Maya civilization (before A.D. 1000), as many as 400,000 people may have lived in the area that is now Belize. Some lowland Maya still occupied the area when Europeans arrived in the 16th century. By then the primary inhabitants were the [[Mopan people|Mopan]] branch of the Yucatec Maya.

Spanish colonists tried to settle the inland areas of Belize, but Maya rebellions and attacks forced them to abandon these efforts.

English and Scottish buccaneers known as the [[Baymen]] first settled on the coast of Belize in 1638, seeking a sheltered region from which they could attack Spanish ships (see [[English settlement in Belize]]). The settlers turned to cutting [[logwood]] during the 18th century. The wood yielded a fixing agent for clothing dyes that was vital to the European woollen industry. The Spanish granted the British settlers the right to occupy the area and cut logwood in exchange for an end to piracy.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Bolland, Nigel. &quot;Belize: Historical Setting&quot;. In [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/bztoc.html ''A Country Study: Belize''] (Tim Merrill, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (January 1992).

===Battle of St. George's Caye===
{{Main|Battle of St. George's Caye}}

The Battle of St. George's Caye was a short military engagement that lasted from 3–10 September 1798, undertaken off the coast of what is now Belize. The name, however, is typically reserved for the final battle that occurred on 10 September. The British first appointed a superintendent over the Belize area in 1786. Prior to that time, the British government did not initially recognize the settlement in Belize as a colony for fear of provoking Spanish attack. The delay in government oversight allowed the settlers to establish their own laws and forms of government. During this time a few wealthy settlers gained control of the local legislature, known as the Public Meeting, as well as of most of the settlement's land and timber.

The battle took place between an invading force from what would become Mexico, attempting to wrest Belize for Spain, and a small force of resident woodcutters called Baymen, who fought for their livelihood assisted by black slaves.  

The Spanish repeatedly tried to gain control over Belize by force, but were unsuccessful. Spain's last effort occurred on 10 September 1798, when the British repelled the Spanish fleet in a short engagement with no known casualties on either side known as the [[Battle of St. George's Caye]]. The anniversary of the battle is now a national holiday in Belize.

===As part of the British Empire===
In the early 19th century, the British sought greater control over the settlers, threatening to suspend the Public Meeting unless it observed the government's instructions to eliminate slavery in a whole. Slavery was abolished in the [[British Empire]] in 1838, but this did little to change working conditions for labourers in the Belize settlement. [[Slave]]s of the colony were valued for their potentially superior abilities in the work of mahogany extraction. As a result, former slave owners in British Honduras earned £53.6.9 on average per slave, the highest amount paid in any British territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Melissa A. |title=The Making of Race and Place in Nineteenth-Century British Honduras |journal=Environmental History |volume=8 |number=4 |month=October |year=2003 |pages=598–617 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3985885 |issue=4 |doi=10.2307/3985885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, a series of institutions were put in place to ensure the continued presence of a viable labour force. Some of these included greatly restricting the ability of individuals to obtain land, a debt-peonage system to organise the newly &quot;free.&quot; The position of being &quot;extra special&quot; mahogany and logwood cutters undergirded the early ascriptions of the capacities (and consequently limitations) of people of African descent in the colony. Because a small elite controlled the settlement's land and commerce, former slaves had no choice but to continue to work in timber cutting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2003&quot; /&gt;

In 1836, after the emancipation of Central America from Spanish rule, the British claimed the right to administer the region. In 1862, Great Britain formally declared it a [[British Crown Colony]], subordinate to Jamaica, and named it British Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=AneYREkUJecC&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=british+legacy+miles&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EovBTLrLAoKKvQOwvLW-CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20legacy%20miles&amp;f=false Frommer's Belize] by Eliot Greenspan, page 279&lt;/ref&gt; As a colony, Belize began to attract British investors. Among the British firms that dominated the colony in the late 19th century was the Belize Estate and Produce Company, which eventually acquired half of all the privately held land in the colony. Belize Estate's influence accounts in part for the colony's reliance on the mahogany trade throughout the rest of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century.
{{wide image|British Honduras 1914.jpg|2000px|&lt;center&gt;Panoramic view of Belize City, c. 1914}}
The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s caused a near-collapse of the colonial economy as British demand for timber plummeted. The effects of widespread unemployment were worsened by a [[1931 Belize hurricane|devastating hurricane]] that struck the colony in 1931. Perceptions of the government's relief effort as inadequate were aggravated by its refusal to legalize labour unions or introduce a minimum wage. Demonstrations and riots in 1934 marked the beginning of an independence movement. In response, the government repealed criminal penalties for workers who violated the terms of their labour contracts regarding unions and granted workers the right to join unions.

Economic conditions improved during World War II (1939–1945) when many Belizean men entered the armed forces or otherwise contributed labour to the war effort. Following the war, the colony's economy again stagnated due to the pressures caused by its damaging effect. Britain's decision to devalue the British Honduras dollar in 1949 worsened economic conditions and led to the creation of the People's Committee, which demanded independence. The People's Committee's successor, the [[People's United Party]] (PUP), sought constitutional reforms that would expand voting rights to all adults.

=== Independence ===

Constitutional reforms were initiated in 1954 and resulted in a new constitution ten years later. Britain granted British Honduras self-government in 1964, and the head of the PUP—independence leader [[George Cadle Price|George Price]]—became the colony's prime minister. British Honduras was officially renamed Belize in 1973. Progress toward independence, however, was hampered by a [[Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory|Guatemalan claim to sovereignty over the territory of Belize]]. When Belize finally attained full independence on 21 September 1981, [[Guatemala]] refused to recognise the new nation. About 1,500 British troops remained to protect Belize from the Guatemalan threat.

With Price at the helm, the PUP won all elections until 1984. In that election, the first national election after independence, the PUP was defeated by the United Democratic Party ([[United Democratic Party (Belize)|UDP]]), and UDP leader [[Manuel Esquivel]] replaced Price as prime minister. Price returned to power after elections in 1989. Guatemala's president formally recognised Belize's independence in 1992. The following year the United Kingdom announced that it would end its military involvement in Belize. British soldiers were withdrawn in 1994, but the United Kingdom left behind a military training unit to assist with the newly formed Belize Defence Force.

The UDP regained power in the 1993 national election, and Esquivel became prime minister for a second time. Soon afterwards Esquivel announced the suspension of a pact reached with Guatemala during Price's tenure, claiming Price had made too many concessions in order to gain Guatemalan recognition. The pact may have curtailed the 130-year-old border dispute between the two countries. Border tensions continued into the early 2000s, although the two countries cooperated in other areas.

The PUP won a landslide victory in the 1998 national elections, and PUP leader [[Said Musa]] was sworn in as prime minister. In the 2003 elections the PUP maintained its majority, and Musa continued as prime minister. He pledged to improve conditions in the underdeveloped and largely inaccessible southern part of Belize.

In 2005, Belize was the site of [[2005 Belize unrest|unrest]] caused by discontent with the [[People's United Party]] government, including tax increases in the national budget. On 8 February 2008, Dean Barrow was sworn in as prime minister after his [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|UDP]] won a landslide victory in general elections.

Throughout Belize's history, [[Guatemala]] has claimed ownership of all or part of the territory. This claim is occasionally reflected in maps showing Belize as Guatemala's twenty-third [[Departments of Guatemala|department]]. As of March 2007, the border dispute with Guatemala remains unresolved and quite contentious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationnews.com/life/314888747749224.php |title=Nation News 2006 |publisher=Nationnews.com |date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/47/185.html |title=ACP-EU summit 2000 |publisher=Hartford-hwp.com |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guatemala's claim to Belizean territory rests, in part, on the terms Clause VII of the Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty of 1859 which (supposedly) obligated the British to build a road between Belize City and Guatemala. At various times the issue has required mediation by the United Kingdom, [[Caribbean Community]] heads of Government, the [[Organization of American States]], Mexico, and the United States. Since independence, a British garrison has been retained in Belize at the request of the Belizean government. Notably, both Guatemala and Belize are participating in confidence-building measures approved by the OAS, including the Guatemala-Belize Language Exchange Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guatemalabelize.com/ |title=Guatemala-Belize Language Exchange Project |publisher=Guatemalabelize.com |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Belize}}
[[File:Belizemap3.gif|right|thumb|Map of Belize]] 
[[File:Belize Topography.png|right|thumb|Belize Topography]]
[[File:BigRockFalls.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Big Rock Falls]] in the Cayo District]]
Belize is located on the Caribbean coast of northern Central America. It shares a border on the north with the Mexican state of [[Quintana Roo]], on the west with the Guatemalan department of [[Petén (department)|Petén]], and on the south with the Guatemalan department of [[Izabal Department|Izabal]]. To the east in the Caribbean Sea, [[Belize Barrier Reef|the second-longest barrier reef]] in the world flanks much of the {{convert|386|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}} of predominantly [[marsh]]y coastline. The area of the country totals {{convert|22960|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off|lk=off}}, an area slightly larger than [[El Salvador]] or Massachusetts. The abundance of lagoons along the coasts and in the northern interior reduces the actual land area to {{convert|21400|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off|lk=off}}.

Belize is shaped like a rectangle that extends about {{convert|280|km|mi|0|abbr=off|lk=off}} north-south and about {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=off}} east-west, with a total land boundary length of {{convert|516|km|mi|0|abbr=off|lk=off}}. The undulating courses of two rivers, the [[Rio Hondo (Belize)|Hondo]] and the [[Sarstoon River]], define much of the course of the country's northern and southern boundaries. The western border follows no natural features and runs north-south through lowland forest and highland plateau. The north of Belize consists mostly of flat, swampy coastal plains, in places heavily forested. The [[Flora and vegetation of Belize|flora]] is highly diverse considering the small geographical area. The south contains the low [[mountain range]] of the Maya Mountains. The highest point in Belize is [[Doyle's Delight]] at {{convert|1124|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiversity.bz/belize/topography/ |title=BERDS Topography |publisher=Biodiversity.bz |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caribbean coast is lined with a [[coral reef]] and some 450 [[islets]] and islands known locally as [[caye]]s (pronounced &quot;keys&quot;). They total about {{convert|690|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off|lk=off}}, and form the approximately {{convert|320|km|mi|0|abbr=off|lk=off|adj=on}} long [[Belize Barrier Reef]], the longest in the Western Hemisphere and the second longest in the world after the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. Three of merely four coral [[atoll]]s in the Western Hemisphere are located off the coast of Belize.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Belize}}
Belize has a [[tropical climate]] with pronounced [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s, although there are significant variations in weather patterns by region. Temperatures vary according to elevation, proximity to the coast, and the moderating effects of the northeast trade winds off the Caribbean. Average temperatures in the coastal regions range from {{convert|24|°C|°F|1|abbr=on|lk=off}} in January to {{convert|27|°C|°F|1|abbr=on|lk=off}} in July. Temperatures are slightly higher inland, except for the southern highland plateaus, such as the Mountain Pine Ridge, where it is noticeably cooler year round. Overall, the seasons are marked more by differences in humidity and rainfall than in temperature.

Average rainfall varies considerably, ranging from {{convert|1350|mm|in|1|abbr=on|lk=off}} in the north and west to over {{convert|4500|mm|in|1|abbr=on|lk=off}} in the extreme south. Seasonal differences in rainfall are greatest in the northern and central regions of the country where, between January and April or May, fewer than {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on|lk=off}} of rain fall per month. The dry season is shorter in the south, normally only lasting from February to April. A shorter, less rainy period, known locally as the &quot;little dry,&quot; usually occurs in late July or August, after the initial onset of the rainy season.

[[Hurricane]]s have played key—and devastating—roles in Belizean history. In 1931 an unnamed hurricane destroyed over two-thirds of the buildings in Belize City and killed more than 1,000 people. In 1955 [[Hurricane Janet]] levelled the northern town of [[Corozal Town|Corozal]]. Only six years later, [[Hurricane Hattie]] struck the central coastal area of the country, with winds in excess of {{convert|300|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on|lk=off}} and {{convert|4|m|ft|1|abbr=on|lk=off|adj=on}} storm tides. The devastation of Belize City for the second time in thirty years prompted the relocation of the capital some {{convert|80|km|mi|0}} inland to the planned city of Belmopan. [[Hurricane Greta-Olivia|Hurricane Greta]] caused more than US$25&amp;nbsp;million in damages along the southern coast in 1978. On 9 October 2001, [[Hurricane Iris]] made landfall at Monkey River Town as a {{convert|145|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} Category Four storm. The storm demolished most of the homes in the village, and destroyed the banana crop. In 2007 [[Hurricane Dean]] made landfall as a Category 5 storm only 25 miles north of the Belize/Mexico border. Dean caused extensive damage in northern Belize. 

The most recent hurricane to affect Belize directly was the Category 2 [[Hurricane Richard]], making landfall approximately 20 miles south-southeast of Belize City at around 0045 UTC on 25 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Brown/Robbie Berg|date=25 October 2010|title=Hurricane Richard Discussion Seventeen|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=25 October 2010|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2010/al19/al192010.discus.017.shtml?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The storm moved inland towards [[Belmopan]], causing estimated damage of [[Belize dollar|BZ$]]33.8&amp;nbsp;million ($17.4&amp;nbsp;million 2010&amp;nbsp;USD), primarily from damage to crops and housing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reporter.bz/index.php?mod=article&amp;cat=Headline&amp;article=4721&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetation===

While over 60% of Belize's land surface is covered by forest,&lt;ref name=&quot;servir.net&quot;&gt;Cherrington, E.A., Ek, E., Cho, P., Howell, B.F., Hernandez, B.E., Anderson, E.R., Flores, A.I., Garcia, B.C., Sempris, E., and D.E.

Belize is also a leader where it comes to protecting its biodiversity and natural resources. Recent (July 2010) information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=10030 |title=Belize protected areas 26% - not 40-odd percent |work=Amandala |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [http://www.apamo.net Association of Protected Areas Management Organizations of Belize (APAMO)] indicates that some 36% of Belize's land territory falls under some form of official protected status, giving Belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the Americas. Neighboring Costa Rica, by contrast, only has 25.8% of its land territory protected.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep-wcmc.org/wdpa/statistics/2010MDG_National_Stats.xls&lt;/ref&gt; Some 13% of Belize's territorial waters – home to the Belize Barrier Reef System – are also protected. The Belize Barrier Reef System both constitutes a UNESCO-recognized World Heritage Site and the second largest barrier reef in the world, second only to Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

====Forests and deforestation====

A [[remote sensing]] study conducted by the [http://www.cathalac.org Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC)] and [http://www.nasa.gov NASA], in collaboration with the Forest Department and the Land Information Centre (LIC) of the Government of Belize's Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment (MNRE), and published in August 2010 revealed that Belize's forest cover in early 2010 was approximately 62.7%, down from 75.9% in late 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;servir.net&quot;/&gt; A similar study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biological-diversity.info/deforestation.htm |title=Biodiversity in Belize – Deforestation |publisher=Biological-diversity.info |date=23 August 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://biological-diversity.info/deforestation.htm Belize Tropical Forest Studies] and Conservation International revealed similar trends in terms of Belize's forest cover. Both studies indicate that each year, 0.6% of Belize's forest cover is lost, translating to the clearing of an average of 24,835 acres (9,982 hectares) each year. The [http://www.usaid.gov USAID]-supported [http://www.servir.net SERVIR] study by CATHALAC, NASA, and the MNRE also showed that Belize's protected areas have been extremely effective in protecting the country's forests. While only some 6.4% of forests inside of legally declared protected areas were cleared between 1980 and 2010, over a quarter of forests outside of protected areas had been lost between 1980 and 2010. As a country with a relatively high forest cover and a low deforestation rate, Belize has significant potential for participation in initiatives such as [[REDD]]. Significantly, the [http://www.servir.net SERVIR] [http://www.servir.net/servir_bz_forest_cover_1980-2010.pdf study] on Belize's deforestation was also recognized by the [http://www.earthobservations.org intergovernmental Group on Earth Observations (GEO)], of which Belize is a member nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthobservations.org/art_010_002.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology, mineral potential, and energy===
Although a number of economically important minerals exist in Belize, none has been found in quantities large enough to warrant their mining. These minerals include [[dolomite]], [[barite]] (source of [[barium]]), [[bauxite]] (source of aluminium), [[cassiterite]] (source of tin), and gold. In 1990 [[limestone]], used in road-building, was the only mineral resource being exploited for either domestic or export use.

The similarity of Belizean geology to that of oil-producing areas of Mexico and Guatemala prompted oil companies, principally from the United States, to explore for petroleum at both offshore and on-land sites in the early 1980s. Initial results were promising, but the pace of exploration slowed later in the decade, and production operations had been halted. As a result, Belize remains almost totally dependent on imported petroleum for its energy needs. In 2006, the cultivation of newly discovered [[crude oil]] in the town of [[Spanish Lookout]], has presented new prospects and problems for this developing nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maya Homeland&quot;&gt;Burnett, John (2006).&amp;nbsp;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6248500 Maya Homeland]. ''Large Oil Field Is Found in Belize; the Angling Begins'', 4 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The country also possess considerable potential for [[hydroelectric]] and other [[renewable energy]] resources, such as [[Solar power|solar]] and [[biomass]]. In the mid-1980s, one Belizean businessman even proposed the construction of a wood-burning power station for the production of electricity, but the idea foundered in the wake of ecological concerns and economic constraints.

==Economy==
Belize has a small, essentially private enterprise economy that is based primarily on agriculture, agro-based industry, and merchandising, with tourism and construction recently assuming greater importance. In 2006, the exploitation of a newly discovered crude oil field near the town of [[Spanish Lookout]], has presented new prospects and problems for this developing nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maya Homeland&quot; /&gt; It has yet to be seen if significant economic expansion will be made by this. To date, oil production equal {{convert|3000|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}}  (2007 est.) and oil exports equal {{convert|1960|oilbbl/d|abbr=on}} (2006 est.). The country is a producer of industrial minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Oancea: Mining in Central America http://magazine.mining.com/Issues/0901/MiningCentralAmerica.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar, the chief crop, accounts for nearly half of exports, while the banana industry is the country's largest employer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maya Homeland&quot; /&gt;

The new government faces important challenges to economic stability. Rapid action to improve tax collection has been promised, but a lack of progress in reining in spending could bring the exchange rate under pressure. The tourist and construction sectors strengthened in early 1999, leading to a preliminary estimate of revived growth at 4%. Infrastructure continues to be a major challenge for the economic development of Belize.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDoS-Belize&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1955.htm|title=Background Note: Belize|publisher=Department of State, United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belize has the most expensive electricity in the region. Trade is important and the major trading partners are the United States, Mexico, the [[European Union]], and Central America.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDoS-Belize&quot; /&gt;

===Banking===
Belize has five commercial banks, of which the largest and oldest is [[Belize Bank]]. The other four banks are Heritage Bank, Atlantic Bank, [[FirstCaribbean International Bank]], and [[Scotiabank]] (Belize).

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Belize}}
A combination of natural factors—climate, the Belize Barrier Reef, over 1,000 offshore Cayes (islands), excellent fishing, safe waters for boating, [[scuba diving]], and [[snorkeling]], numerous rivers for [[rafting]], and [[kayaking]], various [[Jungle (terrain)|jungle]] and [[wildlife reserves]] of fauna and flora, for hiking, [[bird watching]], and helicopter touring, as well as many Maya ruins—support the thriving tourism and [[ecotourism]] industry. Of the hundreds of cave systems, it also has the largest cave system in Central America. Development costs are high, but the Government of Belize has designated tourism as its second development priority after agriculture. In 2007, tourist arrivals totalled 251,655 (with more than 210,000 from the U.S.) and tourist receipts amounted to $183.3&amp;nbsp;million.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Belize}}
[[Image:September 15, 2005 by Beemans.jpg|thumb|left|200px| School children in San Ignacio.]]
There are a number of kindergartens and secondary and tertiary schools in Belize. They provide quality education for students which is mostly funded by the government. Belize possess about 5 tertiary level institutions offering associates, bachelors, and undergraduate degrees. The biggest university would be the University of Belize. The university has 6 campuses country wide offering accounting, management, education, science, agriculture and other degrees.

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Belize}}
There are about 6 to 10 bus companies in Belize. These bus companies service routes from mainly the city, which is the heart of all transportation, to neighbouring villages like Ladyville and Sandhill to all other districts which are Corozal, Cayo Orange Walk, Toledo and Stann Creek. The bus prices to neighbouring villages from the city range from $1.00 BZE Dollars to $2.50 BZE Dollars. From Belize City to out districts prices range from $4.00 – $9.00 BZE Dollars.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Belize}}&lt;!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series--&gt;
Belize is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] democracy, a [[Commonwealth realm]], and therefore a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

The structure of government is based on the British parliamentary system, and the legal system is modelled on the [[Common Law]] of England. The current head of state is Elizabeth II, [[Monarchy of Belize|Queen of Belize]]. Since the Queen primarily resides in the United Kingdom, she is represented in Belize by the Governor-General. However, the cabinet, led by the [[Prime Minister of Belize]], who is [[head of government]], acting as advisors to the Governor-General, in practice exercise executive authority. Cabinet ministers are members of the majority political party in parliament and usually hold elected seats within it concurrent with their cabinet positions.

The bicameral [[National Assembly of Belize]] is composed of a [[House of Representatives of Belize|House of Representatives]] and a [[Senate of Belize|Senate]]. The 31 members of the House are popularly elected to a maximum five-year term and introduce legislation affecting the development of Belize. The Governor-General appoints the 12 members of the Senate, with a Senate president selected by the members. The Senate is responsible for debating and approving bills passed by the House.

Belize is a full participating member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Central American Integration System (SICA), The United Nations, and the Organization of American States. It is still in the process of acceding to Caricom and SICA treaties, including trade and single market treaties.

==Districts and constituencies==
[[File:Provincias de Belice.png|thumb|90px|Districts of Belize]]

Belize is divided into [[Districts of Belize|6 districts]]:
#[[Belize District]]
#[[Cayo District]]
#[[Corozal District]]
#[[Orange Walk District]]
#[[Stann Creek District]]
#[[Toledo District]]

These districts are further divided into [[Constituencies of Belize|31 constituencies]].

==Armed Forces==
{{Main|Military of Belize}}
The Belize Defence Force (BDF) is the '''Military of Belize''', and is responsible for protecting the sovereignty of Belize. The BDF, along with the Belize National Coast Guard, and the Immigration Department, is a department of the Ministry of Defence and Immigration, which is headed by [[Carlos Perdomo]]; the BDF itself is commanded by Brigadier General [[Dario Tapia]]. In 1997, the regular army numbered over 900, the reserve army 381, the air wing 45 and the maritime wing 36, amounting to an overall strength of approximately 1400.&lt;ref name=&quot;cavehill.uwi.edu&quot; /&gt; In 2005, the maritime wing became part of the Belizean Coastguard.&lt;ref name=&quot;ra_20071213&quot;&gt;&quot;Channel 5 Belize&quot;, http://www.channel5belize.com/archive_detail_story.php?story_id=15230 December 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the government spent $1.2&amp;nbsp;million on the military, constituting 1.87% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Belize&quot;, CIA World Factbook, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bh.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After Belize achieved independence in 1981 the United Kingdom maintained a deterrent force in the country to protect it from invasion by Guatemala (see [[Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory]]). The main British force left in 1994, three years after Guatemala recognised Belizean independence, but the United Kingdom maintains a training presence via the British Army Training and Support Unit Belize (BATSUB) and [[25 Flight Army Air Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cavehill.uwi.edu&quot;&gt;Dion E.

[[Colonisation]], [[slavery]], and immigration have played major roles in affecting the ethnic composition of the population and as a result, Belize is a country with [[Multiculturalism|numerous cultures]], [[Multilingualism|languages]], and [[ethnic group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Volz, Joe and Coy, Cissie, [http://www.aarp.org/travel/destinations/americas/belize_mayan_past.html &quot;Belize: Central American Jewel,&quot;] on [http://www.aarp.org aarp.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Vicki (2007), [http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070218/news_lz1t18belize.html &quot;Belize beckons with unspoiled Caribbean isles, friendly faces, rich marine life,&quot;] ''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', 18 February 2007, at [http://www.signonsandiego.com/ SignOnSanDiego.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Link, Matthew R.

===Population and Housing===
According to the 2010 Housing and Population Census, the total population of Belize is 312,971. The total number of households in Belize was 79,598 and the average household size was 3.9. 
The homeless population was amounted to 118 total of which 113 were males and 5 were females. The institutional population were discovered to be 1,957; 1,665 being male and 292 being females.
The total population in urban Belize was 139,069; 68,020 males and 71,049 females. 39,104 total households in 2010 and a 3.6 average household size. 
The total population in rural Belize was 171,827; 88,261 males and 83,566 females. 40,494 total households in 2010 and a 4.2 average household size.

===Maya and early settlers===
The Maya are thought to have been in Belize and the [[Yucatán]] region since the second millennium BC; however, much of Belize's original Maya population was wiped out by disease and conflicts between [[tribe]]s and with Europeans. Three Maya groups now inhabit the country: The [[Yucatec]] (who came from Yucatán, Mexico to escape the Caste War of the 1840s), the [[Mopan people|Mopan]] (indigenous to Belize but were forced out by the British; they returned from Guatemala to evade slavery in the 19th century), and [[Q'eqchi' people|Kekchi]] (also fled from slavery in Guatemala in the 19th century).&lt;ref&gt;Cho, Julian (1998).&amp;nbsp;[http://geography.berkeley.edu/projectsresources/MayanAtlas/MayaAtlas/mayahome.htm Maya Homeland]. University of California Berkeley Geography Department and the Toledo Maya of Southern Belize. Retrieved 4 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The later groups are chiefly found in the Toledo District.

White, initially Spanish [[conquistadors]] explored and declared the land a [[Spanish colony]] but chose not to settle due to the lack of resources such as gold and the strong defence of the Yucatán by the Maya. Later English and Scottish settlers and pirates known as the &quot;Baymen&quot; entered the area in the 16th and 17th century respectively and established a logwood trade colony in what would become the Belize District.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2003&quot;/&gt;

===Kriols===
{{Main|Belizean Kriol people}}
Kriols make up roughly 25% of the Belizean population and about 75% percent of the [[Belizean American|Diaspora]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson 2003 pp. 598&quot;&gt;(Johnson,Melissa A.)''The Making of Race and Place in Nineteenth-Century British Honduras''. Environmental History, Vol. 8, No. 4 (Oct. 2003), pp. 598–617, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3985885]&lt;/ref&gt; They are descendants of the Baymen slave owners, and [[slavery|slaves]] brought to Belize for the purpose of the logging industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belizenet.com/bzeguat/intro.html |title=Belize-Guatemala Territorial Issue – Chapter 1 |publisher=Belizenet.com |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These slaves were mostly Black (many also of [[Miskito people|Miskito]] ancestry) from [[Nicaragua]] and born Africans who had spent very brief periods in Jamaica.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3985885 (Johnson,Melissa A.) ''The Making of Race and Place in Nineteenth-Century British Honduras''. Environmental History, Vol. 8, No. 4 (Oct. 2003), pp. 598–617, ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caracoles|Bay Island]]ers and more Jamaicans came in the late-19th century, further adding these all ready varied peoples, creating this ethnic group.

For all intents and purposes, Kriol is an ethnic and linguistic denomination, but some natives, even those blonde and blue-eyed, may call themselves Kriol, defining it as more a cultural attribute and not limited to physical appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;/&gt; [[Belizean Kriol language|Kriol]] was historically only spoken by them, but this ethnicity has become synonymous with the '''Belizean''' national identity, and as a result it is now spoken by about 75% of Belizeans.&lt;ref name=&quot;2000 Belize Census&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://celade.cepal.org/cgibin/RpWebEngine.exe/PortalAction?&amp;MODE=MAIN&amp;BASE=CPVBLZ2000&amp;MAIN=WebServerMain.inl

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson 2003 pp. 598&quot;/&gt; Kriols are found all over Belize, but predominantly in urban areas such as Belize City, coastal towns and villages, and in the Belize River Valley.

===Garinagu===
{{Main|Garifuna people}}
The Garinagu (singular ''Garifuna'') are a mix of African, [[Arawaks|Arawak]], and [[Carib people|Carib]] ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2003&quot;/&gt; More precisely, the average Garifuna is 76% Sub Saharan African, 20% Arawak/Carib and 4% European.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, M.H. 1997 Biocultural adaptation to disease in the Caribbean: Case study of a migrant population. Journal of Caribbean Studies. Health and Disease in the Caribbean. 12(1): 141–155. on [http://www2.ku.edu/~lba/MHCbcar.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history they have been incorrectly labeled as ''Black Caribs''. When the British took over [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, they were opposed by French settlers and their Carib allies. The Caribs eventually surrendered to the British in 1796. The British separated the more African-looking Caribs from the more indigenous looking ones. 5,000 Garinagu were exiled, but only about 2,500 of them survived the voyage to [[Roatán]], an island off the coast of [[Honduras]].

Because [[Roatán]] was too small and infertile to support their population, the Garinagu petitioned the Spanish authorities of Honduras to be allowed to settle on the mainland coast. The Spanish employed them as soldiers, and they spread along the Caribbean coast of Central America. The Garinagu settled in Seine Bight, [[Punta Gorda, Belize|Punta Gorda]] and Punta Negra, Belize by way of Honduras as early as 1802. However, in Belize 19 November 1832 is the date officially recognized as &quot;Garifuna Settlement Day&quot; in Dangriga.&lt;ref name=&quot;2000 Belize Census&quot; /&gt;

===Mestizos and Spanish===
Around the 1840s, [[Mestizo]], Spanish, and [[Yucatec]] settlers from Mexico began to settle in the north due to the [[Caste War of Yucatán]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mybelizeadventure.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Mestizo location in Belize; Location | url =http://www.mybelizeadventure.com/about_belize/people.php | accessdate =14 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Northern Belize Caste War History; Location | url =http://www.northernbelize.com/hist_caste.html| accessdate =14 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the Mestizos are the largest ethnic group in Belize, making up 34% of the population in 2000, and Spanish make up 15%. They predominate in the Corozal, Orange Walk, and much of the Cayo district, as well as San Pedro town in Ambergris Caye.&lt;ref name=&quot;2000 Belize Census&quot; /&gt;

The Mestizo culture was originated from a mixture of Spanish and Maya. The Mestizo towns of Belize have much more in common with neighbouring [[Yucatán]] and most of Guatemala and Central America than central, southern or coastal Belize. Towns centre on a main square, and social life focuses on the Catholic Church built on one side of it. Most Mestizos and Spanish speak Spanish, English and Kriol fluently.&lt;ref name=&quot;mybelizeadventure.com&quot; /&gt;

===Other groups===
[[Image:Menonite Children.JPG|thumb|Mennonite children selling peanuts near Lamanai in Belize. Roughly 10,000 German-speaking [[Mennonites in Belize|Mennonites]] live in Belize, farming the land and living according to their religious beliefs.]]
The remaining 9% is a mix of Mennonite farmers, [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], whites from the United States and Canada, and many other foreign groups brought to assist the country's development. During the 1860s, a large influx of Indians and American Civil War veterans from [[Louisiana]] and other Southern states established [[Confederate settlements in British Honduras]] and introduced commercial sugar cane production to the colony, establishing 11 settlements in the interior. The 20th century saw the arrival of [[Asian people|Asian]] settlers from mainland China, South Korea, India, [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]]. [[Central American]] immigrants and expatriate Americans and Africans also began to settle in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;2000 Belize Census&quot; /&gt;

===Emigration, immigration, and demographic shifts===
Kriols and other ethnic groups are emigrating mostly to the United States, but also to the United Kingdom and other developed nations for better opportunities. Based on the latest [[U.S. Census]], the number of Belizeans in the United States is approximately 160,000 (including 70,000 legal residents and naturalised citizens), consisting mainly of Kriols and Garinagu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov &quot;Diaspora of Belize&quot;] Council on Diplomacy, Washington, D.C. and Consulate General of Belize.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to conflicts in neighbouring Central American nations, Mestizo [[refugee]]s from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have fled to Belize in significant numbers during the 1980s, and have been significantly adding to this group.&lt;ref name=&quot;paulglassman.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Mestizo location in Belize; Location | url =http://www.paulglassman.com/bg4.htm | accessdate =14 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These two events have been changing the demographics of the nation for the last 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;paulglassman.com&quot; /&gt;

According to [[The World Factbook|estimates by the CIA]] in 2009, Belize's [[total fertility rate]] currently stands at approximately 3.6 children per woman. Its birth rate is 27.33 births/1,000 population, and the death rate is 5.8 deaths/1,000 population.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

===Language===
{{Main|Languages of Belize}}
English is the only official language of Belize due to being a former British colony. It is the main language used in government and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562789_2/Belize.html#s3 |title=Belize: Language and Religion |accessdate=9 September 2008 |publisher=MSN Encarta Encyclopedia |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwPxvQRn|archivedate=31 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although only 5.6% of the population speaks it as the main language at home, 54% can speak it very well, and another 26% can speak some English.

*Spanish is the second most extensivley spoken language in Belize. It is commonly spoken at home by 50% of the population and spoken as a second language by many Belizeans.

*[[Belizean Creole|Kriol]] is the most extended language when mother tongue and second/third language speakers are included. 37% of Belizeans consider their primary language to be Kriol, an [[English-based creole languages|English Creole]] of words and syntax from various [[African languages]] (namely [[Akan language|Akan]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], and [[Twi language|Twi]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kriol.org.bz/&lt;/ref&gt; and other languages ([[Miskito language|Miskito]], [[Central American Spanish]]). It is also a second or third language for another 40% of the multilingual country.&lt;ref name=&quot;2000 Belize Census&quot; /&gt; Kriol shares similarities with many Caribbean English Creoles as far as phonology and pronunciations are concerned. Also, many of its words and structures are both lexically and phonologically similar to English, its superstrate language. Due to the fact that it is English-based, all Kriol speakers can understand English. A number of linguists classify Belizean Kriol as a separate language, while others consider it to be a [[dialect]] of English.

*Maya languages such as [[Kekchi language|Kekchi]], [[Mopan language|Mopan]] and [[Yucatec language|Yucatec]] are spoken by less than 5% of the population,&lt;ref name=&quot;2000 Belize Census&quot; /&gt; which is also the case with Garifuna (being [[Arawakan]]/[[Maipurean]]-based and with elements of the Carib language, French, English, and Spanish)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cab/Belize.html#s3 |title=Belize: Language and Religion |accessdate=9 September 2008 |work=Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. &quot;Garifuna&quot;. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Retrieved on 14 March 2007.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Plautdietsch]] dialect of the Mennonites. Literacy currently stands at nearly 80%. In 2001, [[UNESCO]] declared the Garifuna language, dance, and music a &quot;[[Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]&quot;.

English is the primary language of public education, with Spanish taught in primary and secondary school as well. Bilingualism is very common.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Belize}}
Religious freedom is guaranteed in Belize. Nearly 80% of the inhabitants are Christian, with 49.6% of Belizeans being Roman Catholics and 29% Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108514.htm]&quot;, International Religious Freedom Report 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Catholics frequently visit the country for special gospel revivals. The [[Greek Orthodox Church]] has a presence in [[Santa Elena, Belize|Santa Elena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxchurch.bz/ |title=Orthodox Church of Belize homepage |publisher=Orthodoxchurch.bz |date=22 August 1982 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehovah's Witness]]es have experienced a significant increase in membership in recent years. According to the Witnesses, around 3% of the population attended at least one religious meeting in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.watchtower.org/e/statistics/worldwide_report.htm 2007 Report of Jehovah's Witnesses Worldwide]&quot;, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] claims 3,300 members in the country&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/belize Belize].

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Belize}}
Belizean cuisine is inspired by British, Mexican and Western Caribbean cooking. The basic ingredients are rice and beans, which are often eaten with chicken, pork, veal, fish or vegetables. Coconut milk and fried [[plantain]]s are added to the dishes to create a truly tropical taste. Exotic ingredients include armadillo meat, venison and fried paca (called Gibnut in Kriol). Conch soup is a traditional dish which has a characteristic taste and thick consistency due to added okra, potatoes, yams, cassava flour and a touch of toasted habanero. Immigration has brought Garifuna dishes based on fish and plantains, and among the best known are Hudut, Darasa, Ereba, Bundiga, and so on. Belizean food is almost always accompanied by white rice in coconut milk.

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport in Belize}}
The major sports in Belize are [[Association football|football]], basketball, volleyball and cycling, with smaller followings of [[boat racing]], [[track &amp; field]], [[softball]] and [[cricket]]. Fishing is also popular in areas of Belize. The [[Cross Country Cycling Classic]], also known as the &quot;cross country&quot; race or the Holy Saturday Cross Country Cycling Classic, is considered to be one of the most important Belize sports events. This one-day sports event is meant for amateur cyclists but has also gained a worldwide popularity.

This cycling event in Belize has seven rider categories based on rider rating, age, and gender. Action-packed and thrilling, this most interesting sporting event allows for the participation of tourists and visitors alike from all over the world. The cycling routes offer enchanting and mesmerizing views across the resplendent greenery of the forest areas and the meandering rivers. This makes the event even more popular among the tourists.

The history of Cross Country Cycling Classic in Belize dates back to the period when [[Monrad Metzgen]] picked up the idea from a small village on the Northern highway. The people from this village used to cover long distances on their bicycles to attend the weekly game of cricket. He improvised on this observation and added thrill by sowing the idea of a sporting event in the difficult terrain of western highways, which were then poorly built.

On Easter day, citizens of Dangriga participate in a yearly fishing tournament. First, second, and third prize are awarded based on a scoring combination of size, species, and number. The tournament is broadcast over local radio stations, and prize money is awarded to the winners.

Belize's National Basketball Team is the only National Team that has achieved major victories internationally. During the 1998 Caricom Men's Basketball Championship, held at the Civic Center in Belize City. Belize went on to win the championship and proceeded to participate in the 1999 Centrobasquet Tournament in Havana. The National Team finished seventh of eight teams after winning only 1 game despite playing close all the way. In a return engagement at the 2000 CARICOM championship in Barbados, Belize placed fourth. Shortly thereafter, Belize moved to the Central American region and won the Central American Games championship in 2001. The team has failed to duplicate this success, most recently finishing with a 2 and 4 record in the 2006 COCABA championship. The team finished second in the 2009 COCABA tournament in Cancun, Mexico where it went 3–0 in group play. Belize won its opening match in the Centrobasquet Tournament, 2010, defeating Trinidad and Tobago, but lost badly to Mexico in a rematch of the COCABA final. A tough win over Cuba set Belize in position to advance, but they fell to Puerto Rico in their final match and failed to qualify.

==National Symbols==
===Black Orchid===
[[File:EncycliaCochleata.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Prosthechea cochleata|black orchid]]]]
{{See|Prosthechea cochleata}}
The National Flower of Belize is the Black Orchid (''[[Prosthechea cochleata]]''), also known as ''Encyclia cochleata'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://belizeconsulatela.org/nationalsymbols.html &quot;National Symbols of Belize&quot;] Council on Diplomacy, Washington, D.C. and Consulate General of Belize. Retrieved 5 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahogany Tree===
The National Tree of Belize is the Mahogany Tree (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]''), one of the magnificent giants of the Belize rain forest. Rising straight and tall to over a hundred feet from great buttresses at the roots, it emerges above the canopy of the surrounding trees with a crown of large, shining green leaves. In the early months of the year, when the leaves fall and new red-brown growth appears, the tree can be spotted from a great distance. The tree puts out a great flush of small whitish flowers – the blossom for dark fruits, which are pear-shaped capsules about six inches long. When the fruits mature they split into five valves, freeing large winged seeds which are carried away by the wind. They fall on the shaded protection of the forest floor and germinate to begin a new life cycle. The mahogany tree matures in 60 to 80 years.

British settlers exploited the Belizean forest for mahogany, beginning around the middle of the 17th century. It was originally exported to the United Kingdom in the form of squared logs, but shipments now consist mainly of sawn lumber.
The motto &quot;Sub Umbra Florero&quot; means: Under the shade (of the mahogany tree) I flourish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://belizeconsulatela.org/nationalsymbols.html &quot;National Symbols of Belize&quot;] Council on Diplomacy, Washington, D.C. and Consulate General of Belize.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keel Billed Toucan===
[[File:Ramphastos sulfuratus -Belize Zoo-6a-2c.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Ramphastos sulfuratus|Keel Billed Toucan]]]]
The Keel Billed Toucan (''[[Ramphastos sulfuratus]]'') is the National Bird of Belize. It is noted for its great, canoe-shaped bill and its brightly coloured green, blue, red and orange feathers. Toucans are found in open areas of the country with large trees. It is mostly black with bright yellow cheeks and chest, red under the tail and a distinctive white patch at the base of the tail.They make a monotonous frog-like croak. Toucans like fruits, and eat by cutting with the serrated edge of their bills. Toucans nest in holes in trees, using natural holes or holes made by woodpeckers, often enlarging the cavity by removing soft, rotten wood. They lay two to four eggs which are incubated by both parents. The nesting stage lasts from six to seven weeks.

===Tapir===
Belize's National Animal is the [[Baird's Tapir]], the largest land mammal of the American tropics. It is also known as the mountain cow, although it is actually related to the horse and the rhinoceros. It is protected under Belizean law.

==National heroes==
The three people who have received Belize's highest honours, [[Order of the National Hero (Belize)|Order of National Hero and Order of Belize]], are:
*[[Phillip Goldson]]
*[[Monrad Metzgen]]
*[[George Cadle Price]]

'''Benin''' ({{IPAc-en|En-us-Benin.ogg|b|ɨ|ˈ|n|iː|n}}), officially the '''Republic of Benin''', is a country in [[West Africa]]. It borders [[Togo]] to the west, [[Nigeria]] to the east and [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Niger]] to the north. Its small southern coastline on the [[Bight of Benin]] is where a majority of the population is located. The capital of Benin is [[Porto-Novo]], but the [[seat of government]] is located in the country's largest city of [[Cotonou]]. Benin covers an area of approximately 110,000 square kilometers (42,000 sq mi), with a population of approximately 9.05 million. Benin is a [[tropical]], [[sub-Saharan]] nation, highly dependent on [[agriculture]], with substantial employment and income arising from [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/isfp/country-information/benin/en/ &quot;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&quot;]. United Nations, June 29th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The official language of Benin is [[French people|French]], however, indigenous languages such as [[Fon language|Fon]] and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] are commonly spoken. The largest religious group in Benin is [[Roman Catholicism]], followed closely by [[Muslims]], [[Vodun]], and [[Protestants]]. Benin is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]], the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]], [[South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone]], [[La Francophonie]], the [[Community of Sahel-Saharan States]], the [[African Petroleum Producers Association]] and the [[Niger Basin Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Benin-INTERNATIONAL-COOPERATION.html &quot;Benin - International Cooperation&quot;]. Nation Encyclopedia, June 29th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 17th century to the 19th century, the land of current-day Benin was ruled by the [[Dahomey|Kingdom of Dahomey]]. The region became known as the [[Slave Coast]] during the early 17th century due to the prevalence of the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]]. In 1892, with the slave trade banned and regional power diminishing, [[France]] took over the area and renamed it [[French Dahomey]]. In 1960, Dahomey gained full independence from France, bringing in a democratic government for the next 12 years.

Between 1972 and 1990, a self-proclaimed [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[dictatorship]] called the [[People's Republic of Benin]] existed, ushering in a period of repression which ultimately led to an economic collapse. Formation of the Republic of Benin occurred in 1991, bringing in multiparty elections.

==Name==
During the colonial period and at independence, the country was [[Geographical renaming|known as]] '''Dahomey'''. It was renamed on November 30, 1975, to '''Benin''' after the body of water on which the country lies - the [[Bight of Benin]] - which, in turn, had been named after the [[Benin Empire]]. The country of Benin has no direct connection to [[Benin City]] in modern Nigeria, nor to the [[Benin bronzes]].

The new name, Benin, was chosen for its neutrality. Dahomey was the name of the former [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], which covered only the southern third of the present country and therefore did not represent the northwestern sector [[Atakora]] nor the kingdom of [[Borgu]], which covered the northeastern third.

The Kingdom of Dahomey formed from a mixture of ethnic groups on the [[Abomey]] plain. Historians theorize that the insecurity caused by slave trading may have contributed to mass migrations of groups to modern day Abomey, including some [[Aja people|Aja]], a [[Gbe languages|Gbe]] people who are believed to have founded the city. Those Aja living in Abomey mingled with the local [[Fon people]], also a Gbe people, creating a new ethnic group known as &quot;Dahomey&quot;.

The Gbe peoples are said to be descendents of a number of migrants from Wyo. [[Gangnihessou]]  (a member of an Aja dynasty that in the 16th century along with the Aja populace had come from [[Tado]] before settling and ruling separately in what is now [[Abomey]], [[Allada]], and [[Porto Novo]])  became the first ruler of the Dahomey Kingdom. Dahomey had a military culture aimed at securing and eventually expanding the borders of the small kingdom with its capital at modern day Abomey.

The [[Dahomey|Dahomey Kingdom]] was known for its culture and traditions. Young boys were often apprenticed to older soldiers, and taught the kingdom's military customs until they were old enough to join the navy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Dahomey was also famous for instituting an elite female soldier corps, called [[Ahosi]] or &quot;our mothers&quot; in the [[Fongbe]] language, and known by many Europeans as the Dahomean [[Amazons]]. This emphasis on military preparation and achievement earned Dahomey the nickname of &quot;black [[Sparta]]&quot; from European observers and 19th century explorers like [[Sir Richard Burton]].

The kings of [[Dahomey]] sold their war captives into transatlantic slavery;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,91575,00.html African Ambassador Apologizes for Slavery Role]. FOXNews.com. July 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise the captives would have been killed in a ceremony known as the [[The annual customs of Dahomey|Annual Customs]]. By c.1750, the King of Dahomey was earning an estimated £250,000 per year by selling Africans to the European slave-traders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/9chapter2.shtml African Slave Owners]. the story of South Africa | BBC World Service.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the leaders of Dahomey appeared initially to resist the slave trade, it flourished in the region of Dahomey for almost three hundred years (beginning in 1472 with a trade agreement with [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] merchants), leading to the area being named &quot;the Slave Coast&quot;. Court protocols, which demanded that a portion of war captives from the kingdom's many battles be decapitated, decreased the number of enslaved people exported from the area. The number went from 20,000 per year at the beginning of the seventeenth century to 12,000 at the beginning of the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The decline was partly due to the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|banning]]{{Citation needed|reason=when|date=May 2010}} of the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]] by Britain and other countries. This decline continued until 1885, when the last Portuguese slave ship departed from the coast of the present-day Benin Republic.

By the middle of the nineteenth century, Dahomey started to lose its status as the regional power. This enabled the French to take over the area in 1892. In 1899, the French included the land called [[French Dahomey]] within the [[French West Africa]] colony. In 1958, France granted autonomy to the [[Republic of Dahomey]], and full independence as of August 1, 1960. The president who led them to independence was Hubert Maga.

For the next twelve years, ethnic strife contributed to a period of turbulence. There were several coups and regime changes, with four figures dominating — [[Hubert Maga]], [[Sourou Migan Apithy|Sourou Apithy]], [[Justin Ahomadegbé]] and [[Emile Derlin Zinsou]] — the first three representing a different area and ethnicity of the country. These three agreed to form a [[presidential council]] after violence marred the 1970 elections.

On May 7, 1972, Maga turned over power to Ahomadegbe. On October 26, 1972, Lt. Col. [[Mathieu Kérékou]] overthrew the ruling triumvirate, becoming president  and stating that the country will not &quot;burden itself by copying foreign [[ideology]], and wants neither Capitalism, Communism, nor Socialism&quot;. On November 30, however, he announced that the country was officially  [[Marxism|Marxist]], under the control of the Military Council of the Revolution (CNR{{Citation needed|reason=abr?|date=May 2010}}), which nationalized the petroleum industry and banks. On November 30, 1975, he renamed the country to '''[[People's Republic of Benin]]'''.

In 1979, the [[CNR]] was dissolved, and Kérékou arranged [[show election]]s where he was the only allowed candidate. Establishing relations with the [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], and [[Libya]], he put nearly all businesses and economic activities under state control, causing foreign investment in Benin to dry up.&lt;ref name=&quot;kneib&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Benin|author=Martha Kneib|pages=22–25|isbn=0761423281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kérékou attempted to reorganize education, pushing his own aphorisms such as &quot;Poverty is not a fatality&quot;, resulting in a mass [[emigration|exodus]] of teachers, along with a large number of other professionals.&lt;ref name=&quot;kneib&quot;/&gt; The regime financed itself by contracting to take nuclear waste from France.&lt;ref name=&quot;kneib&quot;/&gt;

In 1980, Kérékou converted to [[Islam]] and changed his first name to Ahmed, then changed his name back after claiming to be a [[born-again Christian]].

In 1989, riots broke out after the regime did not have money to pay its army. The banking system collapsed. Eventually Kérékou renounced [[Marxism]] and a convention forced Kérékou to release political prisoners and arrange elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;kneib&quot;/&gt;

The name of the country was changed to the '''Republic of Benin''' on March 1, 1990, once the newly formed country's [[constitution]] was complete, after the abolition of [[Marxism–Leninism]] in the nation in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/bj.html |title=Benin |publisher=Flagspot.net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.socialist.net/history-people-s-republic-of-benin.htm |title=A short history of the People's Republic of Benin (1974–1990) |publisher=Socialist.net |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Kérékou was defeated by [[Nicéphore Soglo]], and became the first black African president to step down after an election. Kérékou returned to power after winning the 1996 vote. In 2001, a closely fought election resulted in Kérékou winning another term, after which his opponents claimed election irregularities.

Kérékou and former president Soglo did not run in the 2006 elections, as both were barred by the constitution's restrictions on age and total terms of candidates. Kérékou is widely praised{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} for making no effort to change the constitution so that he could remain in office or run again, unlike many African leaders.

On March 5, 2006, an election was held that was considered free and fair. It resulted in a [[Two-round system|runoff]] between [[Yayi Boni]] and [[Adrien Houngbédji]]. The runoff election was held on March 19, and was won by Boni, who assumed office on April 6. The success of the fair multi-party elections in Benin won praise internationally. Benin is considered by a few to be a model democracy in Africa, but with such a short track record that only time will tell.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Benin}}&lt;!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series--&gt;
Benin's politics take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], where the [[President of Benin]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], within a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the legislature. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. The political system is derived from the 1990 [[Constitution of Benin]] and the subsequent transition to [[democracy]] in 1991.

In its 2007 Worldwide Press Freedom Index, [[Reporters Without Borders]] ranked Benin 53rd out of 169 countries.

Benin scored highly in the 2009 [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]], which comprehensively measures the state of governance across the continent. Benin was ranked 15th out of 53 [[Africa]]n countries, and scored particularly well in the categories of Safety &amp; Security and Participation &amp; Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en/pressrelease/media-centre/press-releases/benin-ranks-15th-out-of-53-african-countries-in-latest-assessment-of-african-governance.html Benin ranks 15th out of 53 African countries in latest assessment of African Governance] Media release at [[Mo Ibrahim Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Benin has been rated equal-88th out of 159 countries in a 2005 analysis of police, business and political corruption. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/gov_cor-government-corruption Corruption by country] at [[NationMaster]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Benin map.png|thumb|left|Map of Benin]]
{{Main|Geography of Benin|Climate of Benin}}
[[File:Atakora Benin Batia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Atakora]].]]
Benin, a narrow, north-south strip of land in west Africa, lies between the [[Equator]] and the [[Tropic of Cancer]]. Benin lies between latitudes [[6th parallel north|6°]] and [[13th parallel north|13°N]], and longitudes [[prime meridian|0°]] and [[4th meridian east|4°E]]. Benin is bounded by Togo to the west, [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Niger]] to the north, [[Nigeria]] to the east, and the [[Bight of Benin]] to the south.

With an area of {{convert|112622|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, Benin extends from the [[Niger River]] in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the south, a distance of {{convert|650|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Although the coastline measures {{convert|121|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} the country measures about {{convert|325|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} at its widest point.

It is one of the smaller countries in West Africa, one-eighth the size of [[Nigeria]], its neighbor to the east. It is, however, twice as large as [[Togo]], its neighbor to the west.

Benin shows little variation in elevation and can be divided into four areas from the south to the north, starting with the low-lying, sandy, coastal plain (highest elevation {{convert|10|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}) which is, at most, {{convert|10|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} wide. It is marshy and dotted with lakes and lagoons communicating with the ocean. Behind the coast lies the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] covered plateaus of southern Benin (altitude between {{convert|20|and|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}) are split by valleys running north to south along the [[Couffo River|Couffo]], [[Zou River|Zou]], and [[Oueme River]]s.

Then an area of flat lands dotted with rocky hills whose altitude seldom reaches {{convert|400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} extends around Nikki and Save. Finally, a range of mountains extends along the northwest border and into Togo; this is the Atacora, with the highest point, [[Mont Sokbaro]], at {{convert|658|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

Benin has fields of lying fallow, mangroves, and remnants of large sacred forests. In the rest of the country, the savanna is covered with thorny scrubs and dotted with huge [[baobab]] trees. Some forests line the banks of rivers. In the north and the northwest of Benin the [[W National Park|Reserve du W du Niger]] and [[Pendjari National Park]] attract tourists eager to see elephants, lions, antelopes, hippos, and monkeys.&lt;ref name=bn&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6761.htm &quot;Background Note: Benin&quot;]. U.S. Department of State (June 2008). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically Benin has served as habitat for the [[endangered]] [[Painted Hunting Dog]], ''[[Lycaon pictus]]'';&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=35993 ''Painted Hunting Dog: Lycaon pictus'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg]&lt;/ref&gt; however, this canid is thought to have been locally extirpated.

Benin's climate is hot and humid. Annual rainfall in the coastal area averages 1300 mm or about 51 inches. Benin has two rainy and two dry seasons per year. The principal rainy season is from April to late July, with a shorter less intense rainy period from late September to November. The main dry season is from December to April, with a short cooler dry season from late July to early September. Temperatures and humidity are high along the tropical coast. In [[Cotonou]], the average maximum temperature is {{convert|31|°C|1}}; the minimum is {{convert|24|°C|1}}.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

Variations in temperature increase when moving north through a [[savanna]] and plateau toward the Sahel. A dry wind from the Sahara called the [[Harmattan]] blows from December to March, during which grass dries up, the vegetation turns reddish brown, and a veil of fine dust hangs over the country, causing the skies to be overcast. It also is the season when farmers burn brush in the fields.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Benin}}
[[File:Gossypium sp MS4007.JPG|thumb|280 px|right|Cotton field in northern Benin]]
The economy of Benin is dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Cotton accounts for 40% of GDP and roughly 80% of official export receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6761.htm |title=Background Note: Benin |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth in real output has averaged around 5% in the past seven years, but rapid population growth has offset much of this increase. Inflation has subsided over the past several years. Benin uses the [[CFA franc]], which is pegged to the euro.

Benin’s economy has continued to strengthen over the past years, with real GDP growth estimated at 5.1 percent and 5.7 percent in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The main driver of growth is the agricultural sector, with cotton being the country’s main export, while services continue to contribute the largest part of GDP largely because of Benin’s geographical location, enabling trade, transportation, transit and tourism activities with its neighbouring states. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/benin/benin-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A: Benin Financial Sector profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to raise growth still further, Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis on tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and communication technology. Projects to improve the business climate by reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice system, and the financial sector were included in Benin's [[US$]]307 million [[Millennium Challenge Account]] grant signed in February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcc.gov/mcc/countries/benin/index.shtm Benin] at Millennium Challenge Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt situation, with Benin benefiting from a G8 debt reduction announced in July 2005, while pressing for more rapid structural reforms. An insufficient electrical supply continues to adversely affect Benin's economic growth though the government recently has taken steps to increase domestic power production.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{Cite web|author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Benin |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bn.html |year=2009|accessdate=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[trade unions in Benin]] represent up to 75% of the formal workforce, the large informal economy has been noted by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITCU) to contain ongoing problems, including a lack of women's wage equality, the use of [[child labour]], and the continuing issue of [[unfree labour|forced labour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Cotonou harbors the country's only seaport and international airport. A new port is currently under construction between Cotonou and Porto Novo. Benin is connected by 2 lane asphalted roads to its neighboring countries (Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria). Mobile telephone service is available across the country through various [[Mobile Network Code|operators]]. ADSL connections are available in some areas. Benin is connected to the Internet by way of satellite connections (since 1998) and a single submarine cable [[SAT-3/WASC (cable system)|SAT-3/WASC]] (since 2001), keeping the price of data extremely high. Relief is expected with initiation of the [[ACE (cable system)|Africa Coast to Europe]] cable in 2011.

Currently, about a third of the population live below the international poverty line of [[United States dollar|US$]]1.25 per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNDP1&quot;&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf ''Human Development Indices''], Table 3: Human and income poverty, p. 35. Retrieved on 1 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demography of Benin}}
[[File:Kobli1.jpg|thumb|right|Woman from Kobli, Atakora, Benin.]]
The majority of Benin's population lives in the south. The population is young, with a [[life expectancy]] of 59 years. About 42 African ethnic groups live in this country; these various groups settled in Benin at different times and also migrated within the country. Ethnic groups include the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] in the southeast (migrated from Nigeria in the 12th century); the [[Dendi people|Dendi]] in the north-central area (they came from Mali in the 16th century); the [[Bariba people|Bariba]] and the [[Fula people|Fula]] ({{lang-fr|Peul}}; {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}) in the northeast; the Betammaribe and the Somba in the Atacora Range; the Fon in the area around Abomey in the South Central and the Mina, Xueda, and Aja (who came from Togo) on the coast.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

Recent migrations have brought other African nationals to Benin that include Nigerians, Togolese, and Malians. The foreign community also includes many Lebanese and Indians involved in trade and commerce. The personnel of the many European embassies and foreign aid missions and of nongovernmental organizations and various missionary groups account for a large part of the {{gaps|5|500}} European population.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt; A small part of the European population consists of Beninese citizens of [[French people|French ancestry]], whose ancestors ruled Benin and left after independence.

==Health==
{{Main|Health in Benin}}
{{See also|HIV/AIDS in Benin}}
During the 1980s, less than 30 percent of the population had access primary health care services. Benin had one of the highest death rates for children under the age of five in the world. Its [[infant mortality rate]] stood at 203 deaths for every {{gaps|1|000}} live births. Only one in three mothers had access to child health care services. The [[Bamako Initiative]] changed that dramatically by introducing community-based health care reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/inf-new/child6.htm |title=Bamako Initiative revitalizes primary health care in Benin |publisher= |accessdate=2006-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=10173105&amp;dopt=Abstract |title=Implementation of the Bamako Initiative: strategies in Benin and Guinea |publisher= |accessdate=2006-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] has completed three surveys in Benin since 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benin Surveys&quot;&gt;[http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/country_main.cfm?ctry_id=52&amp;c=Benin Benin Surveys],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===Arts===
{{See also|Literature of Benin|Music of Benin}}
Beninese literature had a strong oral tradition long before French became the dominant language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last= |first= |title=Benin |url=http://aflit.arts.uwa.edu.au/CountryBeninEN.html |accessdate=2007-09-30 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felix Couchoro]] wrote the first Beninese novel, ''[[L'Esclave (Beninese novel)|L'Esclave]]'' in [[1929 in literature|1929]].

Post-independence, the country was home to a vibrant and innovative music scene, where native folk music combined with [[Ghana]]ian [[highlife]], French [[cabaret]], American [[rock and roll|rock]], [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]], and [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]lese [[African Rumba|rumba]].

Singer [[Angélique Kidjo]] and actor [[Djimon Hounsou]] were both born in Cotonou, Benin. Composer [[Wally Badarou]] and singer [[Gnonnas Pedro]] are also of Beninese descent.

===Customary names===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
Many Beninois in the south of the country have [[Akan name|Akan-based names]] indicating the day of the week on which they were born.

Naming based on the day of the week is not an Akan invention.  Naming a child after the day of the week in which it was born has its inception in the Yoruba naming custom, which the Gbe speaking people and the Ga took from the Yoruba land upon their departure to their  present areas in Benin, Togo and Ghana. It is through the interaction of the Akan and the Ewe and Ga that the Akan borrow this to their culture. So it is incorrect to say the Fon use Akan base naming system since it is a Yoruba invention.

===Language===
{{main|Languages of Benin}}
Local languages are used as the languages of instruction in elementary schools, with French only introduced after several years. In wealthier cities,  however, French is usually taught at an earlier age. Beninese languages are generally transcribed with a separate letter for each speech sound ([[phoneme]]), rather than using [[diacritic]]s as in French or [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s as in English. This includes Beninese [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], which in [[Nigeria]] is written with both diacritics and digraphs. For instance, the [[mid vowel]]s written ''é è, ô, o'' in French are written ''{{IPA|e, ɛ, o, ɔ}}'' in Beninese languages, whereas the [[consonant]]s written ''ng'' and ''sh'' or ''ch'' in English are written ''ŋ'' and ''c.'' However, digraphs are used for [[nasal vowel]]s and the [[labial-velar consonant]]s ''kp'' and ''gb,'' as in the name of the [[Fon language]] ''Fon gbe'' {{IPA|/fõ ɡ͡be/}}, and diacritics are used as [[tone (linguistics)|tone marks]]. In French-language publications, a mixture of French and Beninese orthographies may be seen.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Benin}}
[[File:Benin - batism ceremony in Cotonou.jpg|thumb|[[Celestial Church of Christ]] baptism in Cotonou. Five percent of Benin's population belongs to the Celestial Church of Christ, an [[African Initiated Church]].]]

In the 2002 census, 42.8% of the population of Benin were [[Christianity|Christian]] (27.1% [[Roman Catholic]], 5% [[Celestial Church of Christ]], 3.2% [[Methodist]], 7.5% other Christian denominations), 24.4% were [[Muslim]], 17.3% practices [[Vodun]], 6% other traditional local religious groups, 1.9% other religious groups, and 6.5% claim no religious affiliation.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90082.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Benin]. United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] (September 14, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous religions include local [[animism|animistic]] religions in the [[Atakora]] (Atakora and Donga provinces) and [[Vodun]] and [[Orisha]] or [[Orisa]] veneration among the Yoruba and Tado peoples in the center and south of the country. The town of [[Ouidah]] on the central coast is the spiritual center of Beninese Vodun.

The major introduced religions are [[Islam]], introduced by the [[Songhai Empire]] and Hausa merchants, and now followed throughout [[Alibori]], [[Borgou]], and [[Donga Department|Donga]] provinces, as well as among the Yoruba (who also follow Christianity), and [[Christianity]], followed throughout the south and center of Benin and in [[Otammari]] country in the [[Atakora]]. Many, however, continue to hold [[Vodun]] and [[Orisha]] beliefs and have incorporated into Christianity the pantheon of [[Vodun]] and [[Orisha]]. The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], a sect originating in the 19th century is also present, in significant minority.

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Benin}}
The [[literacy]] rate in Benin is among the lowest in the world: in 2002 it was estimated to be 34.7% (47.9% for males and 23.3% for females).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Although at one time the education system was not free,&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2000/af/861.htm |title= Benin |work= Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|date= February 23, 2001|section= 5|publisher=United States Department of State |accessdate=2010-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benin has abolished school fees and is carrying out the recommendations of its 2007 Educational Forum.&lt;ref name=UnescoBenin&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/worldwide/africa/benin/ |title=Benin |publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |accessdate=2010-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bermuda''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|b|ɜr|ˈ|m|juː|d|ə}}; officially, '''the Bermudas''' or '''Somers Islands''') is a [[British overseas territory]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]]. Located off the [[east coast of the United States]], its nearest [[landmass]] is [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]], about {{convert|1030|km}} to the west-northwest. It is about {{convert|1373|km}} south of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], Canada, and {{convert|1770|km}} northeast of Miami, Florida. Its [[Capital (political)|capital city]] is [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]].

Bermuda was discovered in 1505 by Spanish navigator [[Juan de Bermúdez]] (who claimed to only find the island inhabited with pigs) after whom the islands are named, who claimed it for the [[Spanish Empire]]. Unoccupied, the island was settled by England in 1609, making it the oldest and most populous remaining British overseas territory. Its first capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]], was established in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the Americas.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web|title=Bermuda – History and Heritage|date=6 November 2007|publisher=Smithsonian.com|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/destination-hunter/bermuda-history-heritage.html|accessdate=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bermuda has an affluent economy, with [[finance]] as its largest sector followed by [[tourism]] &lt;ref name=Smithsonian /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_8330000/newsid_8339800/8339850.stm?bw=bb&amp;;mp=wm&amp;;news=1&amp;;nol_storyid=8339850&amp;;bbcws=1 “Bermuda's Tourism Industry”] Tayfun King, ''Fast Track'', BBC World News (3 Nov. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2005, Bermuda was even claimed to have the world's highest [[GDP per capita]], yet these statistics are hard to verify as Bermuda is not classified as a country but rather as a territory of the U.K. It has a [[subtropics|subtropical]] [[climate]].&lt;ref name=climate&gt;{{cite web|last=Forbes|first=Keith|title=Bermuda Climate and Weather|publisher=[[The Royal Gazette]]|url=http://www.bermuda-online.org/climateweather.htm|accessdate=28 Oct. 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a place of such small size, Bermuda is the location for a considerably high number of shipwrecks.

{{Main|History of Bermuda}}

=== Pre-settlement ===
Bermuda was discovered in 1505 by Spanish explorer [[Juan de Bermudez]].&lt;ref name=Morison1974&gt;{{cite book

Both Spanish and Portuguese ships used the islands as a replenishment spot for fresh meat and water, but legends of [[spirit]]s and devils, now thought to have stemmed only from the callings of raucous birds (most likely the [[Bermuda Petrel]], or ''Cahow''), also the loud noise heard at night from wild hogs and of perpetual, storm-wracked conditions (most early visitors arrived under such conditions) and a surrounding ring of treacherous reefs, kept them from attempting any permanent settlement on the '''Isle of Devils'''

=== Settlement by the English ===
[[Image:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|[[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]] wrote one of the first [[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles|Histories of Bermuda]] (in concert with [[Virginia]] and [[New England]])]]
For the next century, the island is believed to have been visited frequently but not permanently settled. The first two English colonies in Virginia had failed, and a more determined effort was initiated by King [[James I of England]] (James VI of Scotland), who granted a Royal Charter to the [[Virginia Company]]. In 1609, a [[flotilla]] of ships left England under the Company's Admiral, Sir [[George Somers]], and the new Governor of Jamestown, Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]], to relieve the colony of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], settled two years before. Somers had previous experience sailing with both Sir [[Francis Drake]] and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]. The flotilla was broken up by a storm, and the flagship, the ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was wrecked off Bermuda (as depicted on the territory's [[coat of arms of Bermuda|coat of arms]]), leaving the survivors in possession of a new territory. (William Shakespeare's play ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'' is thought to have been inspired by [[William Strachey]]'s account of this shipwreck.) &lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Hobson ''A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest''. Viking (2009) pp. 191–199.&lt;/ref&gt; The island was claimed for the English Crown, and the charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include it. St George's was settled in 1612 and made Bermuda's first capital. It is the oldest continually inhabited English town in the [[New World]].&lt;ref name=Smithsonian /&gt;

In 1615, the colony was passed to a new company, the [[Somers Isles Company]] (''The Somers Isles'' remains an official name for the colony, named after Admiral Somers, just as Gate's Bay and Fort Gates are named after Sir Thomas Gates), formed by the same shareholders. The close ties with Virginia were commemorated even after Bermuda's separation by reference to the archipelago in many Virginian place names, such as [[Hopewell, Virgia|Bermuda City]], and [[Bermuda Hundred, Virginia|Bermuda Hundred]]. The first British coins in America were struck here.

Most of the survivors of the ''Sea Venture'' had carried on to Jamestown in 1610 aboard two Bermuda-built ships. Among them was [[John Rolfe]], who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda, but in Jamestown, married [[Pocahontas]], a daughter of [[Chief Powhatan|Powhatan]]. Intentional settlement of Bermuda began with the arrival of the ''Plough'', in 1612.

=== Company colony ===
Because of its limited land area, Bermuda has had difficulty with over-population. In the first two centuries of settlement it relied on steady human emigration to keep the population manageable. It is often claimed that, before the [[American War of Independence|American Revolution]] more than ten thousand Bermudians (over half of the population) emigrated, primarily to the [[Southern United States|American South]], where Great Britain was displacing Spain as the dominant European imperial power. A steady trickle of outward migration continued. With seafaring being the only real industry, by the end of the 18th century at least a third of the island's manpower was at sea at any one time.

The archipelago's limited land area and resources led to the creation of what may be the earliest conservation laws of the [[New World]]. In 1616 and 1620 acts were passed banning the hunting of certain birds and young tortoises.&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Martin – Planner (Information Systems, Department of Planning – &quot;Developing a small Island GIS: the Bermuda Experience,&quot; Bermuda.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1649, the [[English Civil War]] raged and King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] was beheaded in Whitehall, London. The execution resulted in the outbreak of a Bermudian civil war; it was ended by militias. This created a strong sense of devotion to the crown for the majority of colonists and it forced those who did not swear allegiance, such as [[Puritan]]s and independents, into exile in [[the Bahamas]].&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Keith: [http://www.bermuda-online.org &quot;About Bermuda Online&quot;], The Royal Gazette Ltd. Retrieved 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Bermuda Gazette - 12 November 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Bermuda Gazette of 12 November 1796, calling for privateering against Spain and its allies, and with advertisements for crew for two privateer vessels.]]
In the 17th century the Somers Isles Company suppressed shipbuilding, as it needed Bermudians to farm in order to generate income from the land. Agricultural production met with only limited success, however. The Bermuda cedar boxes used to ship tobacco to England were reportedly worth more than their contents.{{Citation needed|reason=Jan 2008|date=January 2008}} The colony of Virginia far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of [[tobacco]] produced. Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the Company's charter in 1684; the Company itself being dissolved.

=== Maritime economy ===
After the dissolution of the Somers Isle Company, Bermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper (''[[Juniperus bermudiana]]'', also called ''Bermuda cedar'') trees that grew thickly over the whole island. Establishing effective control over the [[Turks Islands]], Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade that became the world's largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century.
Bermudian sailors relied on more than salt, however. they vigorously pursued whaling, [[privateering]], and the merchant trade. Vessels sailed the normal shipping routes, but were required to engage an enemy vessel no matter the size or strength, and as a result many ships were destroyed.
The [[Bermuda sloop]] became highly regarded for speed and maneuverability. The Bermuda sloop {{HMS|Pickle|1800|6}}, one of the fastest vessels in the [[Royal Navy]], brought the news of the victory at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] and the death of [[Admiral Lord Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] back to England.

=== Fortress Bermuda ===

After the [[American Revolution]], the [[Royal Navy]] began improving the harbours and in 1811 started building the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|large dockyard]] on [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland Island]], in the west of the chain, to serve as its principal naval base guarding the western Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes. During the [[War of 1812]] between Britain and the United States, the British attacks on [[Burning of Washington|Washington, D.C. and the Chesapeake]] (which prompted the writing of ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'') were planned and launched from Bermuda where the headquarters of the Royal Navy's 'North American Station' had recently been moved from [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. [[Image:BVRC-Great-War-Contingent 1914.jpg|thumb|The First [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]] Contingent, raised in 1914. By the war's end, the two Bermuda contingents had lost over 75% of their combined strength.]]It was here that the British soldiers assembled before being sent to attack [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. In 1816, James Arnold, the son of [[Benedict Arnold]], fortified Bermuda's Royal Naval Dockyard against possible U.S. attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Howes, James: [http://www.atlascom.us/keys.htm &quot;Attack on Baltimore Launched from Bermuda in 'War of 1812'&quot;] 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the [http://www.bmm.bm/ &quot;Maritime Museum&quot;] occupies the [[Keep]] of the Royal Naval Dockyard, including the Commissioner's House, and exhibits artefacts of the base's military history.

As a result of Bermuda's proximity to the southeastern U.S. coast, it was regularly used by [[Confederate States]] [[blockade runners]] during the [[American Civil War]] to evade Union naval vessels and bring desperately needed war goods to the South from England. The old Globe Hotel in St George's, which was a centre of intrigue for Confederate agents, is preserved as a museum open to the public.

=== Economic and political development ===

In the early 20th century, as modern transport and communication systems developed, Bermuda became a popular destination for wealthy American, Canadian and British tourists arriving by frequent steamship service. In addition, the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]] enacted by the United States against its trading partners in 1930, cut off Bermuda's once-thriving agricultural export trade (primarily lilies and fresh vegetables to the U.S.), spurring the overseas territory to develop its tourist industry.
[[Image:Bermuda harbour 1926.jpg|thumb|left|Bermuda mid-1920s]]
After several failed attempts, in 1930 the first aeroplane reached Bermuda. A [[Stinson Detroiter]] seaplane flying from New York, it had to land in the ocean once because of darkness and then again to refuel. Navigation and weather forecasting improved in 1933 when the [[Royal Air Force]] established a station at Bermuda and operated float planes from the harbour in coordination with the British fleet. In 1936 [[Lufthansa]] began to experiment with seaplane flights from Berlin via the Azores with continuation to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldqslcards.com/UNUSUAL_PLACE.pdf Unusual Place - Unusual Story – Heroic Crew]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, [[Imperial Airways]] and [[Pan American World Airways]] began operating scheduled flying-boat airline services from New York and [[Baltimore]] to [[Darrell's Island, Bermuda]]. In 1948, regularly scheduled commercial airline service by land-based aeroplanes began to [[Kindley Air Force Base|Kindley Field]] (now [[Bermuda International Airport]]), helping tourism to reach its peak in the 1960s–1970s. By the end of the 20th century, international business had supplanted tourism as the dominant sector of Bermuda's economy (see [[#Economy|Economy of Bermuda]]).

The Royal Naval Dockyard, and the attendant military garrison continued to be an important component of Bermuda's economy until the mid-20th century. In addition to considerable building work, the armed forces needed to source food and other materials from local vendors. Beginning in World War II, U.S. military installations also were located in Bermuda (see &quot;Military&quot; section, below, and [[Military of Bermuda]]).

Universal adult suffrage and the development of a two-party political system occurred in the 1960s. Before universal suffrage, adopted as part of Bermuda's Constitution in 1967, voting was based on property ownership (see &quot;Politics&quot; section, below, and [[Politics of Bermuda]]). On 10 March 1973, then-Governor of Bermuda [[Richard Sharples]] was assassinated by local [[Black Power]] militants during a period of civil unrest in the 1970s.

== Geography ==
[[File:Bermuda topographic map-en.png|thumb|250px|Topographic map of Bermuda]]
{{Main|Geography of Bermuda}}
Bermuda is located in the North Atlantic Ocean, near the western edge of the [[Sargasso Sea]], roughly 580 [[nautical miles]] (1070&amp;nbsp;km, 670&amp;nbsp;mi) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] and roughly 590 nautical miles (1100&amp;nbsp;km, 690&amp;nbsp;mi) southeast of [[Martha's Vineyard]]. The island lies due east of [[Fripp Island]], [[South Carolina]]. It has 103&amp;nbsp;km (64&amp;nbsp;mi) of coastline. There are two [[Corporation|incorporated]] [[Municipal government|municipalities]] in Bermuda: the [[Hamilton, Bermuda|City of Hamilton]] and the [[St. George, Bermuda|Town of St George]]. Bermuda is divided into various &quot;parishes,&quot; in which there are some localities called &quot;villages,&quot; such as [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|Flatts Village]], [[Tucker's Town, Bermuda|Tucker's Town]] and [[Somerset, Bermuda|Somerset Village]].

Although usually referred to in the singular, the territory consists of 181 islands, with a total area of 53.3 square kilometres (20.6&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi). The largest island, ''Main Island,'' sometimes itself called ''Bermuda.'' Compiling a list of the islands is often complicated, as many have more than one name (as does the entire archipelago, which has also been known historically as ''La Garza'', ''Virgineola'', and the ''Isle of Devils''). Despite its small land mass, there has been a tendency for place names to be repeated; there are, for example, two islands named ''Long Island,'' and ''[[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's Town]]'' is located on ''[[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St George's Island]]'' within ''[[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St George's Parish]]'' (each known as ''St George's'').

[[Image:Bermuda-divmap.png|thumb|right|300px|Parishes of Bermuda]]

Bermuda is divided into nine [[parish]]es and two [[municipality|municipalities]].

Bermuda's nine parishes:

* [[Devonshire Parish, Bermuda|Devonshire]]
* [[Hamilton Parish, Bermuda|Hamilton]]
* [[Paget Parish, Bermuda|Paget]]
* [[Pembroke Parish, Bermuda|Pembroke]]
* [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St George's]]
* [[Sandys Parish, Bermuda|Sandys]]
* [[Smith's Parish, Bermuda|Smith's]]
* [[Southampton Parish, Bermuda|Southampton]]
* [[Warwick Parish, Bermuda|Warwick]]

Bermuda's two incorporated municipalities:

* [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]] (city)
* [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]] (town)

Bermuda's two informal villages:

* [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|Flatts Village]]
* [[Somerset, Bermuda|Somerset Village]]

Another informal village was planned but abandoned in the parts of the early settlement of the islands, though the name is still used for the area.

* [[Tucker's Town, Bermuda|Tucker's Town]]

== Climate ==
{{Main|Climate of Bermuda}}
Although Bermuda's latitude is similar to that of [[Savannah, Georgia]], it is warmer in winter, and slightly cooler in summer. Its [[humid subtropical climate]]&lt;ref name=climate /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ritter|first= Michael E. |title=The Physical Environment: an Introduction to Physical Geography|year=2006|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]|url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_subtropical.html|accessdate=28 Oct. 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is warmed by the nearby [[Gulf Stream]], thanks to the [[westerlies]], which carry warm, humid air eastwards over Bermuda, helping to keep winter temperatures above freezing. The climate is humid and, as a result, the summertime heat index can be high, even though mid-August temperatures rarely exceed 30 °C (86 °F). Winters are mild, with average daytime temperatures in January and February around 20 °C (68 °F), although [[cold front]]s bring Arctic [[air mass]]es that can result in rapid temperature drops. Atlantic winter storms, often associated with these cold fronts, can produce powerful, gusting winds and heavy rain. Factoring in the [[wind chill]], the [[felt air temperature]] in winter can fall below freezing, 0 °C (32 °F), even though the actual temperature rarely drops below 10 °C (50 °F). The lowest recorded temperature in Bermuda as of 2011 is 7.2 °C (43.6 °F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weather Summary for January 2009|publisher=[[Bermuda Weather Service]]|date=4 February 2003|url=http://www.weather.bm/data/2009-02.html|accessdate=25 Feb. 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bermuda is very susceptible to [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]]. Its position along the [[Gulf Stream]] means that it is often directly in the path of hurricanes recurving in the [[westerlies]], although they have usually begun to weaken as they approach the island. It is often affected by these hurricanes, although the island's small size means that direct [[landfall (meteorology)|landfalls]] are rare. The last hurricane to cause significant damage to the islands was [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|category 3]] [[Hurricane Fabian]] on 5 September 2003.

The only source of fresh water in Bermuda is rainfall, which is collected on roofs and catchments (or drawn from underground lenses) and stored in tanks. Each dwelling usually has at least one of these tanks forming part of its foundation.

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Bermuda}}
Executive authority in Bermuda is vested in [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the monarch]] and is exercised on her behalf by the [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]]. The governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the [[British Government]]. The current governor is [[Richard Gozney|Sir Richard Hugh Turton Gozney KCMG CVO]]; he was sworn in on 12 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Tim. [http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d7c64a30030000&amp;sectionId=60 The Royal Gazette]: Breaking News: New Governor sworn in. 12 December 2007. Retrieved 13, December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a Deputy Governor (currently Mark Andrew Capes [[Justice of the Peace|JP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Matthew.

Retrieved 13 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Defence and foreign affairs remain the responsibility of the United Kingdom, which also retains responsibility to ensure good government. It must approve any changes to the Constitution of Bermuda. Bermuda now exists as an overseas territory of Britain, but it is the oldest British colony. In 1620, a Royal Assent granted Bermuda limited self-governance, thus making the [[Parliament of Bermuda]] the fifth oldest in the world, behind only the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], the [[Tynwald]] of the [[Isle of Man]], the [[Althing]] of [[Iceland]] and [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Pethen, Valarie: Bermuda Report, Second Edition 1985–1988, page 17.
