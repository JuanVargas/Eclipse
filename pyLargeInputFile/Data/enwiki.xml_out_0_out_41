The compliant architecture shares all of Classic Bluetooth’s existing radio and functionality resulting in a negligible cost increase compared to Classic Bluetooth.
* Additionally, manufacturers can use current Classic Bluetooth (Bluetooth v2.1 + EDR or Bluetooth v3.0 + HS) chips with the new low energy stack, enhancing the development of ''Classic Bluetooth'' enabled devices with new capabilities.

On June 12, 2007, Nokia and Bluetooth SIG had announced that [[Wibree]] will be a part of the Bluetooth specification, as an ultra-low power Bluetooth technology.&lt;ref&gt;

On December 17, 2009, the Bluetooth SIG adopted Bluetooth low energy technology as the hallmark feature of the version 4.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Bluetooth/Press/SIG/SIG_INTRODUCES_BLUETOOTH_LOW_ENERGY_WIRELESS_TECHNOLOGY_THE_NEXT_GENERATION_OF_BLUETOOTH_WIRELESS_TE.htm |title=Bluetooth.com |publisher=Bluetooth.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provisional names ''Wibree'' and ''Bluetooth ULP'' (Ultra Low Power) are abandoned.

=== Future ===

The following topics are under consideration. There is no release date published to make these part of an official release.

;Broadcast channel: Enables Bluetooth information points. This will drive the adoption of Bluetooth into mobile phones, and enable advertising models based on users pulling information from the information points, and not based on the object push model that is used in a limited way today.
;Topology management: Enables the automatic configuration of the [[piconet]] topologies especially in [[scatternet]] situations that are becoming more common today. This should all be invisible to users of the technology, while also making the technology &quot;just work.&quot;
;[[Quality of service|QoS]] improvements: Enable audio and video data to be transmitted at a higher quality, especially when best effort traffic is being transmitted in the same [[piconet]].

==== UWB for AMP ====

{{Main|ultra-wideband}}

The high speed (AMP) feature of Bluetooth v3.0 is based on 802.11, but the AMP mechanism was designed to be usable with other radios as well.  It was originally intended for [[Ultra-wideband|UWB]], but the WiMedia Alliance, the body responsible for the flavor of UWB intended for Bluetooth, announced in March 2009 that it was disbanding.

On March 16, 2009, the [[WiMedia Alliance]] announced it was entering into technology transfer agreements for the WiMedia [[Ultra-wideband]] (UWB) specifications. WiMedia has transferred all current and future specifications, including work on future high speed and power optimized implementations, to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), [[Wireless USB]] Promoter Group and the [[USB Implementers Forum]]. After the successful completion of the technology transfer, marketing and related administrative items, the WiMedia Alliance will cease operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimedia.org/ |title=Wimedia.org |publisher=Wimedia.org |date=2010-01-04 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimedia.org/imwp/download.asp?ContentID=15508 |title=Wimedia.org |publisher=Wimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimedia.org/imwp/download.asp?ContentID=15506 |title=Wimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluetooth.com/Bluetooth/Technology/Technology_Transfer/ Bluetooth.com]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usb.org/press/WiMedia_Tech_Transfer/ |title=USB.org |publisher=USB.org |date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incisor.tv/2009/03/what-to-make-of-bluetooth-sig-wimedia.html |title=Incisor.tv |publisher=Incisor.tv |date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009 the Bluetooth Special Interest Group suspended development of UWB as part of the alternative MAC/PHY, Bluetooth v3.0 + HS solution. A small, but significant, number of former [[WiMedia Alliance|WiMedia]] members had not and would not sign up to the necessary agreements for the [[intellectual property|IP]] transfer. The Bluetooth SIG is now in the process of evaluating other options for its longer term roadmap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=J5E0PN3NQ5BNLQE1GHPSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=221100170 Bluetooth group drops ultrawideband, eyes 60 GHz], [http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=J5E0PN3NQ5BNLQE1GHPSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=217201265 Report: Ultrawideband dies by 2013], [http://www.incisor.tv/download.php?file=140november2009.pdf Incisor Magazine November 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Past versions of standard ===

All versions of the Bluetooth standards are designed for downward compatibility. That lets the latest standard cover all older versions.

==== Bluetooth v1.0 and v1.0B ====

Versions 1.0 and 1.0B had many problems, and manufacturers had difficulty making their products interoperable. Versions 1.0 and 1.0B also included mandatory Bluetooth hardware device address (BD_ADDR) transmission in the Connecting process (rendering anonymity impossible at the protocol level), which was a major setback for certain services planned for use in Bluetooth environments.

==== Bluetooth v1.1 ====

*Ratified as [[IEEE 802.15#Task group 1 (WPAN/Bluetooth)|IEEE Standard 802.15.1-2002]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=7932 |title=IEEE Std 802.15.1-2002 – IEEE Standard for Information technology – Telecommunications and information exchange between systems – Local and metropolitan area networks – Specific requirements Part 15.1: Wireless Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs) |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2002.93621 |publisher=Ieeexplore.ieee.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Many errors found in the 1.0B specifications were fixed.
*Added support for non-encrypted channels.
*Received Signal Strength Indicator ([[RSSI]]).

==== Bluetooth v1.2 ====

This version is [[backward compatible]] with 1.1 and the major enhancements include the following:
*Faster Connection and Discovery
*''Adaptive [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] (AFH)'', which improves resistance to [[radio frequency interference]] by avoiding the use of crowded frequencies in the hopping sequence.
*Higher transmission speeds in practice, up to 721 kbit/s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guy Kewney&quot;&gt;{{cite web

*Extended Synchronous Connections (eSCO), which improve voice quality of audio links by allowing retransmissions of corrupted packets, and may optionally increase audio latency to provide better support for concurrent data transfer.
*[[Host Controller Interface]] (HCI) support for three-wire [[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]].

*Introduced Flow Control and Retransmission Modes for L2CAP.

==== Bluetooth v2.0 + EDR ====

This version of the Bluetooth Core Specification was released in 2004 and is backward compatible with the previous version 1.2. The main difference is the introduction of an Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) for [[data transfer rate|faster data transfer]]. The nominal rate of EDR is about 3 Mbit/s, although the practical data transfer rate is 2.1 Mbit/s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guy Kewney&quot;/&gt; EDR uses a combination of [[Gaussian frequency-shift keying|GFSK]] and [[Phase shift keying|Phase Shift Keying]] modulation (PSK) with two variants, π/4-[[DQPSK]] and 8[[DPSK]].&lt;ref name=bluetooth_specs&gt;
{{cite web

|title=Specification Documents
|publisher=Bluetooth SIG
|accessdate=2008-02-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt; EDR can provide a lower power consumption through a reduced [[duty cycle]].

The specification is published as &quot;Bluetooth v2.0 + EDR&quot; which implies that EDR is an optional feature. Aside from EDR, there are other minor improvements to the 2.0 specification, and products may claim compliance to &quot;Bluetooth v2.0&quot; without supporting the higher data rate. At least one commercial device states &quot;Bluetooth v2.0 without EDR&quot; on its data sheet.&lt;ref&gt;

==== Bluetooth v2.1 + EDR ====

Bluetooth Core Specification Version 2.1 + EDR is fully backward compatible with 1.2, and was adopted by the  Bluetooth SIG on July 26, 2007.&lt;ref name=bluetooth_specs /&gt;

The headline feature of 2.1 is secure simple pairing (SSP): this improves the pairing experience for Bluetooth devices, while increasing the use and strength of security. See the section on [[#Pairing|Pairing]] below for more details.&lt;ref&gt;

2.1 allows various other improvements, including &quot;Extended inquiry response&quot; (EIR), which provides more information during the inquiry procedure to allow better filtering of devices before connection; sniff subrating, which reduces the power consumption in low-power mode

==== Bluetooth v3.0 + HS ====

Version 3.0 + HS of the Bluetooth Core Specification&lt;ref name=bluetooth_specs /&gt; was adopted by the [https://www.bluetooth.org/apps/content/ Bluetooth SIG] on April 21, 2009. Bluetooth 3.0+HS supports theoretical data transfer speeds of up to 24 Mbit/s, though not over the Bluetooth link itself. Instead, the Bluetooth link is used for negotiation and establishment, and the high data rate traffic is carried over a colocated 802.11 link. Its main new feature is AMP (Alternate MAC/PHY), the addition of 802.11 as a high speed transport. Two technologies had been anticipated for AMP: 802.11 and [[Ultra-wideband|UWB]], but UWB is missing from the specification.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High-Speed part of the specification is not mandatory, and hence only devices sporting the &quot;+HS&quot; will actually support the Bluetooth over Wifi high-speed data transfer.  A Bluetooth 3.0 device without the HS suffix will not support High Speed, and needs to only support Unicast Connectionless Data (UCD).&lt;ref&gt;{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=40560|title=Bluetooth 3.0+HS specification]|vol=l0|section=4.1 Specification Naming Conventions}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Alternate MAC/PHY: Enables the use of alternative [[Media Access Control|MAC]] and [[PHY]]s for transporting Bluetooth profile data. The Bluetooth radio is still used for device discovery, initial connection and profile configuration, however when large quantities of data need to be sent, the high speed alternate MAC PHY 802.11 (typically associated with Wi-Fi) will be used to transport the data. This means that the proven low power connection models of Bluetooth are used when the system is idle, and the faster radio is used when large quantities of data need to be sent.
;Unicast connectionless data: Permits service data to be sent without establishing an explicit L2CAP channel.  It is intended for use by applications that require low latency between user action and reconnection/transmission of data.  This is only appropriate for small amounts of data.

;Enhanced Power Control: Updates the power control feature to remove the open loop power control, and also to clarify ambiguities in power control introduced by the new modulation schemes added for EDR.  Enhanced power control removes the ambiguities by specifying the behaviour that is expected.  The feature also adds closed loop power control, meaning RSSI filtering can start as the response is received.  Additionally, a &quot;go straight to maximum power&quot; request has been introduced. This is expected to deal with the headset link loss issue typically observed when a user puts their phone into a pocket on the opposite side to the headset.

== Technical information ==
=== Bluetooth protocol stack ===

{{Main|Bluetooth stack|Bluetooth protocols}}
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Bluetooth Protocol Stack.png|thumb|250px|right|Bluetooth Protocol Stack]] --&gt;
&quot;Bluetooth is defined as a layer protocol architecture consisting of core protocols, cable replacement protocols, telephony control protocols, and adopted protocols.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Stallings, William.  (2005).  ''Wireless communications &amp; networks.'='  Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mandatory protocols for all Bluetooth stacks are: LMP, L2CAP and SDP. Additionally, these protocols are almost universally supported: HCI and RFCOMM.

==== LMP (Link Management Protocol) ====
Used for control of the radio link between two devices. Implemented on the controller.

==== L2CAP (Logical Link Control &amp; Adaptation Protocol) ====
Used to multiplex multiple logical connections between two devices using different higher level protocols.
Provides segmentation and reassembly of on-air packets.

In Basic mode, L2CAP provides packets with a payload configurable up to 64kB, with 672 bytes as the default [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]], and 48 bytes as the minimum mandatory supported MTU.

In Retransmission &amp; Flow Control modes, L2CAP can be configured for reliable or isochronous data per channel by performing retransmissions and CRC checks.

Bluetooth Core Specification Addendum 1 adds two additional L2CAP modes to the core specification.  These modes effectively deprecate original Retransmission and Flow Control modes:
* '''Enhanced Retransmission Mode''' (ERTM):  This mode is an improved version of the original retransmission mode.  This mode provides a reliable L2CAP channel.
* '''Streaming Mode''' (SM): This is a very simple mode, with no retransmission or flow control. This mode provides an unreliable L2CAP channel.

Reliability in any of these modes is optionally and/or additionally guaranteed by the lower layer Bluetooth BDR/EDR air interface by configuring the number of retransmissions and flush timeout (time after which the radio will flush packets). In-order sequencing is guaranteed by the lower layer.

Only L2CAP channels configured in ERTM or SM may be operated over AMP logical links.

==== SDP (Service Discovery Protocol) ====
Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) allows a device to discover services supported by other devices, and their associated parameters. For example, when connecting a mobile phone to a Bluetooth headset, SDP will be used for determining which [[Bluetooth profile]]s are supported by the headset (Headset Profile, Hands Free Profile, [[Advanced Audio Distribution Profile|Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)]] etc.) and the protocol multiplexer settings needed to connect to each of them. Each service is identified by a [[Universally Unique Identifier]] (UUID), with official services (Bluetooth profiles) assigned a short form UUID (16 bits rather than the full 128)

==== HCI (Host/Controller Interface) ====
Standardised communication between the host stack (e.g., a PC or mobile phone OS) and the controller (the Bluetooth IC). This standard allows the host stack or controller IC to be swapped with minimal adaptation.

There are several HCI transport layer standards, each using a different hardware interface to transfer the same command, event and data packets.  The most commonly used are [[USB]] (in PCs) and [[UART]] (in mobile phones and PDAs).

In Bluetooth devices with simple functionality (e.g., headsets) the host stack and controller can be implemented on the same microprocessor. In this case the HCI is optional, although often implemented as an internal software interface.

==== RFCOMM (Serial Port Emulation) ====

Radio frequency communications (RFCOMM) is a cable replacement protocol used to create a virtual serial data stream.  RFCOMM provides for binary data transport and emulates [[EIA-232]] (formerly RS-232) control signals over the Bluetooth baseband layer.

RFCOMM provides a simple reliable data stream to the user, similar to TCP. It is used directly by many telephony related profiles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       as a carrier for AT commands, as well as being a transport layer for OBEX over Bluetooth.

Many Bluetooth applications use RFCOMM because of its widespread support and publicly available API on most operating systems. Additionally, applications that used a serial port to communicate can be quickly ported to use RFCOMM.

==== BNEP (Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol) ====

BNEP is used for transferring another protocol stack's data via an L2CAP channel.
Its main purpose is the transmission of IP packets in the Personal Area Networking Profile.
BNEP performs a similar function to [[Subnetwork Access Protocol|SNAP]] in Wireless LAN.

==== AVCTP (Audio/Video Control Transport Protocol) ====

Used by the remote control profile to transfer AV/C commands over an L2CAP channel. The music control buttons on a stereo headset use this protocol to control the music player.

==== AVDTP (Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol) ====

Used by the advanced audio distribution profile to stream music to stereo headsets over an L2CAP channel.
Intended to be used by video distribution profile in the bluetooth transmission.

==== Telephony control protocol ====
Telephony control protocol-binary (TCS BIN) is the bit-oriented protocol that defines the call control signaling for the establishment of voice and data calls between Bluetooth devices.  Additionally, &quot;TCS BIN defines mobility management procedures for handling groups of Bluetooth TCS devices.&quot;

TCS-BIN is only used by the cordless telephony profile, which failed to attract implementers. As such it is only of historical interest.

==== Adopted protocols ====
Adopted protocols are defined by other standards-making organizations and incorporated into Bluetooth’s protocol stack, allowing Bluetooth to create protocols only when necessary.  The adopted protocols include:
;Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP): Internet standard protocol for transporting IP datagrams over a point-to-point link.
;TCP/IP/UDP: Foundation Protocols for TCP/IP protocol suite
;Object Exchange Protocol (OBEX): Session-layer protocol for the exchange of objects, providing a model for object and operation representation
;Wireless Application Environment/Wireless Application Protocol (WAE/WAP): WAE specifies an application framework for wireless devices and WAP is an open standard to provide mobile users access to telephony and information services.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;

=== Baseband Error Correction ===
Three types of [[error correction]] are implemented in Bluetooth systems,
*1/3 rate [[forward error correction]] (FEC)
*2/3 rate FEC
*[[Automatic repeat-request]] (ARQ)

=== Setting up connections ===
Any Bluetooth device in ''discoverable mode'' will transmit the following information on demand:
*Device name
*Device class
*List of services
*Technical information (for example:  device features, manufacturer, Bluetooth specification used, clock offset)

Any device may perform an inquiry to find other devices to connect to, and any device can be configured to respond to such inquiries. However, if the device trying to connect knows the address of the device, it always responds to direct connection requests and transmits the information shown in the list above if requested. Use of a device's services may require pairing or acceptance by its owner, but the connection itself can be initiated by any device and held until it goes out of range. Some devices can be connected to only one device at a time, and connecting to them prevents them from connecting to other devices and appearing in inquiries until they disconnect from the other device.

Every device has a unique 48-bit address. However, these addresses are generally not shown in inquiries. Instead, friendly Bluetooth names are used, which can be set by the user. This name appears when another user scans for devices and in lists of paired devices.

Most phones have the Bluetooth name set to the manufacturer and model of the phone by default. Most phones and laptops show only the Bluetooth names and special programs are required to get additional information about remote devices. This can be confusing as, for example, there could be several phones in range named [[Sony Ericsson T610|T610]] (see [[Bluejacking]]).

=== Pairing ===
==== Motivation ====
Many of the services offered over Bluetooth can expose private data or allow the connecting party to control the Bluetooth device. For security reasons it is therefore necessary to control which devices are allowed to connect to a given Bluetooth device. At the same time, it is useful for Bluetooth devices to automatically establish a connection without user intervention as soon as they are in range.

To resolve this conflict, Bluetooth uses a process called ''pairing''. Two devices need to be ''paired'' to communicate with each other. The pairing process is typically triggered automatically the first time a device receives a connection request from a device with which it is not yet paired (in some cases the device user may need to make the device's Bluetooth link visible to other devices first). Once a pairing has been established it is remembered by the devices, which can then connect to each without user intervention. When desired, the pairing relationship can later be removed by the user.

==== Implementation ====
During the pairing process, the two devices involved establish a relationship by creating a [[shared secret]] known as a ''link key''. If a link key is stored by both devices they are said to be ''paired'' or ''bonded''. A device that wants to communicate only with a bonded device can [[cryptography|cryptographically]] [[authentication|authenticate]] the identity of the other device, and so be sure that it is the same device it previously paired with. Once a link key has been generated, an authenticated ACL link between the devices may be [[encryption|encrypted]] so that the data that they exchange over the airwaves is protected against [[eavesdropping]].

Link keys can be deleted at any time by either device.  If done by either device this will implicitly remove the bonding between the devices; so it is possible for one of the devices to have a link key stored but not be aware that it is no longer bonded to the device associated with the given link key.

Bluetooth services generally require either encryption or authentication, and as such require pairing before they allow a remote device to use the given service.  Some services, such as the Object Push Profile, elect not to explicitly require authentication or encryption so that pairing does not interfere with the user experience associated with the service use-cases.

==== Pairing mechanisms ====
Pairing mechanisms have changed significantly with the introduction of Secure Simple Pairing in Bluetooth v2.1. The following summarizes the pairing mechanisms:
* '''Legacy pairing''': This is the only method available in Bluetooth v2.0 and before. Each device must enter a [[Personal identification number|PIN code]]; pairing is only successful if both devices enter the same PIN code.  Any 16-byte UTF-8 string may be used as a PIN code, however not all devices may be capable of entering all possible PIN codes.
** '''Limited input devices''': The obvious example of this class of device is a Bluetooth Hands-free headset, which generally have few inputs.  These devices usually have a ''fixed PIN'', for example &quot;0000&quot; or &quot;1234&quot;, that are hard-coded into the device.
** '''Numeric input devices''': Mobile phones are classic examples of these devices. They allow a user to enter a numeric value up to 16 digits in length.
** '''Alpha-numeric input devices''': PCs and smartphones are examples of these devices. They allow a user to enter full UTF-8 text as a PIN code.  If pairing with a less capable device the user needs to be aware of the input limitations on the other device, there is no mechanism available for a capable device to determine how it should limit the available input a user may use.
* '''Secure Simple Pairing''' (SSP): This is required by Bluetooth v2.1. A Bluetooth v2.1 device may only use legacy pairing to interoperate with a v2.0 or earlier device. Secure Simple Pairing uses a form of [[public key cryptography]], and has the following modes of operation:
** '''Just works''': As implied by the name, this method just works. No user interaction is required; however, a device may prompt the user to confirm the pairing process. This method is typically used by headsets with very limited IO capabilities, and is more secure than the fixed PIN mechanism which is typically used for legacy pairing by this set of limited devices. This method provides no [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man in the middle]] (MITM) protection.
** '''Numeric comparison''': If both devices have a display and at least one can accept a binary Yes/No user input, they may use Numeric Comparison. This method displays a 6-digit numeric code on each device. The user should compare the numbers to ensure they are identical. If the comparison succeeds, the user(s) should confirm pairing on the device(s) that can accept an input. This method provides MITM protection, assuming the user confirms on both devices and actually performs the comparison properly.
** '''Passkey Entry''': This method may be used between a device with a display and a device with numeric keypad entry (such as a keyboard), or two devices with numeric keypad entry. In the first case, the display is used to show a 6-digit numeric code to the user, who then enters the code on the keypad.  In the second case, the user of each device enters the same 6-digit number. Both cases provide MITM protection.
** '''Out of band''' (OOB): This method uses an external means of communication, such as [[Near Field Communication]] (NFC) to exchange some information used in the pairing process. Pairing is completed using the Bluetooth radio, but requires information from the OOB mechanism. This provides only the level of MITM protection that is present in the OOB mechanism.

SSP is considered simple for the following reasons:
* In most cases, it does not require a user to generate a passkey.
* For use-cases not requiring MITM protection, user interaction has been eliminated.
* For ''numeric comparison'', MITM protection can be achieved with a simple equality comparison by the user.
* Using OOB with NFC will enable pairing when devices simply get close, rather than requiring a lengthy discovery process.

==== Security Concerns ====
Prior to Bluetooth v2.1, encryption is not required and can be turned off at any time. Moreover, the encryption key is only good for approximately 23.5 hours; using a single encryption key longer than this time allows simple [[Stream cipher attack|XOR attacks]] to retrieve the encryption key.
* Turning off encryption is required for several normal operations, so it is problematic to detect if encryption is disabled for a valid reason or for a security attack.
* Bluetooth v2.1 addresses this in the following ways:
** Encryption is required for all non-SDP (Service Discovery Protocol) connections
** A new Encryption Pause and Resume feature is used for all normal operations requiring encryption to be disabled. This enables easy identification of normal operation from security attacks.
** The encryption key is required to be refreshed before it expires.
Link keys may be stored on the device file system, not on the Bluetooth chip itself. Many Bluetooth chip manufacturers allow link keys to be stored on the device; however, if the device is removable this means that the link key will move with the device.

=== Air interface ===
The [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] operates in the license-free [[ISM band]] at 2.402-2.480&amp;nbsp;[[GHz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;D. Chomienne, M. Eftimakis&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|date=2010-10-20
|accessdate=2009-12-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To avoid interfering with other protocols that use the 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz band, the Bluetooth protocol divides the band into 79&amp;nbsp;channels (each 1&amp;nbsp;MHz wide) and changes channels up to 1600 times per second. Implementations with versions 1.1 and 1.2 reach speeds of 723.1&amp;nbsp;[[kilobit per second|kbit/s]]. Version 2.0 implementations feature Bluetooth Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) and reach 2.1&amp;nbsp;[[Mbit/s]]. Technically, version 2.0 devices have a higher power consumption, but the three times faster rate reduces the transmission times, effectively reducing power consumption to half that of 1.x devices (assuming equal traffic load).

== Security ==
=== Overview ===
Bluetooth implements [[confidentiality]], [[authentication]] and [[key (cryptography)|key]] derivation with custom algorithms based on the [[SAFER|SAFER+]] [[block cipher]].
Bluetooth key generation is generally based on a Bluetooth PIN, which must be entered into both devices. This procedure might be modified if one of the devices has a fixed PIN (e.g., for headsets or similar devices with a restricted user interface).
During pairing, an initialization key or master key is generated, using the E22 algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=2009-01-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[E0 (cipher)|E0]] stream cipher is used for encrypting packets, granting confidentiality and is based on a shared cryptographic secret, namely a previously generated link key or master key.
Those keys, used for subsequent encryption of data sent via the air interface, rely on the Bluetooth PIN, which has been entered into one or both devices.

An overview of Bluetooth vulnerabilities exploits was published in 2007 by Andreas Becker.&lt;ref&gt;

In September 2008, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published a Guide to Bluetooth Security that will serve as reference to organizations on the security capabilities of Bluetooth and steps for securing Bluetooth technologies effectively.  While Bluetooth has its benefits, it is susceptible to denial of service attacks, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, message modification, and resource misappropriation.  Users/organizations must evaluate their acceptable level of risk and incorporate security into the lifecycle of Bluetooth devices.  To help mitigate risks, included in the NIST document are security checklists with guidelines and recommendations for creating and maintaining secure Bluetooth piconets, headsets, and smart card readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Bluetooth v2.1 - finalized in 2007 with consumer devices first appearing in 2009 - makes significant changes to Bluetooth's security, including pairing.  See the [[#Pairing mechanisms]] section for more about these changes.

=== Bluejacking ===
{{main|Bluejacking}}
Bluejacking is the sending of either a picture or a message from one user to an unsuspecting user through'' Bluetooth'' wireless technology.  Common applications include short messages (e.g., &quot;You’ve just been bluejacked!&quot;).
&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=2008-05-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bluejacking does not involve the removal or alteration of any data from the device. Bluejacking can also involve taking control of a mobile wirelessly and phoning a premium rate line, owned by the bluejacker.

=== History of security concerns ===
==== Early ====

In 2001, Jakobsson and Wetzel from [[Bell Laboratories]] discovered flaws in the Bluetooth pairing protocol and also pointed to vulnerabilities in the encryption scheme.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|title=Security Weaknesses in Bluetooth

|accessdate=2009-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Ben and Adam Laurie from A.L. Digital Ltd. discovered that serious flaws in some poor implementations of Bluetooth security may lead to disclosure of personal data.&lt;ref&gt;

A new attack called [[Bluebugging|BlueBug]] was used for this experiment.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|title=BlueBug

|accessdate=2007-02-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the first purported [[computer virus|virus]] using Bluetooth to spread itself among mobile phones appeared on the [[Symbian OS]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

|publisher=The Register
|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/15/symbian_virus/
|accessdate=2007-02-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The virus was first described by [[Kaspersky Lab]] and requires users to confirm the installation of unknown software before it can propagate.  The virus was written as a proof-of-concept by a group of virus writers known as &quot;29A&quot; and sent to anti-virus groups. Thus, it should be regarded as a potential (but not real) security threat to Bluetooth  technology or [[Symbian OS]] since the virus has never spread outside of this system. In August 2004, a world-record-setting experiment (see also [[Bluetooth sniping]]) showed that the range of Class 2 Bluetooth radios could be extended to 1.78&amp;nbsp;km (1.08 mile) with directional antennas and signal amplifiers.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|title=Long Distance Snarf
|publisher=Trifinite.org
|url=http://trifinite.org/trifinite_stuff_lds.html
|accessdate=2007-02-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This poses a potential security threat because it enables attackers to access vulnerable Bluetooth devices from a distance beyond expectation. The attacker must also be able to receive information from the victim to set up a connection. No attack can be made against a Bluetooth device unless the attacker knows its Bluetooth address and which channels to transmit on.

==== 2005 ====
In January 2005, a mobile malware worm known as Lasco.A began targeting mobile phones using Symbian OS (Series 60 platform) using Bluetooth enabled devices to replicate itself and spread to other devices.  The worm is self-installing and begins once the mobile user approves the transfer of the file (velasco.sis ) from another device.  Once installed, the worm begins looking for other Bluetooth enabled devices to infect.  Additionally, the worm infects other .SIS files on the device, allowing replication to another device through use of removable media (Secure Digital, Compact Flash, etc.).  The worm can render the mobile device unstable.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] security researchers published results of their actual implementation of passive attacks against the PIN-based pairing between commercial Bluetooth devices, confirming the attacks to be practicably fast and the Bluetooth symmetric key establishment method to be vulnerable. To rectify this vulnerability, they carried out an implementation which showed that stronger, asymmetric key establishment is feasible for certain classes of devices, such as mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;

In June 2005, [http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~shakedy Yaniv Shaked] and [http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~yash/ Avishai Wool] published a paper describing both passive and active methods for obtaining the PIN for a Bluetooth link. The passive attack allows a suitably equipped attacker to eavesdrop on communications and spoof, if the attacker was present at the time of initial pairing. The active method makes use of a specially constructed message that must be inserted at a specific point in the protocol, to make the master and slave repeat the pairing process. After that, the first method can be used to crack the PIN. This attack's major weakness is that it requires the user of the devices under attack to re-enter the PIN during the attack when the device prompts them to. Also, this active attack probably requires custom hardware, since most commercially available Bluetooth devices are not capable of the timing necessary.&lt;ref&gt;

In August 2005, police in [[Cambridgeshire]], England, issued warnings about thieves using Bluetooth enabled phones to track other devices left in cars. Police are advising users to ensure that any mobile networking connections are de-activated if laptops and other devices are left in this way.&lt;ref&gt;

They also demonstrated the first Bluetooth PIN and Linkkeys cracker, which is based on the research of Wool and Shaked.

== Health concerns ==
{{Main|Wireless electronic devices and health}}

Bluetooth uses the [[microwave]] [[radio frequency]] spectrum in the 2.402&amp;nbsp;GHz to 2.480&amp;nbsp;GHz range.&lt;ref name=&quot;D. Chomienne, M. Eftimakis&quot;/&gt;
Maximum power output from a Bluetooth radio is 100&amp;nbsp;mW, 2.5&amp;nbsp;mW, and 1&amp;nbsp;mW for Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 devices respectively, which puts Class 1 at roughly the same level as mobile phones, and the other two classes much lower.&lt;ref&gt;

Accordingly, Class 2 and Class 3 Bluetooth devices are considered less of a potential hazard than mobile phones, and Class 1 may be comparable to that of mobile phones : the maximum for a Class 1 is 100&amp;nbsp;mW for Bluetooth but 250&amp;nbsp;mW for [[UMTS]] [[W-CDMA]], 1&amp;nbsp;W for [[GSM frequency bands|GSM1800/1900]] and 2&amp;nbsp;W for [[GSM frequency bands|GSM850/900]] for instance.

The '''Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG)''' is the [[standards organisation|body]] that oversees the development of [[Bluetooth]] [[standardization|standards]] and the licensing of the Bluetooth technologies and [[trademark]]s to manufacturers. The SIG is a privately held, not-for-profit trade association founded in September 1998.  The SIG is headquartered in [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] with [[Michael W. Foley]] (Mike) presently its [[executive director]].  The SIG has local offices in Hong Kong,Taiwan and Beijing, China, Seoul, Korea, Tokyo, Japan and Malmö, Sweden.

The SIG itself does not make, manufacture or sell ''Bluetooth'' enabled products.

==Introduction==
''Bluetooth'' technology provides a way to exchange information between [[wireless]] devices such as [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), [[mobile phone]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[computer]]s, [[Computer printer|printers]] and [[digital camera]]s via a secure, low-cost, globally available short-range [[radio]] [[frequency]] band. Originally developed by [[Ericsson]], ''Bluetooth'' technology is now used in many different products by many different [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]]. These manufacturers must be either Associate or Promoter members of(see below) the Bluetooth SIG before they are granted early access to the ''Bluetooth'' specifications, but published ''Bluetooth'' specifications are available online via the Bluetooth SIG Website [http://www.bluetooth.com/ENGLISH/TECHNOLOGY/Pages/default.aspx]. 

The SIG owns the ''Bluetooth'' word mark, figure mark and combination mark.  These trademarks are licensed out for use to companies that are incorporating ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology into their products.  To become a licensee, a company must become a member of the Bluetooth SIG.  The SIG also manages the Bluetooth SIG Qualification program, a certification process required for any product using ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology and a pre-condition of the intellectual property license for ''Bluetooth'' technology. The main tasks for the SIG are to publish the ''Bluetooth'' specifications, protect the ''Bluetooth'' trademarks and evangelize ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology.

At its inception in 1998, the Bluetooth SIG was primarily run by a staff effectively seconded from its member companies. In 2001 Tom Siep served as the group's Managing Director and from 2002-2004 Mike McCamon led the group as its Executive Director.  In 2004 he was replaced by [[Michael W. Foley]] (Mike).  Beginning in 2002 a professional staff was hired, composed of operations, [[engineering]] and [[marketing]] specialists. From 2002-2004 the Bluetooth SIG was based in [[Overland Park, Kansas]] USA and is now based in [[Kirkland, Washington]]. In addition to its professional staff, the SIG is supported by its more than 13,000 member companies who participate in the various working groups that produce the standardization documents and oversee the qualification process for new products and help to evangelize the technology.

==Structure==
The [[Special Interest Group|SIG]] members participate in Study Groups, Expert Groups, Working Groups along with committees [https://www.bluetooth.org/bluetooth/landing/sig_groups.php].


===Study groups===
The Study Groups carry out research into their various areas which informs the development of the Bluetooth specifications. They may eventually become Working Groups in their own right. 

===Expert groups===
The Expert Groups deal with issues of technical importance to all aspects of ''Bluetooth'' development. As with the Study Groups their work informs the Working Groups as well as the corporate groups. 
Participation in the Expert Groups is restricted to [[#Promoter members|Promoter members]] and [[#Associate members|Associate members]].

===Working Groups===
The Working Groups develop new Bluetooth specifications and enhance adopted specifications.  They are responsible for the vast majority of published standards and specifications.  Participation in the Working Groups is restricted to [[#Promoter members|Promoter members]] and [[#Associate members|Associate members]].

===Committees===
The committees of the SIG deal with the other aspects of licensing, marketing and review including developing and maintaining the Qualification Process, oversight of the ''Bluetooth'' specifications, and developing, improving and maintaining the test methodology and concepts as well as other strategic functions.

==Membership==
Any company incorporating ''Bluetooth'' wireless technology into products, using the technology to offer goods and services or simply re-branding a product with ''Bluetooth'' technology must become a member of the Bluetooth SIG. There are three levels of corporate membership totaling more than 13,000 members, and individuals from member companies may also participate.

===Promoter members===
These members are the most active in the SIG and have considerable influence over both the strategic and technological directions of Bluetooth as a whole. The current promoter members are:
 
*[[Ericsson|Ericsson Technology Licensing]] (founder member)
*[[Intel]] (founder member)
*[[Lenovo]]  (since 2005)
*[[Microsoft]] (since 2008)
*[[Motorola]] (since 1999)
*[[Nokia]] (founder member)
*[[Toshiba]] (founder member)
(list of Promoter members per Bluetooth SIG website at http://www.bluetooth.com/English/SIG/Pages/default.aspx)

Each Promoter member has one seat (and one vote) on the Board of Directors and the Qualification Review Board (the body responsible for developing and maintaining the qualification process). They each may have multiple staff in the various working groups and committees that comprise the work of the SIG.

The SIG's website carries a [https://www.bluetooth.org/apps/directory/default.aspx] full list of  members].

===Associate members===
The Bluetooth SIG Associate membership fees have stayed the same since 2006.  Associate membership is renewed annually and the yearly fee depends on the individual company's revenue. Companies with annual revenue in excess of $100M US are considered Large Associates and pay annual membership fees of $35,000 US.  Small Associates are categorized as those organizations with revenue less than $100M US and join the SIG with an annual membership fee of $7500 US.  Associate members of the SIG get early access to draft specifications at versions 0.5 and 0.7 and are eligible to participate and gain a voting seat in working groups and committees--a key opportunity to work with other Associate and Promoter members on enhancing existing specifications. They are also eligible for enhanced marketing support, receive discounts on product qualification listings and SIG events including the annual All Hands Meeting and UnPlugFest (UPF) testing events.

===Adopter members===
Adopter membership in the SIG is free and entitles members to use published ''Bluetooth '' wireless specifications and ''Bluetooth'' trademarks.  Adopter members do not have early access to unpublished specifications and may not participate in working groups or committees to influence the development of the technology. 

===Individuals===
Membership is not currently open to individuals.  

===Universities===
Universities are accepted for membership.  The person registering the institution must have the power and authority to accept the Membership Agreements [https://www.bluetooth.org/apps/content/?doc_id=44514] on behalf of the school.  Note that students may not register their school, but may create user accounts on the SIG membership portal, [http://www.bluetooth.org www.bluetooth.org], that are associated with their school's existing SIG membership.

==Qualification==
Next to the development of the technology itself, the qualification process is one of the most important aspects of ''Bluetooth'' technology, supporting interoperability, conformance to the ''Bluetooth '' specifications, and to strengthening the ''Bluetooth'' brand.  ''Bluetooth'' Qualification is a requirement for any product using the technology and a precondition of the intellectual property license for ''Bluetooth'' technology.  An overview of the process including steps of the Qualification Process and Qualification Types and Fees is available on the Bluetooth SIG public portal, [http://www.bluetooth.com/English/Technology/Building/Pages/Qualifications.aspx]. 

The Qualification program enables members to perform most or all of the required Qualification testing, assessment and listing functions.  ''Bluetooth'' Qualification Experts (BQEs) and ''Bluetooth'' Qualification Test Facilities (BQTFs) are still available to members for support of the Qualification process, but are now an optional service.  Note that BQTFs are still a requirement for any tests that are CAT-A.  Members who are uncertain or unfamiliar with the Qualification Process are encouraged to consider use of one or both of these service types.

'''Boney M.''' is a [[disco]] group created by German [[record producer]] [[Frank Farian]]. Originally based in [[West Germany]], the four original members of the group's official line-up were [[Jamaica]]ns [[Liz Mitchell]] and [[Marcia Barrett]], [[Maizie Williams]] from [[Montserrat]] and [[Bobby Farrell]] from [[Aruba]]. The group was formed in 1975 and achieved popularity during the [[disco]] era of the late 1970s.

==History==
German [[singer-songwriter]] Frank Farian (real name Franz Reuther) recorded the dance track &quot;[[Baby Do You Wanna Bump]]&quot; in December 1974. Farian sang the repeated line &quot;Do you do you wanna bump?&quot; in a deep voice (entirely studio created) as well as performing the high [[falsetto]] chorus. When the record was released as a single, it was credited to &quot;Boney M.&quot;, a pseudonym Farian had created for himself after watching the Australian detective show ''[[Boney (TV series)|Boney]]''. After a slow start, the song became a hit in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. It was then that Farian decided to hire performers to 'front' the group for TV performances. The Katja Wolfe booking agency found model-turned-singer [[Maizie Williams]] (originally from [[Montserrat]]) and her [[Jamaica]]n singer friend [[Sheyla Bonnick]] for him, along with a dancer known only as &quot;Mike&quot; for the first gigs. Also during 1975, a girl named Nathalie joined but was soon replaced by [[Claudja Barry]]. Then Bonnick and Mike left, and Maizie Williams brought in [[Bobby Farrell]], an exotic male dancer from [[Aruba]]. Singer [[Marcia Barrett]] (also from [[Jamaica]]) joined the group, which then went through another change in line-up when Claudja Barry – tired of merely [[lip-synching]] – left in February 1976 to pursue a solo career as a disco singer. Finally [[Liz Mitchell]], former member of the [[Les Humphries Singers]], stepped in. The line-up was finalised with [[Liz Mitchell]], [[Maizie Williams]], [[Marcia Barrett]], and [[Bobby Farrell]].

===Take the Heat Off Me===
Boney M.'s first album, ''[[Take the Heat Off Me]]'', was released in 1976. It contained tracks that Marcia Barrett had already recorded with Farian, including the title track and &quot;Lovin' or Leavin'&quot;, both of which were previously recorded in German by another Farian act, [[Gilla]]. As Maizie Williams' voice wasn't considered suitable for recording purposes by Farian, and a try-out with Bobby Farrell performing &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; didn't work, Farian decided to use only Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett along with his own studio-enhanced voice to create the Boney M. sound. 

Liz Mitchell claimed that only she and Farian had sung on the hit recordings, but that Farrell did, however, perform live in some of the various later touring incarnations of 'Boney M'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Whatever happened to Boney M?| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1787544.stm |accessdate=30 December 2010 | work=BBC News | date=29 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's commercial performance was initially lukewarm. However, the group rigorously toured discos, clubs and even country fairs to earn a reputation for themselves. The group's big break came when, at the end of summer 1976, German television producer Michael 'Mike' Leckebusch (of [[Radio Bremen]]) requested the group for his show ''[[Musikladen]]''. Boney M. appeared on the live music show on September 18, 1976, after 10 pm and in their daring stage costumes, where they performed the song &quot;[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]&quot;. The song quickly went to no.1 in Germany, with the album following the success of the single. Another single, &quot;[[Sunny (song)|Sunny]]&quot; (a cover of the 1966 [[Bobby Hebb]] song) gave the group their second no.1 hit. The group's popularity had also grown throughout Europe, with &quot;Daddy Cool&quot; reaching no.1 in Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and Austria. Both singles were also Top 10 hits in the UK which would become one of their biggest markets.

===Love For Sale===
In 1977, Boney M. released their second album, ''[[Love for Sale (Boney M. album)|Love for Sale]]'', which contained the hits &quot;[[Ma Baker]]&quot; and &quot;[[Belfast (Boney M. song)|Belfast]]&quot;. The group embarked on their first major concert tours with a live band of musicians called 'The Black Beautiful Circus' (given their name after Maizie Williams' first band, 'Black Beautiful People'). Though slow to start, ''Love for Sale'' made the UK Top 20 and was certified Gold a year after its release. Both singles from the album reached no.1 in Germany and the UK Top 10. By this time, sales had also slowly increased for their first album which had only peaked at no.40 in the UK but was now certified Silver.

===Nightflight to Venus===
1978 was the group's biggest year. They released a new double A-sided single, &quot;[[Rivers of Babylon]]/[[Brown Girl in the Ring (song)|Brown Girl in the Ring]]&quot;, which became a massive hit all over Europe, reaching #1 in several countries as well as becoming one of the biggest selling singles of all time in the [[UK]]. It also became their most successful single in the [[United States]], peaking at #30 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. pop singles chart]]. Following this came their biggest-selling album, ''[[Nightflight to Venus]]'', which spawned another hit single, &quot;[[Rasputin (song)|Rasputin]]&quot;. Continuing with their success, they released &quot;[[Mary's Boy Child - Oh My Lord|Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord]]&quot;, which was the 1978 [[List of Christmas number one singles (UK)|Christmas number one single]] in the United Kingdom and became another of the biggest selling singles of all time there. Also during 1978, Boney M. made a much publicized promotional visit to the [[Soviet Union]], one of the very few Western acts along with [[Elton John]] to do so. Although tracks like &quot;Rasputin&quot; were not released in the Soviet Union due to their lyrics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/Boney-M-Nightflight-To-Venus/release/442427 Бони М* - Ночной Полет На Венеру (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the band was welcomed by the Soviet regime and this visit resulted in an enormous popularity in the entire former [[Eastern Bloc]] that has lasted for more than three decades. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

While it had never been a secret that Bobby Farrell never was in the studio providing vocals for the studio recordings (Farian did the male vocals in the studio), in 1978 it became public knowledge that Maizie Williams did not sing on the studio recordings either &quot;since her voice wasn't suited for this kind of music&quot;, as Farian stated in an interview with German teen magazine ''[[Bravo (magazine)|Bravo]]''. Since this had become common practice within the disco genre of the late '70s, few people cared – unlike when Farian did the same thing with [[Milli Vanilli]] in the late 1980s. While only two of Boney M.'s official members actually contributed to the band's records, all four members of the group, including Maizie Williams and Bobby Farrell, performed the vocals live at Boney M. concerts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musiclange.dk/ Fantastic Boney M.]&lt;/ref&gt; The band's live sound was also augmented by several backing vocalists, which served to enhance any vocal deficiencies the group may have had compared with the studio productions.

===Oceans of Fantasy===
1979 saw Boney M. release a brand new single, &quot;Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday&quot;, which became another Top 10 hit across Europe. Later in the year they released their fourth album, ''[[Oceans of Fantasy]]'', containing two hit singles – [[El Lute / Gotta Go Home|&quot;Gotta Go Home&quot;/&quot;El Lute&quot;]] and [[I'm Born Again / Bahama Mama|&quot;I'm Born Again&quot;/&quot;Bahama Mama&quot;]]. The track &quot;No More Chain Gang&quot;, one of a number of black freedom songs the group recorded, exemplified Boney M.'s mix of white and black music. The album also included a &quot;Lead&quot; and &quot;Backing Vocals&quot; credit for the first time. The album made no.1 in the UK and was certified Platinum, though their run of Top 10 singles had now ended with &quot;Gotta Go Home&quot; peaking at no.12 and &quot;I'm Born Again&quot; peaking at 35.

===The 1980s===
In 1980, Boney M. released a greatest hits album, ''[[The Magic of Boney M. - 20 Golden Hits]]'', which also contained two new songs, &quot;My Friend Jack&quot; and &quot;I See a Boat on the River&quot;. It made the #1 spot in the UK, reaching Gold status within six weeks of release, though it was their last big-selling album in the UK.

Boney M.'s fifth album had been scheduled for release in November 1980 but the recording sessions dragged on all through 1981. When ''[[Boonoonoonoos]]'' was finally released by the end of that year, Bobby Farrell was fired from the group due to his unreliability. While still a healthy seller in continental Europe, &quot;Boonoonoonoos&quot; failed to crack the UK Top 100 after three consecutive #1 albums, and Farrell's departure left the group unable to promote it. Following this, the group released a ''Christmas Album''.

Reggie Tsiboe was hired to replace Farrell as the new male member of Boney M. in 1982 but the singles &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot; and &quot;Jambo&quot; fared poorly, and the group's seventh album ''[[Ten Thousand Lightyears]]'', issued in 1984, marked another commercial low point. The group, however, returned to the German Top 20 in the autumn of 1984 with &quot;Kalimba de Luna&quot; and &quot;Happy Song&quot;, the latter seeing Bobby Farrell return to the group. Both songs were carbon-copies of the original Italian hits by [[Tony Esposito (musician)|Tony Esposito]] and [[Baby's Gang]] respectively.

By 1985, Farian clearly began losing interest in the group, and their final studio album ''[[Eye Dance]]'' was widely regarded as uninspired and disappointing. After celebrating Boney M.'s ten-year anniversary in early 1986, the group officially disbanded after the release of the commercially unsuccessful single 'Young, Free and Single'.

From this point, different versions of the group were formed. One version began touring in the first half of 1987 with Marilyn Carrillo taking Liz Mitchell's place. Mitchell returned for a second leg of the tour late 1987, and Marcia Barrett soon left the band again. At the same time, Bobby Farrell had set up a deal for a new Boney M. album to be recorded without Farian in Belgium. When Farrell failed to show up for either recording or tour, and Maizie Williams had never sung on record, the album ended up being released as Liz Mitchell's first solo album ''No One Will Force You''. Mitchell and Williams completed a tour during 1987-88, adding singer Celena Duncan and Curt De Daran as replacements for Barrett and Farrell. Carol Grey later replaced Celena Duncan.

In October 1988, the classic Boney M. line-up reunited for the album ''[[Greatest Hits of All Times - Remix '88]]'' but tensions ran high between the members, and Liz Mitchell left in the spring of 1989 to be replaced by [[Madeleine Davis]]. While Mitchell promoted her solo album, the group recorded the single &quot;Everybody Wants to Dance Like Josephine Baker&quot;, without Farian's knowledge or approval. Threatened with legal action by the producer over the use of the Boney M. name, the single was subsequently withdrawn and Farian issued &quot;Stories&quot; with his own new Boney M. line-up featuring Liz Mitchell, Reggie Tsiboe and two new members, Sharon Stevens and Patty Onoyewenjo. A second remix album ''[[Greatest Hits of All Times - Remix '89 - Volume II]]'' was released but fared poorly.

===The 1990s===
1992 saw a renewed interest in Boney M.'s music with the &quot;Boney M. Megamix&quot; single returning the group to the UK Top 10 for the first time since 1980, and a subsequent Greatest Hits album reaching the UK Top 20 in 1993. While Marcia Barrett, now residing in [[Florida]], was battling [[cancer]] and unable to perform, Boney M. toured the world with a line-up of Liz Mitchell, Carol Grey, Patricia Lorna Foster and Curt Dee Daran (replaced by Tony Ashcroft in 1994). Maizie Williams assembled her own Boney M. line-up with her friend and short-time Boney M. member in the early days in 1975, Sheila Bonnick, and two others. Bobby Farrell also toured with three ever-changing female performers.

=== 2000s ===
[[File:BoneyMwGoleniowie.jpg|right|thumb|Boney M featuring Maizie Williams performing at a concert]]

Liz Mitchell was touring the world with her line-up of Boney M., which is the only line-up officially supported by Farian (the court ruling of 1990 stated that all four members are entitled to perform their own Boney M. shows). Bobby Farrell and Liz Mitchell have released solo albums containing their own re-recordings of Boney M.'s classic hits. Maizie Williams released her first solo album in 2006 and her own single version of Boney M.'s &quot;Sunny&quot;. In 2007 her rendition of 'Daddy Cool' with Melo-M hit the number one spot in the Latvian (LMK) Charts. Marcia Barrett has released two solo albums with a third scheduled for release in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maiziewilliams.com/ Maizie Williams official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

As recounted in his 2004 book ''[[Touching the Void]]'', the British climber [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]] was subsequently to find the catchy tune of &quot;Brown Girl in the Ring&quot; haunting him in the final hours of his struggle to survive the descent of [[Siula Grande]] in the [[Andes]], and the song was later used in the film of ''[[Touching the Void (film)|Touching the Void]]'' made by [[Kevin Macdonald (director)|Kevin Macdonald]]. Simpson recalls: &quot;I remember thinking, bloody hell, I'm going to die to Boney M&quot;.

A [[Musical theatre|musical]] based on the music of Boney M., ''[[Daddy Cool (musical)|Daddy Cool]]'', opened in London in August 2006 to mixed reviews and sluggish ticket sales, causing it to close again in February 2007. From April to July, 2007, this show played in a mobile theatre in Berlin, which was specially designed for this show. 

In April 2007, pop singer [[Peter Wilson (musician)|Peter Wilson]]{{dn}}, who during the mid-90s scored a couple of Top 40 hits in his native Australia, released a brand new song, co-written by [[Frank Farian]] entitled &quot;[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)#&quot;Doin’ Fine&quot;|Doin' Fine]]&quot;. It is described as &quot;paying tribute to the sound of Boney M.&quot; and features the famous string arrangement from their first number 1 hit, &quot;[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]&quot;.

In a sign of their continued popularity in South Asia, a concert by Boney M. (featuring Marcia Barrett) was a featured attraction at the 37th [[International Film Festival of India]] (IFFI), which took place on November 23, 2006 in [[Panaji]], the state capital of [[Goa]], India. The group is also popular in the Vietnamese diaspora, and was featured in Thuy Nga music productions.

In the UK, a new album of their greatest hits, entitled ''[[The Magic of Boney M.]]'' was released via [[BMG]] on November 27, 2006. Special additions to this release were a [[Mousse T.]] remix of &quot;[[Sunny (song)|Sunny]]&quot; and a brand new song from 2006, featuring Liz Mitchell, entitled &quot;A Moment Of Love&quot;.

On April 10, 2007, Boney M.'s first four albums were reissued on [[compact disc]] with bonus tracks, this time also in the United States (the first time these were available to the [[United States|U.S.]] music market since their original releases in the 1970s).

In September 2007, Boney M.'s last four original albums, ''[[Boonoonoonoos]]'', ''[[Ten Thousand Lightyears]], [[Kalimba de Luna - 16 Happy Songs]]'' and ''[[Eye Dance]]'' were reissued on [[compact disc]] in Europe and the United States, all including bonus tracks. In November 2007, a new [[Christmas With Boney M. (2007 Edition)|Christmas compilation]] was scheduled for release as well as the DVD ''[[Fantastic Boney M. - On Stage and on the Road]]'' featuring live performances and a film from the band's 1981 visit to [[Jamaica]].

Bobby Farrell's Boney M. performed a concert at the Amphi in [[Ra'anana]], [[Israel]] in May 2007. On June 28, 2007 Boney M. featuring Matthew Felsenfeld and Liz Mitchell performed at the &quot;Oktiabrsky&quot; concert hall in St. Petersburg, Russia. In September 2007, Maizie Williams Boney M. line-up performed live at the Royal Albert Hall, UK, to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS in Africa, performing her own renditions of 'Brown Girl in the Ring' and 'Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday'.

The legal rights to the name &quot;Boney M.&quot; have been a matter of controversy, and even court cases, between the former members of the band and producer Frank Farian ever since the late 1980s. Farian, the man who in effect created the group, has continued to work with Liz Mitchell and her line-up all through the 1990s and 2000s, but in a strange twist of fate further Boney M. productions in Germany could be faced with legal proceedings. January 2007 was the date Zanillya Farrell (daughter of [[Bobby Farrell]]) and Yasmina Ayad-Saban (ex-wife of Farrell) renewed the trademark to the name Boney M. in Germany for a 10 year period. 

In November 2008, iconic disco legend and former label mate, [[Amanda Lear]] recorded a version of the song, &quot;[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)#&quot;Doin’ Fine&quot;|Doin' Fine]]&quot; as part of her new studio album,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prolificmedia.co.uk ::: PROLIFIC MEDIA GROUP UK ::: Music &amp; Design Studio ::: Music Production | Design | Creative Consultancy | A&amp;R | Publishing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which she announced on French television is scheduled for release in spring 2009.

In January 2009 [[Frank Farian]] released a brand new single called ''Felicidad America (Obama Obama)'' under the name-check ''Boney M. feat. Sherita O. &amp; Yulee B.'' featuring two new vocalists. The song is a remake of the 1980 Boney M. classic with new vocals and re-written lyrics now referring to the new US president [[Barack Obama]].

===2010s===
In July 2010, Maizie Williams headlined a Boney M performance at Ramallah's Cultural Palace, in the West Bank, as part of the Palestine International Festival. The band played &quot;Daddy Cool&quot;, &quot;Ma Baker&quot; and &quot;Brown Girl in the Ring&quot;, but refrained from playing &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot;, rumored to be at the event organizers' request due to its description of the Jewish yearning for Zion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetruthherzl.com/2010/07/despair-and-joy-24-hours-around.html &quot;Despair and Joy: 24 Hours around Jerusalem&quot; on The Truth Herzl]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yuvalbenami.blogspot.com/2010/07/how-shall-we-sing-lords-song-in-strange.html &quot;How Shall we Sing the Lord's Song in a Strange Land?&quot; on Everywhere by Yuval Ben Ami]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jH-40LukweU-pTqtUy8NewItYahQD9H43R900]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 30, 2010, it was announced that Bobby Farrell had died at the age of 61 from [[heart failure]]. His agent said Farrell was complaining of breathing problems after performing with his band the evening before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bobby Farrell (61) overleden | url=http://www.nu.nl/muziek/2412427/bobby-farrell-61-overleden.html | publisher=[[NU.nl]] | date=30 December 2010 | accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Boney M's Bobby Farrell has died, aged 61 | url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2010/1230/farrellb.html | publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTE]] | date=30 December 2010 | accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrell lived in Amsterdam until his death. The singer was found dead in a hotel room in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], where he had been performing. Coincidentally, Farrell died on the anniversary of [[Grigori Rasputin]]'s death, also in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12096781 &quot;Boney M singer Bobby Farrell dies aged 61&quot;, BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK sales mark==
In 1978, &quot;[[Rivers of Babylon]]&quot;, a cover of a track by [[The Melodians]] with lyrics partly based on [[Psalm 137]] and partly on Psalm 19,&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Psalms#Psalm 137|Psalm 137]] in the Bible (King James)&lt;/ref&gt; became (at the time) the second highest-selling single of all time in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. After reaching no.1 for five weeks, &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot; began dropping down the chart, at which point the [[B-side]] &quot;Brown Girl in the Ring&quot; was given extensive radio airplay, and the single climbed back up the chart to #2. The single spent 6 months in the UK Top 40, including 19 weeks in the Top 10. It eventually sold 5000 copies short of two million.

The group achieved a second UK million-seller with their version of the [[calypso music|calypso]] classic &quot;[[Mary's Boy Child]]/Oh My Lord&quot;, which was previously a million-seller for [[Harry Belafonte]]. On the list of the [[List of best-selling singles by year (UK)|all-time best selling singles in the United Kingdom]], Boney M. appear in fifth place (with &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot;) and tenth place (with &quot;Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord&quot;). The single sold almost 1.8 million copies and achieved sales of over 1.6 million in the 4 weeks the song was at number one in December 1978. [[Paul McCartney]] is the only other artist to appear twice (once with [[The Beatles]], once with [[Wings (band)|Wings]]) in the Top 10 of that list.

==Back catalogue==
Compared to other best-selling artists of the 1970s like [[ABBA]], [[Donna Summer]], and the [[Bee Gees]] the Boney M. discography is quite unusual – while the greater part of the band's back catalogue has been remixed, remade, remodeled and reissued all through the 80s, 90s and 2000s by producer Frank Farian and record company [[BMG-Ariola]] (now [[Sony BMG]]), most of the original 7&quot; and 12&quot; versions issued on vinyl in the 70s and early 80s remained unavailable on CD until 2008 and the release of the box set ''[[The Collection (Boney M. Box Set)|The Collection]]'' and the single CD compilation ''[[Rivers Of Babylon (A Best Of Collection)]]''.

==Popularity outside the West==

During the [[South Korean presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential election]] campaign of [[South Korea]], then-candidate [[Roh Moo-hyun]], who eventually won the presidency at that event, took ''Bahama Mama'' to promote his aim of positive political reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDcNm6rA2Vo YouTube - Cheerful Political Reform]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}(Korean), from the official media outlet of Roh Moo-hyun&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 Chinese film ''[[Shanghai Dreams]]'' features a scene depicting a rural Chinese disco in 1983, with teenagers dancing to ''[[Rivers of Babylon]]'' and ''Gotta Go Home''&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=jUKxDVilH8M YouTube - Disco Dance in Chinese Movie &quot;Shanghai Dreams&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 Kazakh film ''[[Tulpan]]'', the tractor driver Boni continually plays a cassette of ''[[Rivers of Babylon]]'', an example of his fascination for all things Western.

In the 2008 Chinese film [[Cheung Gong 7 hou]] (English title: [[CJ7]]), the song &quot;Sunny&quot; is a vital part of the soundtrack.

The song [[Rasputin (song)|&quot;Rasputin&quot;]] appears in the 2010 video game [[Just Dance 2 (video game)|''Just Dance 2'']] for the [[Wii|Nintendo Wii]].

'''''Blade Runner''''' is a 1982 American science fiction film directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and starring [[Harrison Ford]], [[Rutger Hauer]], and [[Sean Young]]. The [[screenplay]], written by [[Hampton Fancher]] and [[David Peoples]], is based on the novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]].

The film depicts a [[dystopia]]n [[Los Angeles]] in November 2019 in which genetically engineered organic robots called [[replicant]]s—visually indistinguishable from adult humans—are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation as well as other mega manufacturers around the world. Their use on Earth is banned, and replicants are exclusively used for dangerous, menial or leisure work on Earth's [[Space colonization|off-world colonies]]. Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and &quot;retired&quot; by police special operatives known as &quot;Blade Runners&quot;. The plot focuses on a brutal and cunning group of recently escaped replicants hiding in Los Angeles and the burnt out expert blade runner, [[Rick Deckard]] (Harrison Ford), who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down.

''Blade Runner'' initially polarized critics: some were displeased with the pacing, while others enjoyed its thematic complexity. The film performed poorly in North American theaters. Despite the box office failure of the film, it has since become a [[cult film|cult classic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Sammon | first= Paul M. | year= 1996 | title= Future Noir: the Making of Blade Runner | isbn = 0-06-105314-7 | location= London | publisher= Orion Media | pages= xvi–xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now widely regarded as one of the [[Blade Runner#Lists of the best films|best movies ever made]].

Seven versions of the film have been shown for various markets as a result of controversial changes made by film executives. A rushed director's cut was released in 1992 after a strong response to workprint screenings. This, in conjunction with its popularity as a video rental, made it one of the first films released on DVD, resulting in a basic disc with mediocre video and audio quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunt&quot;&gt;{{citation|last1 = Hunt | first1 = Bill|date=2007-12-12|url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/reviewshd/bladerunnerfinalallver01.html|title=Blade Runner: The Final Cut&amp;nbsp;– All Versions|publisher=The Digital Bits, Inc|accessdate=2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Warner Bros.]] released in select theaters, and subsequently on DVD, [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc]], the 25th anniversary digitally remastered [[Versions of Blade Runner#The Final Cut (2007)|Final Cut]] by Scott.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedigitalbits&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/br2007/announce.html|title=Blade Runner: The Final Cut|publisher=The Digital Bits, Inc|accessdate=2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
{{Dablink|'''Note''': There are several [[versions of Blade Runner|versions of ''Blade Runner'']].}}
In [[Los Angeles]], November 2019, retired police officer [[Rick Deckard]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) is detained at a noodle bar by officer [[Characters in Blade Runner#Gaff|Gaff]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]). His former supervisor, [[Characters in Blade Runner#Harry Bryant|Bryant]] ([[M. Emmet Walsh]]), tells him that several &quot;[[replicant]]s&quot;—biologically engineered [[humanoid]]s who serve as soldiers and slaves in off-world colonies—have escaped, and have come to Earth illegally. As a &quot;blade runner&quot; while active, Deckard's job was to track down replicants on Earth and &quot;retire&quot; them.

Bryant shows him a video of another blade runner, Holden ([[Morgan Paull]]), administering a [[Voight-Kampff machine|Voight-Kampff test]], which distinguishes humans from replicants based on their  [[empathy|empathic]] response to questions. The subject of the test, [[Characters in Blade Runner#Leon Kowalski|Leon]] ([[Brion James]]), shoots Holden when it is likely he will be exposed as a replicant.

Deckard agrees to track down Leon and three other replicants—[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]] ([[Rutger Hauer]]), [[Characters in Blade Runner#Zhora|Zhora]] ([[Joanna Cassidy]]) and [[Characters in Blade Runner#Pris|Pris]] ([[Daryl Hannah]])—after Bryant threatens him. These replicants—Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 models—have a four-year lifespan as a [[fail-safe]] to prevent them from developing emotions and desire for independence. They may have come to Earth to try to have these lifespans extended.

Deckard is teamed with Gaff and sent to the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the Voight-Kampff test works on Nexus-6 models. While there, Deckard discovers that [[Characters in Blade Runner#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Tyrell's]] ([[Joe Turkel]]) assistant [[Characters in Blade Runner#Rachael|Rachael]] ([[Sean Young]]) is an experimental replicant who believes she is human; Rachael's consciousness has been enhanced with childhood memories from Tyrell's niece. As a result, a more extensive Voight-Kampff test is required to identify her as a replicant.

Roy and Leon enter the eye manufacturing laboratory of [[Characters in Blade Runner#Hannibal Chew|Chew]] ([[James Hong]]); under interrogation, Chew directs them to [[Characters in Blade Runner#J.F. Sebastian|J.F. Sebastian]] ([[William Sanderson]]) as their best chance of meeting Tyrell. Rachael visits Deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity to him, showing him a family photo. She leaves in tears after Deckard tells her that her memories are implants. Pris meets J.F. Sebastian at his apartment in the [[Bradbury Building]] where he lives with his manufactured companions. Deckard finds an image of Zhora in Leon's photos.

Deckard goes to an area of the city where genetically engineered animals are sold to analyze a scale found in Leon's bathroom, learning that it came from a snake made by Abdul Ben Hassan (Ben Astar). Hassan directs Deckard to a strip club where Zhora works. Deckard &quot;retires&quot; Zhora, whose death is witnessed by Leon. Deckard meets with Bryant shortly after and is told to add Rachael to his list of retirements, as she has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation headquarters. Deckard spots Rachael in the crowd but is attacked by Leon. Rachael saves Deckard by killing Leon, and the two return to Deckard's apartment to recover and discuss her future as a fugitive; they share an intimate moment and Rachael abruptly attempts to flee, Deckard prevents Rachael from leaving and compels her to acknowledge their mutual attraction and they passionately kiss.

Roy arrives at Sebastian's apartment and tells Pris they are the only ones left. They gain Sebastian's help after explaining their plight. Roy discovers that Sebastian is suffering from a genetic disorder that accelerates his aging. Under the pretext of Sebastian informing Tyrell of a winning move in a game of [[correspondence chess]] that they are playing, Roy and Sebastian enter Tyrell's penthouse. Roy demands an extension to his lifespan from his maker. Tyrell explains that Tyrell Corporation never found a way to accomplish this. Roy asks absolution for his sins, confessing that he has done &quot;questionable things.&quot; Tyrell dismisses Roy's guilt, praising Roy's advanced design and his accomplishments. He tells Roy to &quot;revel in his time,&quot; to which Roy responds, &quot;Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you into Heaven for.&quot; Roy then holds Tyrell's head in his hands, gives him a kiss, and kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator, with Roy following. Roy rides the elevator down alone, and Sebastian is not seen again.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian's death was never shot because of concerns over too much violence in the film (Sammon, p. 175). In ''The Final Cut,'' Deckard is told by Bryant that Sebastian's body was found as well.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deckard arrives at Sebastian's apartment and is ambushed by Pris. He kills her just as Roy returns. Roy punches through a wall, grabbing Deckard's right arm, and breaks two of his fingers in retaliation for retiring Zhora and Pris. Roy releases Deckard and gives him time to run before he begins hunting him through the [[Bradbury Building]]. The symptoms of Roy's limited lifespan worsen and his right hand begins failing; he jabs a nail through it to regain control. Roy forces Deckard to the roof. As Deckard attempts to escape Roy, he leaps across to another building but falls short and ends up hanging from a rain-slicked girder. As Deckard loses his grip, Roy, having made the same leap effortlessly, seizes his arm and hauls him onto the roof. As Roy's life ends, he delivers a soliloquy on his life: &quot;I've seen things you people wouldn't believe: Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion; I've watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the [[Tannhauser Gate]]. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.&quot;

Gaff arrives and shouts over to Deckard, &quot;It's too bad she won't live; but then again, who does?&quot; Deckard returns to his apartment to find Rachael alive sleeping in his bed. As they leave, Deckard finds an [[origami]] unicorn, a calling card left by Gaff. Depending on the version, the film ends with Deckard and Rachael either leaving the apartment block to an uncertain future or driving through an idyllic pastoral landscape.

=== Spinner ===
[[File:BladeRunner Spinner.jpg|thumb|left|Police spinners flying above the city.]]

'''Spinner''' is the generic term for the fictional flying cars used in the film. A Spinner can be driven as a ground-based vehicle, take off vertically, hover, and cruise using [[jet engine|jet propulsion]] much like the [[VTOL|Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL)]] aircraft currently in use today. They are used extensively by the police to patrol and survey the population, and it is clear that despite restrictions wealthy people can acquire spinner licenses.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was conceived and designed by [[Syd Mead]] and has been &quot;replicated&quot; in subsequent films such as ''[[The Fifth Element]]'' and the ''[[Star Wars]]'' prequel trilogy. These films have the popular vision of flying cars, and people use spinners like traditional cars; in ''Blade Runner'', the flying cars substitute for [[helicopter]]s and [[very light jet]]s.

Designer Mead has described the spinner as an '''aerodyne''' – a vehicle which directs air downward to create [[lift (force)|lift]], though press kits for the film stated that the spinner was propelled by three engines: &quot;conventional [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]], jet and [[anti-gravity]]&quot;.

A Spinner is on permanent exhibit at the [[Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame]] in Seattle, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empsfm.org/documents/press/EMPSFMBrochure.pdf |publisher=Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame |title=EMPSFM Brochure |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voight-Kampff machine ===
{{Quote box
|quote = A very advanced form of lie detector that measures contractions of the iris muscle and the presence of invisible airborne particles emitted from the body. The bellows were designed for the latter function and give the machine the menacing air of a sinister insect.

The '''Voight-Kampff machine''' or device is a fictional interrogation tool originating in the book where it is spelled '''Voigt-Kampff'''. The Voight-Kampff is a [[polygraph]]-like machine used by Blade Runner units to assist in the testing of an individual to see if he or she is a [[replicant]]. It measures bodily functions such as [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], &quot;[[Blushing|blush response]]&quot;, [[heart rate]], and [[Human eye|eye]] movement in response to emotionally provocative questions.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; In the film two replicants take the test: Leon and Rachael. In ''Blade Runner'', Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant. With Rachael it takes more than one hundred. This is in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes &quot;six or seven&quot; questions to make a determination.

== Cast and characters ==
{{Anchor|Cast}}
{{Main|List of Blade Runner characters}}
With the exception of Harrison Ford, ''Blade Runner'' used a number of less well-known actors such as Daryl Hannah and Sean Young.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; The cast includes:

* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Rick Deckard]]. Coming off the success of ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' (1977), ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth. After [[Steven Spielberg]] praised Ford, he was hired for ''Blade Runner''. In 1992, Ford revealed, &quot;''Blade Runner'' is not one of my favorite films. I tangled with Ridley.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the voiceovers: &quot;When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a f**king{{sic}}&lt;!--This is a direct quote, and is correct as written with two asterisks.--&gt; nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration. But now I was stuck re-creating that narration. And I was obliged to do the voiceovers for people that did not represent the director's interests.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

* [[Sean Young]] as Rachael, Tyrell's assistant. Rachael is a replicant with memories that belonged to Tyrell's niece.

* [[Edward James Olmos]] as Gaff. Olmos used his diverse ethnic background, and some in-depth personal research, to help create the fictional &quot;Cityspeak&quot; language his character uses in the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p115&quot;&gt;Sammon, pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; His initial addresses to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and means, &quot;Horse dick! No way. You are the Blade ... Blade Runner.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p115&quot; /&gt;

* [[Daryl Hannah]] as Pris, a &quot;basic pleasure model&quot;. The development of her relationship with Roy Batty is shown as a symbol of the replicants' underlying humanity.

* [[M. Emmet Walsh]] as Captain Bryant. Walsh lived up to his reputation as a great character actor with the role of a hard-drinking, sleazy and underhanded police veteran typical of the [[film noir]] genre.

* [[Joe Turkel]] as Dr. Eldon Tyrell, a corporate mogul who has built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid [[slavery|slaves]].

* [[William Sanderson]] as J. F. Sebastian, a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity. J.&amp;nbsp;F. is able to sympathize with the replicants' short lifespan because he has &quot;[[Methuselah]] Syndrome&quot; (possibly a form of [[progeria]]), a genetic disease that causes faster aging and a short lifespan.

* [[Brion James]] as Leon Kowalski, a replicant masquerading as a waste disposal engineer; he shoots a Blade Runner to escape, establishing the physical threat the replicants pose to their would-be captors.

* [[Joanna Cassidy]] as Zhora, a special-ops, undercover and assassin model. Cassidy portrays a strong female replicant who has seen the worst humanity has to offer.

* [[Morgan Paull]] as Holden, the Blade Runner initially assigned to the case. He is shot by Leon while screening new Tyrell employees in an attempt to find the replicants, prompting his replacement with Deckard.

* [[James Hong]] as Hannibal Chew, an elderly Asian geneticist specializing in synthetic eyes.

* [[Hy Pyke]] as Taffey Lewis. Pyke conveyed Lewis's sleaziness with ease and in a single [[take]], something almost unheard-of with Scott, whose drive for perfection resulted at times in double-digit takes.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
[[File:Bradbury building Los Angeles c2005 01403u.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Bradbury Building]] in Los Angeles was a filming location.]]
{{Anchor|Writing|Development}}
Interest in adapting [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' developed shortly after its 1968 publication. According to Dick, director [[Martin Scorsese]] was interested in filming the novel, but never [[option (finance)|optioned]] it.&lt;ref name=&quot;PKDonBR&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = James Van Hise | title = Philip K. Dick on Blade Runner| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080503175717/www.philipkdickfans.com/pkdweb/DO+ANDROIDS+DREAM.htm | archivedate = 2008-05-03 | work = Starlog }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick wasn't impressed with the screenplay: &quot;Robert Jaffe, who wrote the screenplay, flew down here to Orange County. I said to him then that it was so bad that I wanted to know if he wanted me to beat him up there at the airport or wait till we got to my apartment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PKDonBR&quot; /&gt;
The [[screenplay]] by [[Hampton Fancher]]&lt;!--Not entitled &quot;Android&quot; initially&amp;nbsp;– See Sammon, pp. 32 and 38 for explanation--&gt; was optioned in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 23–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer [[Michael Deeley]] became interested in Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to use it to create his first American film. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'', wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 43–49.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised financing from [[Filmways]] from $13&amp;nbsp;million to $15&amp;nbsp;million. Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and faith, which weighed heavily in the novel. Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by [[William S. Burroughs]] for [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s novel ''[[The Bladerunner]]'' (1974), entitled ''[[Blade Runner (a movie)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Some editions of Nourse's novel use the two-word spacing ''Blade Runner'', as does the Burroughs book.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained the rights to the titles. Eventually he hired [[David Peoples]] to rewrite the script, and Fancher left the job on December 21, 1980, over the issue, although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 49–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having invested over $2.5&amp;nbsp;million in pre-production,&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; as the date of commencement of principal photography neared, Filmways withdrew financial backing. In ten days, Deeley secured $21.5&amp;nbsp;million in financing through a three way deal between [[The Ladd Company]] (through Warner Bros.), the [[Hong Kong]]-based producer [[Run Run Shaw|Sir Run Run Shaw]], and [[Tandem Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 18–19 and Sammon, pp. 64–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip K. Dick]] became concerned that no one had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; After Dick criticized an early version of Hampton Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles ''Select TV Guide'', the studio sent Dick the David Peoples rewrite.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script, and with a twenty-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Dick enthused after the screening to Ridley Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it.&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p284&quot;&gt;Sammon, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; The motion picture was dedicated to Dick.&lt;ref&gt;Blade Runner film, dedication after credits, 1:51:30&lt;/ref&gt;

''Blade Runner'' has numerous and deep similarities to [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]'', including a built up urban environment, in which the wealthy literally live above the workers, dominated by a huge building—the Stadtkrone Tower in ''Metropolis'' and the Tyrell Building in ''Blade Runner''. Special effects supervisor David Dryer used stills from ''Metropolis'' when lining up ''Blade Runner'''s miniature building shots.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 61–63 and Sammon, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ridley Scott credits [[Edward Hopper]]'s painting ''[[Nighthawks]]'' and the French science fiction comic magazine ''[[Métal Hurlant]]'' ([[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]), to which the artist [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]] contributed, as stylistic mood sources.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; He also drew on the landscape of &quot;Hong Kong on a very bad day&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Wheale |first= Nigel |year= 1995 |title= The Postmodern Arts: An Introductory Reader |publisher= Routledge |url= http://books.google.com/?id=8dGfKmubQIgC&amp;pg=PA107 |page= 107 |isbn= 0-415-07776-1 |accessdate= 2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the industrial landscape of his one-time home in the North East of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/09/20/bfscott20.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2003/09/20/ixartright.html|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|title=Director Maximus|accessdate=2008-04-25|date=2003-09-20 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Monahan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott hired as his conceptual artist [[Syd Mead]], who, like Scott, was influenced by ''Métal Hurlant''.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Moebius was offered the opportunity to assist in the pre-production of ''Blade Runner'', but he declined so that he could work on [[Rene Laloux|René Laloux's]] animated film ''[[Les Maîtres du temps]]'', a decision he later regretted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Giraud | first1 = Jean | year = 1988 | title = The Long Tomorrow &amp; Other SF Stories | isbn=0-87135-281-8 | page = {{Page needed|date=October 2010}} | publisher=Marvel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence G. Paull (production designer) and [[David Snyder]] (art director) realized Scott's and Mead's sketches. [[Douglas Trumbull]] and Richard Yuricich supervised the [[special effects]] for the film. Principal photography of ''Blade Runner'' began on March 9, 1981, and ended four months later.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Casting ==
Casting the film proved troublesome, particularly for the lead role of Deckard. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned [[Robert Mitchum]] as Deckard, and wrote the character's dialogue with Mitchum in mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner|medium=Blade Runner: The Final Cut DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director Ridley Scott and the film's producers &quot;spent months&quot; meeting and discussing the role with [[Dustin Hoffman]], who eventually departed over differences in vision.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons, including his performance in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, Ford's interest in the story of ''Blade Runner'', and discussions with [[Steven Spielberg]], who was finishing ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' at the time and strongly praised Ford's work in the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; According to production documents, a long list of actors were considered for the role, including, but not limited to, [[Gene Hackman]], [[Sean Connery]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Al Pacino]], and [[Burt Reynolds]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt;

Casting the roles of Rachael and Pris was also challenging; a lengthy series of screen tests were filmed with numerous actresses auditioning for the roles. [[Morgan Paull]], who played the role of Deckard during the screen tests with actresses auditioning for the role of Rachael and Pris, was cast as Deckard's fellow bounty hunter Holden based on his performances in the tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; Among the actresses tested for the role of Rachael was blonde [[Nina Axelrod]], who was Paull's recommendation.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; [[Stacey Nelkin]] tried out for Pris, but was instead given another role in the film, which was ultimately cut before filming.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; Both Axelrod's and Nelkin's screen tests are featured in the 2007 documentary ''Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner''.

One role that was not difficult to cast was Roy Batty: Ridley Scott cast Rutger Hauer without having met him, based solely on Hauer's performances in other films Scott had seen.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; [[Joe Pantoliano]], who later played the role of Cypher in ''[[The Matrix]]'', was considered for the role of Sebastian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, Ridley Scott was asked &quot;Who's the biggest pain in the arse you've ever worked with?&quot; He replied: &quot;It's got to be Harrison&amp;nbsp;... he'll forgive me because now I get on with him. Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When we worked together it was my first film up and I was the new kid on the block.

I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=In Conversation with Harrison Ford|journal=Empire|date=April 2006|first=|last=|issue=202|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of ''[[Total Film]]'' that [[Harrison Ford]] contributed to the ''Blade Runner'' Special Edition [[DVD]], having already done his interviews. &quot;Harrison's fully on board&quot;, said Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Smith|first=Neil | title=The Total Film Interview | newspaper=Total Film | date=Summer 2007 | issue=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
{{Main|Themes in Blade Runner}}
Although ''Blade Runner'' is ostensibly an action film, it operates on multiple dramatic and narrative levels; it is indebted to [[film noir]] conventions: the [[femme fatale]], protagonist-narration (removed in later versions), dark and shadowy [[cinematography]], and the questionable moral outlook of the [[hero]]—in this case, extended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last= Barlow |first= Aaron |contribution= Reel Toads and Imaginary Cities: Philip K.

[[File:BladeRunner Sun.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. Tyrell polarizing his office window to control the [[Sun]] implies the god-like powers of the Tyrell Corporation.]]

''Blade Runner'' delves into the implications of [[technology]] for the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and society by reaching to the past, using literature, [[religious symbolism]], classical dramatic themes, and [[film noir]]. This tension between past, present, and future is mirrored in the retrofitted future of ''Blade Runner'', which is [[high tech|high-tech]] and gleaming in places but decayed and old elsewhere. Interviewing Ridley Scott in 2002, reporter [[Lynn Barber]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' described the film as: &quot;extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel&quot;. Director Scott said he &quot;liked the idea of exploring pain&quot; in the wake of his brother's skin cancer death. &quot;When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scottobserver&quot; /&gt;

An aura of [[paranoia]] suffuses the film. [[Corporation|Corporate]] power looms large, the police seem omnipresent, vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings, and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored—especially the consequences for replicants of their implanted memories. Control over the environment is depicted as taking place on a vast scale, hand in hand with the absence of any natural life, with artificial animals substituting for their extinct templates. This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to extra-terrestrial (&quot;off-world&quot;) colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1= Leaver |first1 = Tama |year= 1997 |title= Post-Humanism and Ecocide in William Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' and Ridley Scott's ''Blade Runner'' | url= http://scribble.com/uwi/br/br-eco.html | publisher = Tama Leaver, University of Western Australia | accessdate = 2008-02-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071222020342/http://scribble.com/uwi/br/br-eco.html |archivedate = 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The dystopian themes explored in ''Blade Runner'' are an early example of [[cyberpunk]] concepts expanding into film. Eyes are a recurring motif, as are manipulated images, calling into question reality and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1= Saini | first1 = Tinku |year= 1996 |url= http://scribble.com/uwi/br/tinku/ |title=Eye disbelieve |publisher= Tinku Saini, University of Washington |accessdate= 2008-01-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071227024439/http://scribble.com/uwi/br/tinku/ |archivedate = 2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=McCoy |first1 = John|url= http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~syverson/309-fall95/classpage/bladerunner/mccoy/|title=The Eyes Tell All|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=2008-02-01|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

These thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for ''Blade Runner'''s central theme of examining humanity. In order to discover replicants, an empathy test is used, with a number of its questions focused on the treatment of animals—it seems to be an essential indicator of someone's &quot;humanity&quot;. The replicants are juxtaposed with human characters who lack empathy, while the replicants appear to show compassion and concern for one another at the same time as the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal. The film goes so far as to put in doubt whether Deckard is a human, and forces the audience to reevaluate what it means to be human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kerman | first1 = Judith | year = 1991 | title = Retrofitting ''Blade Runner'': Issues in Ridley Scott's ''Blade Runner'' and Philip K.

The question of whether Deckard is intended to be a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the film's release.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Michael Deeley and Harrison Ford wanted Deckard to be human while Hampton Fancher preferred ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Ridley Scott has confirmed that in his vision Deckard is a replicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Peary | first1 = Danny |year= 1984 |title= Omni's Screen Flights/Screen Fantasies: The Future According to Science Fiction |chapter= Directing ''Alien'' and ''Blade Runner'': An Interview with Ridley Scott |publisher= Dolphin |location= Garden City |pages= 293–302 |isbn= 0-385-19202-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytkaplan&quot;&gt;{{Citation

He was always a replicant.'&quot;
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Deckard's [[unicorn]] dream sequence inserted into the Director's Cut coinciding with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn is seen by many as showing Deckard is a replicant as Gaff could have access to Deckard's implanted memories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alessio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/825641.stm|title=''Blade Runner'' riddle solved|date=2000-07-09|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognise their affinity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Brooker |first= Peter |contribution= Imagining the Real: ''Blade Runner'' and Discourses on the Postmetropolis |year= 2005 |title= The ''Blade Runner'' Experience |editor-last= Brooker |editor-first= Will |pages= 9, 222 |publisher= Wallflower |place= London |isbn= 1-904764-30-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The inherent ambiguity and uncertainty of the film, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from their own perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Hills |first= Matt |contribution= Academic Textual Poachers: ''Blade Runner'' as Cult Canonical Film |year= 2005 |title= The ''Blade Runner'' Experience |editor-last= Brooker |editor-first= Will |pages= 124–141 |publisher= Wallflower |place= London |isbn = 1-904764-30-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adapting the novel ==
Philip K. Dick refused an offer of $400,000 to write a [[novelization]] of the ''Blade Runner'' screenplay, saying: &quot;[I was] told the cheapo novelization would have to appeal to the twelve-year-old audience&quot; and &quot;[it] would have probably been disastrous to me artistically.&quot; He added, &quot;That insistence on my part of bringing out the original novel and not doing the novelization—they were just furious. They finally recognized that there was a legitimate reason for reissuing the novel, even though it cost them money. It was a victory not just of contractual obligations but of theoretical principles.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dick's final interview&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Boonstra|first=John|title=A final interview with science fiction's boldest visionary, who talks candidly about ''Blade Runner'', inner voices and the temptations of Hollywood|journal=Rod Serling's the Twilight Zone Magazine|volume=2|issue=3|date=June 1982|pages=47–52|url=http://www.philipkdick.com/media_twilightzone.html|accessdate=2008-02-06}} (Available from the Philip K. Dick Trust)&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' was reprinted as a [[movie tie-in (book)|tie-in]], with the film poster as a cover and the original title in parentheses below the ''Blade Runner'' title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=n0pzCsR6yDQC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Blade runner: (Do androids dream of electric sheep)|last=Dick|first=Philip K.|year=2007|publisher=Del Rey Books|page=216|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The producers of the film arranged for a screening of some special effects rough cuts for Philip K. Dick shortly before he died in early 1982. Despite his well known skepticism of [[Hollywood]] in principle, he became quite enthusiastic about the film. He said, &quot;I saw a segment of Douglas Trumbull's special effects for ''Blade Runner'' on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly.&quot; He also approved of the film's script, saying, &quot;After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other, so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dick's final interview&quot; /&gt;

== Reception ==
''Blade Runner'' was released in 1,290 theaters on June 25, 1982. That date was chosen by producer [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] because his previous highest-grossing films (''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'') had a similar opening date (May 25) in 1977 and 1979, making the date his &quot;lucky day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;
The gross for the opening weekend was a disappointing $6.15 million.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, p. 34 and Sammon, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant factor in the film's rather poor box office performance was that its release coincided with other science fiction film releases, including ''[[The Thing (film)|The Thing]]'', ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', and, most significantly, ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which dominated box office revenues that summer.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 316–317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critics were polarized as some felt the story had taken a back seat to special effects and that it was not the action/adventure the studio had advertised. Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would stand the test of time.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 313–315.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a general criticism was its slow pacing that detracts from other strengths;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Hicks|first1=Chris|date=1992-09-11|url= http://deseretnews.com/movies/view/0,1257,200,00.html |title=deseretnews.com Movie review: Blade Runner |publisher=Deseret News Publishing Co|accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheila Benson from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it &quot;Blade crawler&quot;, while Pat Berman in State and Columbia Record described it as &quot;[[science fiction]] [[pornography]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sammon, p. 313 and p. 314, respectively&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] praised both the original and the ''Director's cut'' version of ''Blade Runner''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s visuals and recommended it for that reason; however, he found the human story clichéd and a little thin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebert&quot; /&gt; In 2007, upon release of ''The Final Cut'', Roger Ebert somewhat revised his original opinion of the film and added it to his list of Great Movies, while noting, &quot;I have been assured that my problems in the past with ''Blade Runner'' represent a failure of my own taste and imagination, but if the film was perfect, why has Sir Ridley continued to tinker with it?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071103%2FREVIEWS08%2F71103001%2F1023|date= 2007-11-03|title= Blade Runner: The Final Cut (1982)|authorlink= Roger Ebert | last1 = Ebert | first1 = Roger |accessdate= 2007-11-23 |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BladeRunner Spinner Billboard.jpg|thumb|A police [[Spinner (Blade Runner)|spinner]] flying beside huge advertising-laden skyscrapers. These [[special effects]] are benchmarks that have influenced many subsequent science-fiction films.]]

While not initially a success with North American audiences, the film was popular internationally and became a [[cult film]].&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 318–329.&lt;/ref&gt; The film's dark style and futuristic design have served as a benchmark and its influence can be seen in many subsequent science fiction films, [[anime]], video games, and television programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot; /&gt; For example, [[Ronald D. Moore]] and [[David Eick]], the producers of the re-imagining of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', have both cited ''Blade Runner'' as one of the major influences for the show. ''Blade Runner'' continues to reflect modern trends and concerns, and an increasing number consider it one of the greatest science fiction films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Jha |first1=Alok |last2=Rogers |first2=Simon |last3=Rutherford |first3=Adam |date=2004-08-26 |accessdate=2006-11-14| url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/feature/story/0,13026,1290561,00.html| title= Our expert panel votes for the top 10 sci-fi films| work= Guardian Unlimited| publisher= Guardian News and Media Limited| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blade Runner'' is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' film series, which itself has been highly influential to the future-noir genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence |first=Jim |last=Omura |date=2004-09-16 |journal=FPS Magazine |url=http://www.fpsmagazine.com/review/040916innocence.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Hollywood is haunted by Ghost in the Shell |first=Steve |last=Rose |journal=guardian.co.uk |date=2009-10-19 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/oct/19/hollywood-ghost-in-the-shell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Blade Runner'' curse===
Among the [[folklore]] that has developed around the film over the years has been the belief that the film was a curse to the companies whose logos were displayed prominently as [[product placement]]s in some scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; While they were market leaders at the time, more than half experienced disastrous setbacks during the next decade. [[RCA]], which at one time was the United States' leading consumer electronics and communications conglomerate, was bought out by one-time parent [[General Electric]] in 1985, and dismantled. [[Atari]], which dominated the [[video game console|home video game]] market when the film came out, never recovered from [[video game crash of 1983|the next year's downturn]] in the industry, and by the 1990s had ceased to represent anything more than a brand, a [[wikt:back catalogue|back catalogue]] of games and some [[legacy computer]]s. Atari today is an entirely different firm, using the former company's name. [[Cuisinart]] similarly went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] in 1989, though it lives on under new ownership. The [[Bell System]] monopoly was broken up that same year, and most of the resulting [[Regional Bell operating companies]] have since changed their names and merged back with each other and other companies to form the new [[AT&amp;T]]. [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] suffered from the terrorist bombing/destruction of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] and after a decade of mounting losses, finally went bankrupt in 1991 with the falloff in overseas travel caused by the Gulf War. [[The Coca-Cola Company]] suffered losses during its failed introduction of [[New Coke]] in 1985, but soon afterward regained its market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Chapman | first1 = Murray | year = 1992–1998 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080623083910/http://scribble.com/uwi/br/brfaq/faq-curse.html | archivedate = 2008-06-23 | title = The ''Blade Runner'' Curse | publisher = University of Queensland | accessdate = 2008-01-30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Future Noir''===
{{See|Tech noir}}
Before the film's [[principal photography]] began, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' magazine commissioned Paul M. Sammon to write an article about ''Blade Runner'''s production, which became the book ''Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner'' (referred to as the &quot;''Blade Runner'' Bible&quot; by many of the film's fans).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.brmovie.com/Encyclopedia/PQRST.HTML |title= BRmovie.com: Encyclopedia Blade Runner|accessdate=2008-01-22 |publisher= BRmovie.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080316193547/http://www.brmovie.com/Encyclopedia/PQRST.HTML |archivedate = 2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book chronicles the evolution of ''Blade Runner'' as a film, and focuses on film-set politics, especially the British director's experiences with his first American film crew, of which producer [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] has said, &quot;Harrison wouldn't speak to Ridley and Ridley wouldn't speak to Harrison. By the end of the shoot Ford was 'ready to kill Ridley', said one colleague. He really would have taken him on if he hadn't been talked out of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Shone | first= Tom | year= 2004 | title= Blockbuster | isbn = 0-7432-3990-3 | publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Future Noir'' has short cast biographies and quotations about their experiences in making ''Blade Runner'', as well as many photographs of the film's production, and preliminary sketches. The cast chapter was deleted from the first edition; it is available online. A second edition of ''Future Noir'' was published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://scribble.com/uwi/br/fn/ | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20010624131853/scribble.com/uwi/br/fn/ | archivedate  = 2001-06-24 | title= Future Noir: Lost Chapters |publisher= 2019:Lost Worlds |accessdate= 2008-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|Blade Runner (soundtrack)}}

The ''Blade Runner'' soundtrack by [[Vangelis]] is a dark melodic combination of classic composition and futuristic synthesizers which mirrors the film-noir retro-future envisioned by Ridley Scott. Vangelis, fresh from his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning score for ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/sections/br/br01.htm &quot;Blade Runner - Scoring the music&quot;], NemoStudios.co.uk. Retrieved 2010-04-27.&lt;/ref&gt; composed and performed the music on his [[synthesizer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 271–274.&lt;/ref&gt; He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator [[Demis Roussos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p419&quot;&gt;Sammon, pp. 419–423.&lt;/ref&gt; Another memorable sound is the haunting tenor sax solo &quot;Love Theme&quot; by British saxophonist [[Dick Morrissey]], who appeared on many of Vangelis' albums. Ridley Scott also used &quot;Memories of Green&quot; from Vangelis' album ''[[See You Later]]'' (an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film ''[[Someone to Watch Over Me (film)|Someone To Watch Over Me]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Larsen | first = Peter | title = Film music | publisher = Reaktion Books | location = London | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781861893413 |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Vangelis' compositions and ambient textures, the film's sound scape also features a track by the Japanese Ensemble Nipponia ('Ogi No Mato' or 'The Folding Fan as a Target' from the Nonesuch Records release &quot;Traditional Vocal And Instrumental Music&quot;) and a track by harpist Gail Laughton (&quot;Harps of the Ancient Temples&quot; from Laurel Records).&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe]] as best original score, and the promise of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from ''Blade Runner''. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would in 1989 surface on the compilation ''Vangelis: Themes'', but not until the 1992 release of the Director's Cut version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p419&quot; /&gt;

These delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many [[bootleg recording]]s over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 &quot;Off World Music, Ltd.&quot; created a bootleg [[compact disc|CD]] that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis' official CD in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p419&quot; /&gt; A set with three CDs of ''Blade Runner''-related Vangelis music was released on December 10, 2007. Titled ''Blade Runner Trilogy'', the first CD contains the same tracks as the 1994 official soundtrack release, the second CD contains previously unreleased music from the movie, and the third CD is all newly composed music from Vangelis, inspired by, and in the spirit of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/ |title=Album Review: Vangelis: ''Blade Runner Trilogy: 25th Anniversary'' |first=Mike |last=Orme |publisher=[[Pitchfork]] |accessdate=May 16, 2011 |date=February 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
{{Main|Versions of Blade Runner}}

Seven different versions of ''Blade Runner'' have been shown:

* Original '''workprint version''' (1982, 113 minutes) shown to audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. It was also seen in 1990 and 1991 in Los Angeles and San Francisco as a ''Director's Cut'' without Scott's approval. Negative responses to the test previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Kaplan|first1=Fred|title=A Cult Classic, Restored Again |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/movies/30kapl.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=2007-09-30|accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; while positive response to the showings in 1990 and 1991 pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; It was re-released with the 5-disc Ultimate Edition in 2007.

* A '''San Diego Sneak Preview''' shown only once in May 1982, which was almost identical to the ''Domestic Cut'' with three extra scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 306 and 309–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The '''U.S. theatrical version''' (1982, 116 minutes), known as the original version or ''Domestic Cut'', released on [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]] in 1983 and [[laserdisc]] in 1987.

* The '''International Cut''' (1982, 117 minutes) also known as the &quot;Criterion Edition&quot; or uncut version, included more violent action scenes than the U.S. theatrical version. Although initially unavailable in the U.S. and distributed in Europe and Asia via theatrical and local Warner Home Video laserdisc releases, it was later released on [[VHS]] and [[Criterion Collection]] laserdisc in North America, and re-released in 1992 as a &quot;10th Anniversary Edition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 326–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The '''U.S. broadcast version''' (1986, 114 minutes), the U.S. theatrical version edited for violence, [[profanity]] and [[nudity]] by [[CBS]] to meet broadcast restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 407–408 and 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Ridley Scott-approved (1991, 116 minutes) '''Director's Cut'''; prompted by the unauthorized 1990&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1 workprint theatrical release; screened at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theater in September and October 1991, and made available on VHS and laserdisc in 1993, and on DVD in 1997. Significant changes from the theatrical version include removal of Deckard's voice-over, re-insertion of a unicorn sequence and removal of the studio-imposed happy ending. Ridley did provide extensive notes and consultation to Warner Bros. through film preservationist Michael Arick who was put in charge of creating the Director's Cut.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sammon, pp. 353, 365&quot;&gt;Sammon, pp. 353, 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ridley Scott's '''Final Cut''' (2007, 117 minutes), or the &quot;25th Anniversary Edition&quot;, released by Warner Bros. theatrically on October 5, 2007, and subsequently released on DVD, [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc]] in December 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedigitalbits&quot; /&gt; This is the only version over which Ridley Scott had complete artistic control as he was not directly in charge of the ''Director's Cut''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sammon, pp. 353, 365&quot; /&gt; In conjunction with the ''Final Cut'', extensive documentary and other materials were produced for the home video releases culminating in a five-disc &quot;Ultimate Collector's Edition&quot; release by [[Charles de Lauzirika]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hunt&quot; /&gt; A single disc Blu-ray and DVD of the final cut were released in 2010. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=5596&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentaries===

'''''On the Edge of Blade Runner''''' (2000, 55 minutes) was produced by Nobles Gate Ltd. (for [[Channel 4]]), was directed by Andrew Abbott and hosted/written by [[Mark Kermode]]. Interviews with production staff, including Scott, give details of the creative process and the turmoil during preproduction. Stories from Paul M. Sammon and Hampton Fancher provide insight into [[Philip K. Dick]] and the origins of ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;edge-doc-review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tyrell-corporation.pp.se/on-the-edge-of-blade-runner-documentury/|title=On The Edge Of Blade Runner (Documentury) |last=Ingels|first=Nicklas|publisher=Los Angeles, 2019|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interwoven are cast interviews (with the notable exceptions of Harrison Ford and Sean Young), which convey some of the difficulties of making the film (including an exacting director and humid, smoggy weather). There is also a tour of some locations, most notably the [[Bradbury Building]] and the Warner Bros. backlot that became the LA 2019 streets, which look very different from Scott's dark vision. The documentary then details the test screenings and the resulting changes (the voice over, the happy ending, and the deleted Holden hospital scene), the special effects, the soundtrack by Vangelis, and the unhappy relationship between the filmmakers and the investors which culminated in Deeley and Scott being fired but still working on the film. The question of whether or not [[Themes in Blade Runner#Deckard: human or replicant?|Deckard]] is a replicant surfaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;edge-doc-review&quot;/&gt;

'''''Future Shocks''''' (2003, 27 minutes) is a more recent documentary from 2003 by [[TVOntario]] (part of their ''Film 101'' series using footage compiled over the years for [[Saturday Night at the Movies]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;futureshocks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvo.org/TVO/WebObjects/TVO.woa?b?8595181114711207000|title=The Interviews - Future Shocks|publisher=TVO.ORG|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes interviews with executive producer [[Bud Yorkin]], [[Syd Mead]], and the cast, this time with Sean Young, but still without Harrison Ford. There is extensive commentary by science fiction author [[Robert J. Sawyer]] and from film critics, as the documentary focuses on the themes, visual impact and influence of the film. Edward James Olmos describes Ford's participation, and personal experiences during filming are related by Young, Walsh, Cassidy and Sanderson. They also relate a story about crew members creating T-shirts that took pot shots at Scott. The different versions of the film are critiqued and the accuracy of its predictions of the future are discussed.

'''''Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner''''' (2007, 183 minutes) is an approximately three and a half hour long documentary directed and produced by [[Charles de Lauzirika]] for the 2007 Final Cut version of the film. It appears with every edition of ''The Final Cut'' on DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc, except for the 2010 single-disc DVD and Blu-Ray editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=5596 |title=Blade Runner Single-disc Blu-ray Announced

It was culled from over 80 interviews, including Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos, Jerry Perenchio, Bud Yorkin and Ridley Scott, and also contains several alternate and deleted shots within the context of the documentary itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://chud.com/articles/articles/11285/1/INTERVIEW-CHARLES-DE-LAUZIRIKA-BLADE-RUNNER/Page1.html |title=Interview: Charles de Lauzirika (Blade Runner)|accessdate=2008-01-29|publisher=CHUD.com| last1 =Fischer | first1 = Russ|date=2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mil/features/video_real_deal_2/index.html|title=Exclusive: The Real Deal: Digital film restoration and a final cut reveal the true Blade Runner|accessdate=2008-01-29|publisher=Penton Media Inc| last1 = Greer | first1 = Darroch |date= 2007-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary consists of eight chapters, each covering a portion of the film-making—or in the case of the final chapter, the film's controversial legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.filmedge.net/BladeRunner/BRdvd.htm|title=Blade Runner&amp;nbsp;– The Final Cut: 2-Disc Special Edition DVD Review|accessdate=2008-01-29|publisher=FilmEdge.net| last1=Weitz | first1 = Scott|date=2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''All Our Variant Futures: From Workprint to Final Cut''''' (2007, 29 minutes), produced by Paul Prischman, appears on Disc 5 of the ''Blade Runner'' Ultimate Collector's Edition and provides an overview of the film's multiple versions and their origins, as well as detailing the seven year-long restoration, enhancement and remastering process behind ''The Final Cut''. Included are interviews with director Ridley Scott, restoration producer Charles de Lauzirika, restoration consultant Kurt P. Galvao, restoration VFX supervisor John Scheele and ''Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner'' author Paul M. Sammon. Behind-the-scenes footage documenting the restoration—from archival work done in 2001 through the 2007 filming of Joanna Cassidy and Benjamin Ford for ''The Final Cut''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s digital fixes—are seen throughout.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedigitalbits&quot; /&gt; A variety of other supplemental featurettes produced and directed by Charles de Lauzirika are included both the four- and five-disc collector's editions of ''Blade Runner'' released by Warner Home Video in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedigitalbits&quot; /&gt;

===Sequels===
[[K. W. Jeter]], a friend of Philip K. Dick, has written three official, authorized ''Blade Runner'' novels that continue Deckard's story, attempting to resolve many differences between ''Blade Runner'' and ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Gray | first=Christy | contribution=Originals and Copies:The Fans of Philip K.

* ''[[Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human]]'' (1995)
* ''[[Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night]]'' (1996)
* ''[[Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon]]'' (2000)

Ridley Scott apparently toyed with the idea of a sequel film, which would have been titled ''Metropolis''. The project was ultimately shelved due to rights issues. A script was also written for a proposed sequel titled ''Blade Runner Down'', which would have been based on Jeter's first sequel novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://brmovie.com/FAQs/BR_FAQ_BR_2.htm | title=The Blade Runner FAQ: Are there any sequels?

His colleague John Glenn, who left the film by 2008, stated the script explores the nature of the off-world colonies as well as what happens to the Tyrell Corporation in the wake of its founder's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Peter Sciretta | title=Exclusive: Screenwriter Travis Wright Responds to Blade Runner 2 Story | work=/Film | date=2008-10-06 | url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/10/06/exclusive-screenwriter-travis-wright-responds-to-blade-runner-2-story/ | accessdate=2008-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Blade Runner'' co-author [[David Peoples]] wrote the 1998 action film ''[[Soldier (film)|Soldier]]'', which was referred to by him as a &quot;[[sidequel]]&quot;/[[spiritual successor]] to the original film.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cinescape]]'', September/October 1998 issue&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prequel===
In June 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Ridley Scott, together with his brother [[Tony Scott]], was working on a prequel to ''Blade Runner''. The prequel, ''Purefold'', will be a series of 5–10 minute shorts, aimed first at the [[webisode|web]] and then perhaps television, and will be set at a point in time before 2019. Due to rights issues, the series will not be linked too closely to the characters or events of the 1982 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Stone |first=Brad |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/web-series-tied-to-blade-runner-is-in-the-works |title=Web Series Tied to 'Blade Runner' Is In the Works&amp;nbsp;– Bits Blog&amp;nbsp;– NYTimes.com |publisher=Bits.blogs.nytimes.com |date= 2009-06-04|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 2011, [[io9]] reported that Bud Yorkin, the producer of ''Blade Runner'', is now developing a sequel/prequel to the film. It was not announced whether this is connected to Ridley Scott or any of the other original filmmakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/#!5774950/a-warner-bros+financed-production-company-buying-the-rights-to-do-a-blade-runner-sequel-or-prequel |work=[[io9]] |publisher=Gawker Media |accessdate=May 15, 2011 |date=March 4, 2011 |first=Charlie Jane |last=Anders |title=''Blade Runner'' Sequel (or Prequel) in Development Now}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is reported that [[Christopher Nolan]], who has worked with Warner Bros. many times in the past, is wanted at the helm of any eventual prequel or sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=50 Like15 Dislike8 Mar 4, 2011 by B.

===Comics===
[[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] scripted the comic book adaptation, ''[[A Marvel Comics Super Special: Blade Runner]]'', published September 1982. The [[Jim Steranko]] cover leads into a 45-page adaptation illustrated by the team of [[Al Williamson]], Carlos Garzon, Dan Green and [[Ralph Reese]]. This adaptation includes one possible explanation of the title's significance in story context: the narrative line, &quot;Blade runner. You're always movin' on the edge&quot;.

In 2009, BOOM! Studios published a 24-issue miniseries comic book adaptation of the ''Blade Runner'' source novel, ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://philipkdick.com/media_pr-040709.html |title=Philip K.

Studios announced a follow up comic was in production.  ''Dust To Dust'' will be a four issue miniseries starting on May 26, 2010 and will be written by Chris Robertson and drawn by Robert Adler.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/comics/news/a217360/boom-expands-on-blade-runner-universe.html?rss |title=Comics - News - BOOM! expands on 'Blade Runner' universe |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
{{Main|Blade Runner (1985 video game)|Blade Runner (1997 video game)}}
There are two [[video game]]s based on the film, one for [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] (1985) by CRL Group PLC based on the music by Vangelis (due to licensing issues), and another action adventure [[Blade Runner (1997 video game)|PC game]] (1997) by [[Westwood Studios]]. The [[Blade Runner (1997 video game)|Westwood PC game]] featured new characters and branching storylines based on the ''Blade Runner'' world. [[Blade Runner (1997 video game)#Characters|Eldon Tyrell, Gaff, Leon, Rachael, Chew, and J.F. Sebastian]] are seen, and their voice files were recorded by the original actors. DNA Row, the Eye Works, the Police Headquarters, Howie Lee's, the Tyrell Corporation building, and J.F. Sebastian's hotel are faithfully replicated.&lt;ref name=BRcast/&gt; The events portrayed in the 1997 game occur not after, but in parallel to those in the film. The player assumes the role of McCoy, another replicant-hunter working at the same time as Deckard. Although Deckard is seen in photo evidence and referred to in dialogue,&lt;ref name=BRcast&gt;Web archive. {{citation|url=http://www.brmovie.com/BR_Game_MW01.htm  |title=Blade Runner |publisher=BRMovie |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080714055512/http://www.brmovie.com/BR_Game_MW01.htm |archivedate = 2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deckard and McCoy never meet, preserving the canon of the film and the independence of the game plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkins&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tosca&quot; /&gt;

The PC game featured a non-linear plot, [[non-player character]]s that each ran in their own independent [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], and an unusual pseudo-3D engine (which eschewed polygonal solids in favor of [[Voxel#Computer gaming|voxel]] elements) that did not require the use of a 3D accelerator card to play the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Bates | first=Jason | title=Westwood's Blade Runner|journal=PC Gamer|volume=4|issue=9| publisher=Blade Zone | date=1997-09-09 | url=http://media.bladezone.com/contents/game/BR-PCGame1.html | accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series===
{{Main|Total Recall 2070}}
Though not an official sequel to ''Blade Runner'', ''Total Recall 2070'' was initially planned as a spin-off of the movie ''[[Total Recall]]'' but transformed into a hybrid of that movie and ''Blade Runner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Total Recall'' film had, like ''Blade Runner'', been based on a Philip K. Dick short story: &quot;[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]&quot;. There are many similarities between the [[television series]] and the ''Blade Runner'' universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Platt|first1=John|date=1999-03-01|url= http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue98/screen.html|title=A Total Recall spin-off that's an awful lot like Blade Runner |journal= Science Fiction Weekly|pages=Issue 98 Vol.5 No.9|accessdate=2008-02-06|nopp=true |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080115153719/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue98/screen.html |archivedate = 2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series takes place in a dark, crowded, industrial, and cosmopolitan setting. David Hume is a senior detective for the Citizens Protection Bureau (CPB) who is partnered with Ian Farve, an Alpha Class android. The series focused on questions such as the nature of humanity and the rights of androids.

'''William Henry''' &quot;'''Bill'''&quot; '''Gates III''' (born October 28, 1955)&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[business magnate]], [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]], author, and is [[chairman]] of [[Microsoft]], the software company he founded with [[Paul Allen]].  He is consistently ranked among the [[Forbes list of billionaires|world's wealthiest people]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

and was the wealthiest overall from 1995 to 2009, excluding 2008, when he was ranked third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates] Forbes.com. Retrieved April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of [[chief executive officer|CEO]] and [[software architect|chief software architect]], and remains the largest individual shareholder,  with more than 8 percent of the [[common stock]].&lt;ref&gt;Gates regularly documents his share ownership through public [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] [[form 4]] filings.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also authored or co-authored several books.

Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. Although he is admired by many, a number of industry insiders [[Criticism of Microsoft|criticize his business tactics]], which they consider anti-competitive, an opinion which has in some cases been upheld by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lesinski|2006|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later stages of his career, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], established in 2000.

Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000. He remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect. In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work, and full-time work at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He gradually transferred his duties to [[Ray Ozzie]], chief software architect, and [[Craig Mundie]], chief research and strategy officer. Gates' last full-time day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008. He remains at Microsoft as non-executive chairman.

==Early life==
Gates was born in [[Seattle]], Washington, to [[William H. Gates, Sr.]] and [[Mary Maxwell Gates]], of [[English people|English]], [[Germans|German]], and Scotch-Irish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/gates.html |title=Ancestry of Bill Gates |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Scottish Americans |publisher = albawest.com | url = http://www.albawest.com/scottish-americans.html | accessdate = April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family was upper middle class; his father was a prominent lawyer, his mother served on the board of directors for [[First Interstate BancSystem]] and the [[United Way of America|United Way]], and her father, J. W. Maxwell, was a [[National bank#United States|national bank]] president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He was the fourth of his name in his family, but was known as William Gates III or &quot;[[Trey]]&quot; because his father had dropped his own &quot;III&quot; suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on in his life, Gates' parents had a law career in mind for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a [[Congregational Christian Churches|Congregational]] church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Congregational 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Bill Gates: Entrepreneur and Philanthropist|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ubYgIB0TgUYC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Bill+Gates+Congregationalist&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RDmBTYG3C9GI0QGxvqn4CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=The Gates family regularly went to services at the University Congregational Church.|author=Jeanne M.

Berkowitz]]|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 13 he enrolled in the [[Lakeside School]], an exclusive preparatory school.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's [[rummage sale]] to buy an [[ASR-33 Teletype]] terminal and a block of computer time on a [[General Electric]] (GE) computer for the school's students.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of [[tic-tac-toe]] that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, &quot;There was just something neat about the machine.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;dlzsnr&quot;&gt;{{harv|Gates|1996|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] minicomputers. One of these systems was a [[PDP-10]] belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students—Gates, [[Paul Allen]], [[Ric Weiland]], and Kent Evans—for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the [[operating system]] to obtain free computer time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the system via teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied [[source code]] for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in [[FORTRAN]], [[LISP]], and [[machine language]]. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in [[COBOL]], providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with mostly female students. He later stated that &quot;it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;dlzsnr&quot;/&gt; At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called [[Traf-O-Data]], to make [[traffic counter]]s based on the [[Intel 8008]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gates|1996|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushpaa.org/history.php &quot;Congressional Page History&quot;], The United States House Page Association of America. &quot;The Page Program has produced many politicians, Members of Congress, as well as other famous men and women. Some of these include: the Honorable John Dingell, the longest serving Member of Congress, Bill Gates, founder and CEO of the Microsoft Corporation, and Donnald K. Anderson, former Clerk of the House.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the [[SAT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theweekmagazine.com/article.aspx?id=803 | title=The new—and improved?—SAT | accessdate = May 23, 2006 |work=The Week Magazine|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060510205250/http://theweekmagazine.com/article.aspx?id=803 |archivedate = May 10, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enrolled at [[Harvard College]] in the autumn of 1973.&lt;ref name = &quot;wzxoxv&quot;&gt;{{harv|Gates|1996|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Harvard, he met [[Steve Ballmer]], who later succeeded Gates as CEO of Microsoft.

In his sophomore year, Gates devised an algorithm for [[pancake sorting]] as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems&lt;ref name=&quot;Kestenbaum2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92236781|title=Before Microsoft, Gates Solved A Pancake Problem|last=Kestenbaum|first=David|date=July 4, 2008|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented in a [[combinatorics]] class by [[Harry R.

Gates did not have a definite study plan while a student at Harvard&lt;ref name = &quot;lmxgxg&quot;&gt;{{harv|Gates|1996|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent a lot of time using the school's computers. He remained in contact with Paul Allen, joining him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wallace|1993|59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year saw the release of the [[MITS Altair 8800]] based on the [[Intel 8080|Intel 8080 CPU]], and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gates|1996|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had talked this decision over with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much Gates wanted to start a company.&lt;ref name = &quot;lmxgxg&quot;/&gt;

==Microsoft==
{{Main|History of Microsoft|Microsoft}}

===BASIC===
[[Image:Altair 8800 Computer.jpg|thumb|200px|right|MITS Altair 8800 Computer with {{Convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} floppy disk system]]
After reading the January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' that demonstrated the [[Altair 8800]], Gates contacted [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]] (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a [[BASIC]] interpreter for the platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyevents&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Microsoft Visitor Center Student Information: Key Events in Microsoft History | url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |publisher=Microsoft | format=.DOC |accessdate=February 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president [[Ed Roberts (computers)|Ed Roberts]] agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair [[emulator]] that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as [[Altair BASIC]]. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Microsoft history|publisher=The History of Computing Project | url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm | accessdate=March 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership &quot;Micro-Soft&quot; and had their first office located in Albuquerque.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name &quot;Microsoft&quot; was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.

Microsoft's BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]] in the MITS newsletter saying that MITS could not continue to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software without payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp1&quot; /&gt; The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in [[Bellevue, Washington]] on January 1, 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyevents&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Key Events In Microsoft History | url=http://www.microsoft.com/visitorcenter/student.mspx | accessdate=April 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, he personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.&lt;ref name=&quot;waterloo&quot;&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx|last=Gates|first=Bill|title=Remarks by Bill Gates|date=October 13, 2005|location=Waterloo, Ontario|accessdate = March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IBM partnership===
In 1980, [[IBM]] approached Microsoft to write the BASIC interpreter for its upcoming personal computer, the [[IBM PC]]. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to [[Digital Research]] (DRI), makers of the widely used [[CP/M]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html|title=Pioneers Die Broke|work=[[Forbes]]|author=Maiello, John Steele Gordon Michael |date=December 23, 2002|accessdate =March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later Gates proposed using [[86-DOS]] (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that [[Tim Paterson]] of [[Seattle Computer Products]] (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as [[IBM PC-DOS|PC-DOS]] in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000. Gates did not offer to transfer the [[copyright]] on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gates|1996|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did, and the sales of [[MS-DOS]] made Microsoft a major player in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manes|1994|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates President of Microsoft and the
Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyevents&quot; /&gt;

===Windows===
Microsoft launched its first retail version of [[Microsoft Windows]] on November 20, 1985, and in August, the company struck a deal with [[IBM]] to develop a separate operating system called [[OS/2]]. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, mounting creative differences undermined the partnership. Gates distributed an internal memo on May 16, 1991, announcing that the OS/2 partnership was over and Microsoft would shift its efforts to the [[Windows NT]] [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bralyn.net/etext/literature/bill.gates/challenges-strategy.txt | title=May 16, 1991 internal strategies memo from Bill Gates |publisher=Bralyn|accessdate=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management style===
From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He aggressively broadened the company's range of products, and wherever Microsoft achieved a dominant position he vigorously defended it. He gained a reputation for being distant to others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that &quot;Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;freiberger19810831&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=%22radio%20shack%22%20%22model%20i%22&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q=%22radio%20shack%22%20%22model%20i%22&amp;f=false | title=Bugs in Radio Shack TRS-80 Model III: How Bad Are They? | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | author=Freiberger, Paul | date=August 31, 1981 | publisher=InfoWorld | page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an executive, Gates met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. Firsthand accounts of these meetings describe him as verbally combative, berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;rensin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=David|last=Rensin|title=The Bill Gates Interview|year=1994|journal=Playboy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/churchillclub.mspx | title=Steve Ballmer Speech Transcript&amp;nbsp;— Church Hill Club | first=Steve|last=Ballmer | date=October 9, 1997 |publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He often interrupted presentations with such comments as, &quot;That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time GOS&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/gates/gates5.html | first=Walter | last=Isaacson | title=The Gates Operating System |work=Time | date=January 13, 1997 | accessdate=March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, &quot;Why don't you just give up your [[Option (finance)|options]] and join the [[Peace Corps]]?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.breakingwindows.net/1link3.htm | title=Breaking Windows |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | author= Bank, David|date=February 1, 1999 | accessdate=March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.&lt;ref name=&quot;time GOS&quot; /&gt; When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, &quot;I'll do it over the weekend.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chapman&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Gates's role at Microsoft for most of its history was primarily a management and executive role. However, he was an active software developer in the early years, particularly on the company's [[programming language]] products. He has not officially been on a development team since working on the [[TRS-80 Model 100]],&lt;ref name=allison1993&gt;{{cite web|last=Allison|first=David (interviewer)|title=Bill Gates Interview|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/comphist/gates.htm#tc35|publisher=National Museum of American History|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but wrote code as late as 1989 that shipped in the company's products.&lt;ref name=&quot;pdc97&quot;/&gt; On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors, placing [[Ray Ozzie]] in charge of day-to-day management and [[Craig Mundie]] in charge of long-term product strategy.&lt;ref name=&quot;mscorpnews&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-15CorpNewsPR.mspx | title=Microsoft Announces Plans for July 2008 Transition for Bill Gates |publisher=Microsoft|date=June 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antitrust litigation===

[[Image:Billgates.JPG|thumb|Bill Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on August 27, 1998]]

Many decisions that led to [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner [[David Boies]] over the contextual meaning of words like &quot;compete&quot;, &quot;concerned&quot; and &quot;we&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=March 30, 2008|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html|title=Gates deposition makes judge laugh in court|publisher=CNN|date=November 17, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BusinessWeek'' reported:

{{quotation|Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail Gates both sent and received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 30, 2008|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1998/48/b3606125.htm|title=Microsoft's Teflon Bill|work=BusinessWeek|date=November 30, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gates later said that he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, &quot;Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;truth&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heilemann|first=John|title=The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth|date=November 1, 2000|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft_pr.html|accessdate = March 31, 2008|month=May|author=Chen, Hy; Wu, Js; Hyland, B; Lu, Xd; Chen, Jj|volume=46|issue=8|page=833|pmid=18509686|doi=10.1007/s11517-008-0355-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Gates's denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed [[monopolization]] and [[tying (commerce)|tying]], and blocking competition, both in violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;truth&quot; /&gt;

===Appearance in ads===
Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft in 2008. The first commercial, co-starring [[Jerry Seinfeld]], is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in [[New Mexico]] in 1977 for a traffic violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/gatesmug1.html |title=The Smoking Gun mugshots |publisher=Thesmokinggun.com |date= |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a yes, he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a yes. Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about &quot;nothing&quot; (''[[Seinfeld]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adblog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/08/1362333.aspx |title=MSNBC adblog site |publisher=Adblog.msnbc.msn.com |date= |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.

==Post-Microsoft==
Since leaving Microsoft, Gates continues his philanthropy and, among other projects, purchased the video rights to the [[Messenger Lectures]] series called ''[[The Character of Physical Law]]'', given at [[Cornell University]] by [[Richard Feynman]] in 1964 and recorded by the BBC. The videos are available online to the public at Microsoft's [[Project Tuva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fried |first=Ina |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10286732-56.html |title=CNET Project Tuva |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=July 14, 2009 |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Access-Project-Tuva-for-Free-Courtesy-of-Bill-Gates-116778.shtml |title=Softpedia |publisher=News.softpedia.com |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Gates was invited to visit and speak at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where he asked the students to take on the hard problems of the world in their futures.&lt;ref&gt;Guo, Jeff; McQueen, Rob,

[[Bill Gates' house|The Gates' home]] is an [[earth sheltering|earth-sheltered house]] in the side of a hill overlooking [[Lake Washington]] in Medina. According to [[King County, Washington|King County]] public records, as of 2006 the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125&amp;nbsp;million, and the annual property tax is $991,000.

Also among Gates's private acquisitions is the [[Codex Leicester]], a collection of writings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], which Gates bought for $30.8&amp;nbsp;million at an auction in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lesinski|2006|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates is also known as an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Gates was number one on the [[Forbes 400]] list from 1993 through to 2007 and number one on ''Forbes'' list of [[Lists of billionaires|The World's Richest People]] from 1995 to 2007 and 2009. In 1999, Gates's wealth briefly surpassed $101&amp;nbsp;billion, causing the media to call him a &quot;centibillionaire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fridson|2001|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the [[dot-com bubble]] burst and the multi-billion dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolger|first=Joe|date=May 5, 2006|title=I wish I was not the richest man in the world, says Bill Gates|work=[[The Times]]|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/markets/united_states/article713434.ece|accessdate = March 31, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667 and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Microsoft 2006 Proxy Statement | url=http://www.microsoft.com/msft/reports/proxy2006.mspx |publisher=Microsoft | date=October 6, 2007 | accessdate=February 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded [[Corbis]], a digital imaging company, in 1989.

===Philanthropy===

{{See| Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}

Gates began to appreciate the expectations others had of him when public opinion mounted suggesting that he could give more of his wealth to charity. Gates studied the work of [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]], and in 1994 sold some of his Microsoft stock to create the William H. Gates Foundation. In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations into one to create the charitable [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], which is the largest transparently operated charitable foundation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 1, 2008|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6919139|title=Flat-pack accounting |work=[[The Economist]]|date=May 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation allows benefactors access to information regarding how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the [[Wellcome Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 1, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3913581.stm|title=Bill Gates: billionaire philanthropist |publisher=BBC News|date=January 25, 2005|author=Cronin, Jon }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 1, 2008|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/|title=Our Approach to Giving |publisher=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080404212231/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/ |archivedate = April 4, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generosity and extensive philanthropy of [[David Rockefeller]] has been credited as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and modeled their giving in part on the [[Rockefeller family]]'s philanthropic focus, namely those global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;bill foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=2005 Annual Report | format= PDF |publisher=[[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] | url=http://www.rbf.org/usr_doc/2005_Annual_Review.pdf | date=January 1, 2006 | accessdate=February 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28&amp;nbsp;billion to charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bwnt.businessweek.com/interactive%5Freports/philanthropy%5Findividual/ The 50 most generous Americans].&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation was at the same time criticized because it invests assets that it has not yet distributed with the exclusive goal of maximizing [[return on investment]]. As a result, its investments include companies that have been charged with worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the Foundation is attempting to relieve poverty. These include companies that pollute heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gatesx07jan07,0,6827615.story Dark cloud over good works of Gates Foundation], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to press criticism, the foundation announced in 2007 a review of its investments, to assess social responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003517601_gatesinvest10.html Gates Foundation to review investments], The Seattle Times, January 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/nation/01/14/14gates.html Gates Foundation to maintain its investment plan], ''The Austin Statesman'', January 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates's wife urged people to learn a lesson from the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in ''[[The Power of Half]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/life-style/general/they-half-it-in-them-1.686505 |title=They half it in them |publisher=Gulf News |author=Bina Abraham |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor [[Warren Buffett]], and [[Mark Zuckerberg]] ([[Facebook]]'s CEO) signed a promise they called the &quot;Gates-Buffet [[Giving Pledge]]&quot;, in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss |first=Rosabeth |url=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/dec2010/ca20101214_945792.htm |title=Four Strategic Generosity Lessons|work=Business Week |date=December 14, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38556042/ns/us_news-giving/ | title= 40 billionaires pledge to give away half of wealth| accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/natural-home-living/a-rich-gift-homemade-jelly-for-bill-melinda-gates.aspx |title=A Rich Gift: Homemade Jelly for Bill and Melinda Gates |work=Mother Earth News |date=February 22, 2011 |author= Robyn Griggs Lawrence|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition===
In 1987 Gates was officially declared a billionaire in the pages of Forbes' 400 Richest People in America issue, just days before his 32nd birthday. As the world's youngest self-made billionaire, he was worth $1.25&amp;nbsp;billion, over $900&amp;nbsp;million more than he'd been worth the year before, when he'd debuted on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/19/young-tech-billionaire-gates-google-yahoo-wealth.html |title=The Next Bill Gates |publisher=Forbes.com |date=January 19, 2010 |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |first=Marie |last=Thibault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine named Gates [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century#The only people to shape both the 20th century and the early 21st|one of the 100 people who most influenced the 20th century]], as well as [[Time 100|one of the 100 most influential people of 2004, 2005, and 2006]].

'''Belgian Blue''' [[cattle]] are a [[beef]] breed from [[Belgium]], known in French as ''{{lang|fr|Race de la Moyenne et Haute Belgique}}''. Alternative names include Belgian Blue-White, Belgian White and Blue Pied, Belgian White Blue, Blue and Blue Belgian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle/belgianblue/index.htm Oklahoma State University breed profile]&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpted, heavily muscled appearance is known as &quot;[[double muscling]]&quot;, and is a trait shared by the [[Piedmontese (cattle)|Piedmontese breed]]. They are named for their typically blue-grey mottled hair colour, although it can vary from white to black.

The Belgian Blue has a natural [[mutation]] of the gene that codes for [[myostatin]], a protein that counteracts muscle growth. The truncated myostatin is unable to function in this capacity, resulting in accelerated lean muscle growth, due primarily to [[hyperplasia]] rather than [[hypertrophy]]. The defect in the breed's [[myostatin]] [[gene]] is maintained through linebreeding. This mutation also interferes with fat deposition, resulting in very lean meat. The [[:wikt:neonatal|neonatal]] calf is so large that [[Caesarean section]]s are routinely done.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheville256&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cheville|1999|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double-muscled cows also can experience [[dystocia]], even when bred to normal beef bulls or dairy bulls, because of narrowing of the birth canal.

The breed originated in central and upper Belgium in the nineteenth century, from crossing local cattle with [[Shorthorn cattle]] from the [[United Kingdom]] and probably with [[Charolais cattle]]. At first there were milking strains and beef strains of the breed. The modern beef breed was developed in the 1950s by Professor Hanset, working at an [[artificial insemination]] centre in [[Liege (province)|Liege]] province.

Critics call Belgian blues &quot;monster cows&quot; and some countries' governments, including [[Denmark]], have advocated eliminating the strain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cphpost.dk/print.jsp?o_id=56993 The Copenhagen Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox boron}}

'''Boron''' ({{IPA-en|ˈbɔərɒn}}) is the [[chemical element]] with [[atomic number]] 5 and the chemical symbol&amp;nbsp;'''B'''. Boron is a [[metalloid]]. A low-abundance element in both the solar system and the Earth's crust, boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally-occurring compounds, the [[borate mineral]]s. These are mined industrially as [[evaporate]] [[ore]]s, such as [[borax]] and [[kernite]].

Elemental boron is not found naturally. Industrially, very pure isolated boron is produced with difficulty, as boron tends to form refractory materials containing small amounts of carbon or other elements. Several [[allotropy|allotropes]] of boron exist: [[amorphous]] boron is a brown powder and crystalline boron is black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on [[Mohs Scale|Mohs' scale]]), and a poor conductor at room temperature. Elemental boron is used as a [[dopant]] in the [[semiconductor industry]].

The major uses of boron compounds are in [[sodium perborate]] bleaches, and the borax component of fiberglass insulation. Boron compounds play specialized roles as high-strength lightweight structural and refractory materials. They are used in glasses and ceramics to give them resistance to [[thermal shock]]. Boron-containing [[reagents]] are used for the [[organic synthesis|synthesis of organic compounds]], and as an intermediate in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals that do not contain boron.

In biology, borates have low toxicity in mammals (similar to table salt), but much more so to many [[arthropod]]s. A boron-containing natural antibiotic is known. Small amounts of boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron a necessary element in soils. Experiments indicate a role for boron as an [[ultratrace element]] in animals, but the nature of its role in animal physiology is unknown.

==History and etymology==
The name boron originates from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''بورق'' ''buraq'' or the [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''بوره'' ''burah'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title =The Origins of English Words: A Discursive Dictionary of Indo-European Roots|first = Joseph T.|last = Shipley|publisher = JHU Press|year = 2001|isbn = 9780801867842|url = http://books.google.com/?id=m1UKpE4YEkEC&amp;pg=PA83}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are names for the mineral [[borax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.innvista.com/science/chemistry/elements/etymolo.htm|title = Etymology of Elements|publisher = innvista|accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sassolite.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Sassolite]]
Boron compounds were known thousands of years ago. Borax was known from the deserts of western Tibet, where it received the name of ''tincal'', derived from the [[Sanskrit]]. Borax glazes were used in China from AD300, and some tincal even reached the West, where the Arabic alchemist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] seems to mention it in 700. [[Marco Polo]] brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in [[metallurgy]]. In 1777, [[boric acid]] was recognized in the hot springs ([[soffioni]]) near [[Florence]], Italy, and became known as ''sal sedativum'', with mainly medical uses. The rare mineral is called [[sassolite]], which is found at Sasso, Italy. Sasso was the main source of European borax from 1827 to 1872, at which date American sources replaced it.&lt;ref name=borates/&gt;&lt;ref name=boron/&gt;

Boron was not recognized as an element until it was isolated by Sir [[Humphry Davy]]&lt;ref&gt;Davy, H. (1809) &quot;[http://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An account of some new analytical researches on the nature of certain bodies, particularly the alkalies, phosphorus, sulphur, carbonaceous matter, and the acids hitherto undecomposed: with some general observations on chemical theory],&quot; ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', vol. 99, pp. 33–104.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Louis Jacques Thénard]]&lt;ref&gt;Gay Lussac, J.L. and Thenard, L.J.

Davy called the element ''boracium''.&lt;ref name=&quot;weeks&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Weeks|first = Mary Elvira|year = 1933|title = The Discovery of the Elements|publisher = Journal of Chemical Education|location = Easton, PA|chapter = XII.

===Chemistry of the element===
{{See also|Category:Boron compounds}}
Elemental boron is rare and poorly studied because the material is extremely difficult to prepare. Most studies on &quot;boron&quot; involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon. Chemically, boron behaves more closely to [[silicon]] than to [[aluminium]]. Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling [[hydrofluoric acid|hydrofluoric]] or [[hydrochloric acid]]. When finely divided, it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]], hot concentrated [[nitric acid]], hot [[sulfuric acid]] or hot mixture of sulfuric and [[chromic acid]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laubengayer&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Boron.

The rate of oxidation of boron depends upon the crystallinity, particle size, purity and temperature. Boron does not react with air at room temperature, but at higher temperatures it burns to form [[boron trioxide]]:
:4 B + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
[[File:Tetraborate-xtal-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|Ball-and-stick model of tetraborate anion, [B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, as it occurs in crystalline borax, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]·8H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Boron atoms are pink, with bridging oxygens in red, and four hydroxyl hydrogens in white. Note two borons are trigonally bonded sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with no formal charge, while the other two borons are tetrahedrally bonded sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, each carrying a formal charge of −1. The oxidation state of all borons is III. This mixture of boron coordination numbers and formal charges is characteristic of natural boron minerals.]]

Boron undergoes halogenation to give trihalides, for example,:
:2 B + 3 Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
These trihalides in practice are usually made from the oxides.

====Chemical compounds====
In its most familiar compounds, boron has the formal oxidation state III. These include oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and halides.

The trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure. These compounds are [[Lewis acid]]s in that they readily form [[adduct]]s with electron-pair donors, which are called [[Lewis base]]s. For example, fluoride (F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[boron trifluoride]] (BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) combined to give the [[tetrafluoroborate]] anion, BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. Boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form [[boric acid]].

Boron is found in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often associated with other elements. The more than one hundred [[borate mineral|borate]]s all feature boron in oxidation state +3. These mineral resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never feature boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral [[borax]], shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate centers is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in borax.

The [[boron nitride]]s are notable for the variety of structures that they adopt. They adopt structures analogous to various allotropes of [[carbon]], including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure called cubic boron nitride (tradename [[Borazon]]), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds can be viewed as a [[coordinate covalent bond]], wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the [[Lewis base]] to a bond to the [[Lewis acid]]ic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogues of graphite, the positively charged boron and negatively charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane, consequently graphic and hexagonal boron nitride have very different properties.

=====Organoboron chemistry=====
{{Main|organoboron chemistry}}
A large number of organoboron compounds are known and many are useful in [[organic synthesis]]. Organoboron(III) compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar, for example, [[tetraphenylborate]] (B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) vs [[triphenylborane]] (B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Many are produced from [[hydroboration–oxidation reaction|hydroboration]], which employs [[diborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).

=====Compounds of B(I) and B(II)=====
[[File:Boron-trifluoride-pi-bonding-2D.png|100px|thumb|[[Boron trifluoride|Boron (III) trifluoride]] structure, showing &quot;empty&quot; boron p orbital in pi-type [[coordinate covalent bond]]s]]
Boron forms a variety of stable compounds with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compound, oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is not isolable in condensed form, but [[Diboron tetrafluoride|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are well characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binary metal-boron compounds, the metal borides, feature boron in oxidation state less than III. Illustrative is [[magnesium diboride]] (MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In this material, the boron centers are trigonal planar, forming sheets akin to the carbon in [[graphite]]. Each boron has a formal −1 charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of 2+. In 2001 this material was found to be a high-temperature [[superconductor]].
[[File:Magnesium-diboride-3D-balls.png|thumb|Ball-and-stick model of superconductor magnesium diboride. Boron atoms lie in hexagonal aromatic graphite-like layers, with a charge of −1 per boron. Magnesium (II) ions lie between layers]]
Other borides find specialized applications as hard materials for cutting tools.

From the structural perspective, the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the hydrides. Included in this series are the cluster compounds [[dodecaborate]] (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;), [[decaborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;), and the [[carborane]]s such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Characteristically such compounds feature boron with coordination numbers greater than four.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of boron}}
Boron has two naturally occurring and stable [[isotope]]s, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B (80.1%) and &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B (19.9%). The mass difference results in a wide range of δ&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B and &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;B which decays through [[proton emission]] and [[alpha decay]]. It has a [[half-life]] of 3.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt; [[Second|s]]. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B([[oxygen|O]][[hydrogen|H]])&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [[tetrahydroxyborate|[B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O phase changes in [[hydrothermal]] systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; [[ion]] onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and therefore may be responsible for the large &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B enrichment in seawater relative to both [[ocean]]ic crust and [[continent]]al crust; this difference may act as an [[isotopic signature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first = S.|last = Barth| title = Boron isotopic analysis of natural fresh and saline waters by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry| journal = Chemical Geology| volume = 143|year = 1997|pages = 255–261|doi = 10.1016/S0009-2541(97)00107-1| issue = 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exotic &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;B exhibits a [[nuclear halo]], i.e. its radius is appreciably larger than that predicted by the [[Semi-empirical mass formula|liquid drop model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Two-body and three-body halo nuclei| first = Z.|last = Liu|journal = Science in China G: Physics Mechanics and Astronomy| volume = 46| year= 2003| page = 441|doi = 10.1360/03yw0027| issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enriched boron (boron-10)====
[[File:Neutroncrosssectionboron.png|right|320px|thumb|Neutron cross section of boron (top curve is for &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and bottom curve for &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B)]]
The &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B isotope is good at capturing [[thermal neutron]]s. Natural boron is about 20% &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and 80% &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B. The [[nuclear power|nuclear industry]] enriches natural boron to nearly pure &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B. The less-valuable by-product, depleted boron, is nearly pure &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B (see below). Enriched boron or &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B is used in both radiation shielding and in [[boron neutron capture therapy]]. In the latter, a compound containing &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B is attached to a [[muscle]] near a [[tumor]]. The patient is then treated with a relatively low dose of thermal neutrons. This causes energetic and short range alpha radiation from the boron to bombard the tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title =A Critical Assessment of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy: An Overview|journal = Journal of Neuro-Oncology|volume = 62|issue = 1|year = 2003|doi = 10.1023/A:1023262817500|pages = 1–5|first = Rolf F.|last = Barth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Radiation Research|pages = 1–18|volume =151| issue =1|year = 1999|title =The Radiation Biology of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy|first = Jeffrey A.|last = Coderre|doi = 10.2307/3579742|pmid = 9973079|last2 = Morris|first2 = GM|jstor = 3579742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Boron Neutron Capture Therapy of Cancer|first =Rolf F.|last =Barth|url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/citation/50/4/1061|journal = Cancer Research|volume = 50|pages = 1061–1070|date=15 February 1990|pmid = 2404588|issue = 4|author2 = S|author3 = F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nuclear reactors, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B is used for reactivity control and in [[Scram|emergency shutdown systems]]. It can serve either function in the form of [[borosilicate]] [[control rods]] or as [[boric acid]]. In [[pressurized water reactor]]s, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.&lt;ref name=reactor&gt;{{Cite book|last = Duderstadt|first = James J.|coauthors = Hamilton, Louis J.| title = Nuclear Reactor Analysis|publisher = Wiley-Interscience|year = 1976|isbn = 0471223638|page= 245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B has a theoretical role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN [[Inorganic nanotube|nanotube]] material) which would also serve a special role in the radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with [[cosmic rays]], which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy [[spallation]] neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as [[polyethylene]], but the moderated neutrons continue to be a radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li and &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title= Handbook of semiconductor manufacturing technology| first = R.|last = Doering|coauthor = Nishi Y.|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2007| isbn = 1574446754| pages = 31–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Depleted boron (boron-11)====
[[Cosmic radiation]] will produce secondary neutrons if it hits spacecraft structures. Those neutrons will be captured in &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B, if it is present in the spacecraft's [[semiconductors]], producing a [[gamma ray]], an [[alpha particle]], and a [[lithium]] ion. These resultant decay products may then irradiate nearby semiconductor 'chip' structures, causing data loss (bit flipping, or [[single event upset]]). In [[radiation hardened]] semiconductor designs, one countermeasure is to use '''depleted boron''' which is greatly enriched in &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B and contains almost no &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B. &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B is largely immune to radiation damage. Depleted boron is a by-product of the [[nuclear power|nuclear industry]].&lt;ref name=reactor/&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B is also a candidate as a fuel for [[aneutronic fusion]]. When struck by a proton with energy of about 500&amp;nbsp;k[[Electronvolt|eV]], it produces three alpha particles and 8.7&amp;nbsp;MeV of energy. Most other fusion reactions involving hydrogen and helium produce penetrating neutron radiation, which weakens reactor structures and induces long term radioactivity thereby endangering operating personnel. Whereas, the [[alpha particles]] from &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B fusion can be turned directly into electric power, and all radiation stops as soon as the reactor is turned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = W. M.|last = Nevins|title = A Review of Confinement Requirements for Advanced Fuels|journal = Journal of Fusion Energy|volume = 17|issue = 1|year = 1998|doi = 10.1023/A:1022513215080|pages = 25–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NMR spectroscopy====
Both &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B possess [[nuclear spin]]. The nuclear spin of &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B is 3 and that of &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B is 3/2. These isotopes are, therefore, of use in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy; and spectrometers specially adapted to detecting the boron-11 nuclei are available commercially. The &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B nuclei also cause splitting in the [[resonances]] of attached nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Boron NMR| url = http://rmn.iqfr.csic.es/guide/eNMR/chem/B.html| accessdate= 2009-05-05|publisher = BRUKER Biospin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boric acid is sometimes found in [[volcano|volcanic]] spring waters.

[[Ulexite]] is one of over a hundred [[borate mineral]]s; it is a fibrous crystal where individual fibers can guide light like [[fiber optics|optical fibers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| pages = 421–422| title = The Book of Stones: Who They Are and What They Teach| author = Simmons, R.; Ahsian, N.; Raven, H.|publisher = North Atlantic Books| year = 2007| isbn = 1556436688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economically important sources of boron are rasorite (kernite) and tincal (borax ore). They are both found in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[California]], but the largest borax deposits are in Central and Western [[Turkey]] including the provinces of [[Eskişehir]], [[Kütahya]] and [[Balıkesir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Kistler|first = R.

==Production==&lt;!--about making elemental boron (purely an academic endeavor) --&gt;
The production of boron compounds does not involve formation of elemental boron, but exploits the convenient availability of borates.

The earliest routes to elemental boron involved reduction of [[boric oxide]] with metals such as [[magnesium]] or [[aluminium]]. However the product is almost always contaminated with metal [[boride]]s. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with [[hydrogen]] at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron, for the use in semiconductor industry, is produced by the decomposition of [[diborane]] at high temperatures and then further purified with the [[zone melting]] or [[Czochralski process]]es.&lt;ref name=berger&gt;{{Cite book| title = Semiconductor materials| author = Berger, L. I.|publisher = CRC Press| year = 1996| isbn = 0849389127| pages = 37–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotope enrichment===
Because of its high neutron cross-section, boron-10 is often used to control fission in nuclear reactors as a neutron-capturing substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bibliothek.fzk.de/zb/berichte/FZKA6746.pdf|title = Results of the B4C Control Rod Test QUENCH-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed, however only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the [[dimethyl ether]] adduct of [[boron trifluoride]] (DME-BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and column chromatography of borates are being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://library.igcar.gov.in/html/Contents/IGCNewsletter/nl48/A2.htm|title = Commissioning of Boron Enrichment Plant|publisher = Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research|accessdate = 2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--{{doi|10.1080/01496398608056140}} An enrichment from 18% to above 94% Eagle-Picher Technologies Enriched Boron --&gt;

===Market trend===
Estimated global consumption of boron rose to a record 1.8&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in 2005, following a period of strong growth in demand from Asia, Europe and North America. Boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade.

The form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years. The use of ores like [[colemanite]] has declined following concerns over [[arsenic]] content. Consumers have moved towards the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content. The average cost of crystalline boron is $5/g.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rareearth.org/boron_properties.htm |publisher = Los Alamos National Laboratory|title = Boron Properties|accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing demand for boric acid has led a number of producers to invest in additional capacity. Eti Mine Company of Turkey opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at [[Emet]] in 2003. [[Rio Tinto Group]] increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006. Chinese boron producers have been unable to meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates. This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate ([[borax]]) growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28% per year over the same period.&lt;ref name=roskill&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Economics of Boron, 11th edition| year = 2006| isbn = 0862145163| publisher = Roskill Information Services, Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.ceramicindustry.com/Articles/Cover_Story/4b0b7a6ed1cb8010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____| accessdate = 2009-05-05| title = Raw and Manufactured Materials 2006 Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in global demand has been driven by high growth rates in [[glass (fiber)|fiberglass]] and [[borosilicate]] production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Asia with a consequent increase in demand for borates has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.&lt;ref name=roskill/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.roskill.com/reports/boron| title = Roskill reports: boron|publisher = Roskill|accessdate = 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main use of boron compounds is in the form of [[sodium tetraborate]] pentahydrate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) for making insulating fiberglass and sodium perborate [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]].&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{Cite book| author = Hammond, C.

===Detergents formulations and bleaching agents===
Borax is used in laundry products, mainly as a precursor to bleaches. Specifically, [[sodium perborate]] serves as a source of [[active oxygen]] in many [[detergent]]s, [[laundry detergent]]s, [[cleaning product]]s, and laundry [[bleach]]es.

[[File:Schott Duran glassware.jpg|thumb|upright|Borosilicate glassware. Displayed are two beakers and a test tube.]]
Nearly all boron ore extracted from the Earth is destined for refinement into [[boric acid]] and [[sodium tetraborate]]. In the United States, 70% of the boron is used for the production of glass and ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/boron/| title = Boron: Statistics and Information| accessdate= 2009-05-05| publisher = USGS}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Borosilicate]] glass, which is typically 12–15% B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 80% SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 2% Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, has a low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] giving it a good resistance to thermal shock.

Boron fibers and sub-millimeter sized crystalline boron springs are produced by [[laser]]-assisted [[chemical vapor deposition]]. Translation of the focused laser beam allows to produce even complex helical structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties ([[elastic modulus]] 450&amp;nbsp;GPa, fracture strain 3.7%, fracture stress 17&amp;nbsp;GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in [[Microelectromechanical systems|micromechanical systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Microfabrication of three-dimensional boron structures by laser chemical processing| journal = Journal Applied Physics|volume = 72| pages = 5956–5963|year =1992| doi = 10.1063/1.351904|first = S.|last = Johansson| last2 = Schweitz| first2 = Jan-Åke| last3 = Westberg| first3 = Helena| last4 = Boman| first4 = Mats| issue = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shielding in nuclear reactors===
Boron shielding is used as a control for [[nuclear reactor]]s, taking advantage of its high cross-section for neutron capture.

===Semiconductor industry===
Boron is a useful [[dopant]] for such semiconductors as [[silicon]], [[germanium]], and [[silicon carbide]]. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a [[Electron hole|hole]] resulting in [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its [[atomic diffusion]] at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), liquid (BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), or gaseous boron sources (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). However, after 1970s, it was mostly replaced by [[ion implantation]], which relies mostly on BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a boron source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|pages = 51–54|title = Fundamentals of semiconductor manufacturing and process control|last = May|first = Gary S.|coauthor = Spanos, Costas J.|publisher = John Wiley and Sons|year = 2006|isbn=0471784060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boron trichloride gas is also an important chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for [[plasma etching]] of metals and their oxides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|pages = 39–60|title = Semiconductor industry: wafer fab exhaust management|first = J. Michael|last = Sherer|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2005|isbn = 1574447203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triethylborane is also injected into [[Chemical vapor deposition|vapor deposition]] reactors as a boron source.

===Engineering materials===
[[File:Bodyarmor.jpg|thumb|upright|Boron carbide is used for inner plates of ballistic vests]]
[[Boron carbide]], a ceramic material which is obtained by decomposing B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with carbon in the electric furnace:
:2 B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 7 C → B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C + 6 CO

It is used in [[Vehicle armour|tank armor]], [[bulletproof vest]]s, and numerous other structural applications. Its ability to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived [[radionuclide]]s makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, to increase its surface area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Alan W.|last = Weimer| title = Carbide, Nitride and Boride Materials Synthesis and Processing| isbn = 0-412-54060-6| year = 1997| publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall (London, New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several boron compounds are known for their extreme hardness and toughness, including
*[[Heterodiamond]] (also called BCN);
*[[Boron nitride]]. This material is isoelectronic to [[carbon]]. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN is used as a high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name [[borazon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first = R. H.|last = Wentorf|title = Cubic form of boron nitride|journal = J. Chem Phys.|volume = 26|year = 1957| page = 956| doi = 10.1063/1.1745964| issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller, but chemical stability is superior to that of diamond.
*[[Rhenium diboride]] can be produced at ambient pressures, but is rather expensive because of rhenium. The hardness of ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits considerable [[anisotropy]] because of its hexagonal layered structure. Its value is comparable to that of [[tungsten carbide]], [[silicon carbide]], [[titanium diboride]] or [[zirconium diboride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/adma.200801471|title=Is Rhenium Diboride a Superhard Material?|year=2008|author=Qin, Jiaqian|journal=Advanced Materials|volume=20|pages=4780|last2=He|first2=Duanwei|last3=Wang|first3=Jianghua|last4=Fang|first4=Leiming|last5=Lei|first5=Li|last6=Li|first6=Yongjun|last7=Hu|first7=Juan|last8=Kou|first8=Zili|last9=Bi|first9=Yan|issue=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*AlMgB&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; + TiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composites possess high hardness and wear resistance and are used in either bulk form or as coatings for components exposed to high temperatures and wear loads.&lt;ref name=&quot;tib1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.stam.2007.06.009|title = Preparation of titanium diboride TiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by spark plasma sintering at slow heating rate|year = 2007|last = Schmidt|first = Jürgen|journal = Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume = 8|pages = 376|last2 = Boehling|first2 = Marian|last3 = Burkhardt|first3 = Ulrich|last4 = Grin|first4 = Yuri|issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boron carbide and cubic boron nitride powders are widely used as abrasives. Metal [[boride]]s are used for coating tools through [[chemical vapor deposition]] or [[physical vapor deposition]]. Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through [[ion implantation]] or [[ion beam deposition]], results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose. These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties to those of the bulk boride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Materials Science of Carbides, Nitrides and Borides| author = Gogotsi, Y.

Levels as low as 0.8&amp;nbsp;ppm can cause these same symptoms to appear in plants particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of boron in the soil, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when boron content in the soil is greater than 1.8&amp;nbsp;ppm.

As an [[ultratrace element]], boron is necessary for the optimal health of rats, although it is necessary in such small amounts that ultrapurified foods and dust filtration of air is necessary to induce boron deficiency, which manifest as poor coat or hair quality. Presumably, boron is necessary to other mammals. No deficiency syndrome in humans has been described. Small amounts of boron occur widely in the diet, and the amounts needed in the diet would, by analogy with rodent studies, be very small. The exact physiological role of boron in the animal kingdom is poorly understood.&lt;ref name =&quot;utrace&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ultratrace elements in nutrition: Current knowledge and speculation| first = Forrest H.|last = Nielsen|journal =The Journal of Trace Elements in Experimental Medicine|volume = 11| issue = 2–3 |pages =251–274| doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1520-670X(1998)11:2/3&lt;251::AID-JTRA15&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boron occurs in all foods produced from plants. Since 1989 its nutritional value has been argued.

The U.S. Department of agriculture conducted an experiment in which postmenopausal women took 3&amp;nbsp;mg of boron a day. The results showed that supplemental boron reduced excretion of calcium by 44%, and activated [[estrogen]] and [[vitamin D]], suggesting a possible role in the suppression of [[osteoporosis]]. However, whether these effects were conventionally nutritional, or medicinal, could not be determined. The US [[National Institutes of Health]] quotes this source:
:Total daily boron intake in normal [[diet (nutrition)|human diet]]s ranges from 2.1–4.3&amp;nbsp;mg boron/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Total boron|last = Zook|first = E. G.|journal = J.

===Analytical quantification===
For determination of boron content in food or materials the [[colorimetry|colorimetric]] curcumin method is used.

===Health issues===
Elemental boron and borates are non-toxic to humans and animals (approximately similar to table salt). The [[Median lethal dose|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6&amp;nbsp;g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; above 2&amp;nbsp;g are considered non-toxic. The minimum lethal dose for humans has not been established, but an intake of 4&amp;nbsp;g/day was reported without incidents, and medical dosages of 20&amp;nbsp;g of boric acid for neutron capture therapy caused no problems.

'''Bromine''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|r|oʊ|m|iː|n}} {{respell|BROH|meen}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|oʊ|m|ɨ|n}} {{respell|BROH|min}}; from {{lang-el|βρῶμος, ''brómos''}}, meaning &quot;stench (of he-goats)&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Gemoll&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author= Gemoll W, Vretska K|title= Griechisch-Deutsches Schul- und Handwörterbuch (&quot;Greek-German dictionary&quot;), 9th ed.| publisher=öbvhpt|isbn= 3-209-00108-1|year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Br''', an [[atomic number]] of 35, and an [[atomic mass]] of 79.904. It is in the [[halogen]] [[group (periodic table)|element group]]. The element was isolated independently by two chemists in 1825-26. Elemental bromine is a fuming red-brown liquid at room temperature, corrosive and toxic, with properties between those of [[chlorine]] and [[iodine]]. Free bromine does not occur in nature, but occurs as colorless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to [[table salt]].

Bromine is rarer than about three-quarters of elements in the Earth's crust, however the high solubility of bromide ion has caused its accumulation in the oceans, and commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel, and China. About 556,000 metric tons were produced in 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jack F. Mills |title=Bromine: in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|publisher= Wiley-VCH Verlag|location= Weinheim|year= 2002|doi=10.1002/14356007.a04_391}}&lt;/ref&gt; an amount similar to the far more abundant element [[magnesium]].

At high temperatures, [[organobromine compound]]s are easily converted to free bromine atoms, a process which acts to terminate [[free radical]] chemical [[chain reaction]]s. This makes such compounds useful [[fire retardant]]s and this is bromine's primary industrial use, consuming more than half of world production of the element. The same property allows volatile organobromine compounds, under the action of sunlight, to form free bromine atoms in the atmosphere which are highly effective in [[ozone depletion]]. This unwanted side-effect has caused many common volatile brominated organics like [[methyl bromide]], a pesticide that was formerly a large industrial bromine consumer, to be abandoned. Remaining uses of bromine compounds are in well-drilling fluids, as an intermediate in manufacture of organic chemicals, and in film photography.

Bromine has no essential function in mammals, though it is preferentially used over chloride by one antiparasitic enzyme in the human immune system. Organobromides are needed and produced enzymatically from bromide by some lower life forms in the sea, particularly [[algae]]. As a pharmaceutical, simple bromide ion, '''Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;,''' has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before being replaced by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as [[antiepileptic]]s.

==Characteristics==
===Physical===
[[File:Bromine vial in acrylic cube.jpg|thumb|left|[[Poly(methyl methacrylate)#Acrylate resin casting|Illustrative and secure]] bromine sample for teaching]]
Elemental bromine exists as a [[diatomic molecule]], Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a dense, mobile, slightly transparent reddish-brown liquid, that evaporates easily at [[standard temperature and pressure]]s to give an orange vapor (its color resembles [[nitrogen dioxide]]) that has a strongly disagreeable odor resembling that of [[chlorine]]. It is the only [[nonmetal]]lic element that is a liquid at [[room temperature]], and one of only two elements on the periodic table that are liquids at room temperature ([[mercury (element)|mercury]] is the other, although [[caesium]], [[gallium]], and [[rubidium]] melt just above room temperature).

At a pressure of 55&amp;nbsp;[[GPa]] bromine converts to a metal. At 75&amp;nbsp;GPa it converts to a face centered orthorhombic structure. At 100&amp;nbsp;GPa it converts to a body centered orthorhombic monoatomic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Duan|first = Defang|title = Ab initio studies of solid bromine under high pressure|journal = Physical Review B|volume = 76|date = 2007-09-26|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.76.104113|last2 = Liu|first2 = Yanhui|last3 = Ma|first3 = Yanming|last4 = Liu|first4 = Zhiming|last5 = Cui|first5 = Tian|last6 = Liu|first6 = Bingbing|last7 = Zou|first7 = Guangtian|pages = 104113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical===
Being less reactive than [[chlorine]] but more reactive than [[iodine]], bromine reacts vigorously with metals, especially in the presence of water, to give bromide salts. It is also reactive toward most organic compounds, especially upon [[photochemistry|illumination]], conditions that favor the dissociation of the diatomic molecule into bromine radicals:

: Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{\leftarrow}&lt;/math&gt; 2 Br'''·'''

It [[chemical bond|bonds]] easily with many elements and has a strong [[Bleach (chemical)|bleaching]] action.

Bromine is slightly [[solubility|soluble]] in [[water (molecule)|water]], but it is highly soluble in organic solvents such as [[carbon disulfide]], [[aliphatic]] [[alcohol]]s, and [[acetic acid]].

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of bromine}}
Bromine has two stable [[isotope]]s, &lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;Br (50.69&amp;nbsp;%) and &lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;Br (49.31%). At least another
23 [[radioisotopes]] are known to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=GE|publisher= Nuclear Energy|title=Chart of the Nuclides, 14th Edition|year=1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the bromine isotopes are fission products. Several of the heavier bromine isotopes from fission are delayed neutron emitters. All of the radioactive bromine isotopes are relatively short lived. The longest half life is the neutron deficient &lt;sup&gt;77&lt;/sup&gt;Br at 2.376 days. The longest half life on the neutron rich side is &lt;sup&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;Br at 1.471 days. A number of the bromine isotopes exhibit metastable isomers. Stable &lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;Br exhibits a radioactive [[nuclear isomer|isomer]], with a half life of 4.86 seconds. It decays by isomeric transition to the stable ground state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Audi|first = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal = Nuclear Physics A|volume = 729|page = 3| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center|year = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balard found bromide chemicals in the ash of [[seaweed]] from the [[salt marsh]]es of [[Montpellier]] in 1826. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance resembled that of an intermediate of chlorine and iodine; with those results he tried to prove that the substance was [[iodine monochloride]] (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element and named it muride, derived from the [[Latin]] word ''muria'' for brine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ballard&quot; /&gt;

Carl Jacob Löwig isolated bromine from a mineral water spring from his hometown [[Bad Kreuznach]] in 1825. Löwig used a solution of the mineral salt saturated with chlorine and extracted the bromine with [[diethyl ether]]. After evaporation of the ether a brown liquid remained. With this liquid as a sample for his work he applied for a position in the laboratory of [[Leopold Gmelin]] in [[Heidelberg]]. The publication of the results was delayed and Balard published his results first.&lt;ref name=&quot;Löwig&quot; /&gt;

After the French chemists [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]], [[Louis Jacques Thénard]], and [[Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac]] approved the experiments of the young pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the [[Académie des Sciences]] and published in ''Annales de Chimie et Physique''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bal1826&quot; /&gt; In his publication Balard states that he changed the name from ''muride'' to ''brôme'' on the proposal of M. Anglada. (''Brôme'' (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bal1826&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bal1826b&quot; &gt;{{cite journal | first=L.N.|last=Vauquelin|coauthors = Thenard, L.J.; Gay-Lussac, J.L. | year =1826 | title = Rapport sur la Mémoire de M.

J. Balard (1826) &quot;Mémoire sur une substance particulière contenue dans l'eau de la mer&quot; (Memoir on a particular substance contained in seawater), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', 2nd series, vol. 32, [http://books.google.com/books?id=vBIAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA337&amp;lpg=PA337#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 337-381] -- Balard states that Mr. Anglada persuaded him to name his new element ''brôme''. However, on page 382 of the same journal -- &quot;Rapport sur la Mémoire de M.

&lt;!-- Some also suggest that it may have been discovered by [[Bernard Courtois]], the man who discovered iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The first commercial use, besides some minor medical applications, was the use of bromine for the [[daguerreotype]]. In 1840 it was discovered that bromine had some advantages over the previously used iodine vapor to create the light sensitive [[silver halide]] layer used for daguerreotypy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Daguerreotype: Nineteenth-century Technology and Modern Science|first = M.

[[Potassium bromide]] and [[sodium bromide]] were used as [[anticonvulsant]]s and [[sedative]]s in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, until they were gradually superseded by [[chloral hydrate]] and then the [[barbiturate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A History of Psychiatry: From the Era of the Asylum to the Age of Prozac|first = Edward|last = Shorter| publisher = John Wiley and Sons|year = 1997|isbn = 9780471245315|page =200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diatomic element Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does not occur naturally. Instead, bromine exists exclusively as [[Bromide|bromide salts]] in diffuse amounts in [[crust (geology)|crustal]] rock. Owing to [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaching]], bromide salts have accumulated in sea water (65 [[part per million|ppm]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Minerals From Sea Salt|first = John A.|last = Tallmadge|coauthors = Butt, John B.; Solomon Herman J.|journal = Ind.

China's bromine reserves are located in the [[Shandong Province]] and Israel's bromine reserves are contained in the waters of the [[Dead Sea]]. The largest bromine reserve in the United States is located in [[Columbia County, Arkansas|Columbia County]] and [[Union County, Arkansas]], U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cals.lib.ar.us/butlercenter/lesson_plans/lesson%20plans/Lesson%20plans-retained/Bromine.pdf |title=Bromine:An Important Arkansas Industry|publisher= Butler Center for Arkansas Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Approximately 556,000 metric tons (worth around US $2.5 billion) of bromine is produced per year (2007) worldwide, with the [[United States]], [[Israel]], and [[China]] producing more than 80% of the world's supply, and Jordan and Japan producing much of the rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|last=Emsley|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|location=Oxford, England, UK|isbn=0198503407|chapter=Bromine|pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSCR2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bromine/bromimcs07.pdf|title = Commodity Report 2007: Bromine|first = Phyllis A. |last=Lyday| publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSYB2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bromine/myb1-2006-bromi.pdf|title = Mineral Yearbook 2007: Bromine|first = Phyllis A. |last=Lyday| publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bromine/mcs-2009-bromi.pdf 2009 mineral commodities report&lt;/ref&gt; Bromine production has increased sixfold since the 1960s.

Bromide-rich brines are treated with chlorine gas, flushing through with air. In this treatment, bromide anions are oxidized to bromine by the chlorine gas.
:2 Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Laboratory methods of production===
In the laboratory, because of its commercial availability and long shelf-life, bromine is not typically prepared. Small amounts of bromine can however be generated through the reaction of solid [[sodium bromide]] with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The first stage is formation of [[hydrogen bromide]] (HBr), which is a gas, but under the reaction conditions some of the HBr is oxidized further by the sulfuric acid to form bromine (Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
:NaBr (s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) → HBr (aq) + NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)
:2 HBr (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) → Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)

Similar alternatives, such as the use of dilute [[hydrochloric acid]] with [[sodium hypobromite]], are also available. The most important thing is that the [[anion]] of the [[acid]] (in the above examples, [[sulfate]] and [[chloride]], respectively) be more [[electronegative]] than bromine, allowing the [[substitution reaction]] to occur.

Reactions involving a strong oxidizing agent, such as potassium permanganate, on bromide ions in the presence of an acid also gives bromine. An acidic solution of bromate ions and bromide ions will also [[comproportionation|comproportionate]] slowly to give bromine.

Like iodine, bromine is soluble in chloroform but only slightly soluble in water. In water, the solubility can be increased by the presence of bromide ions. Concentrated solutions of bromine are rarely prepared in the lab because of hazards. Also as with iodine [[sodium thiosulphate]] (or any soluble thiosulfphate) is an effective reagent for reducing bromine to colorless odorless bromide, thus dealing with stains and odor from the element in unwanted places. For the same reason, thiosulfate is used in photography to deal with free bromine in emulsions.

==Compounds and chemistry==
{{refimprove|section|date=September 2010}}

===Organic chemistry===
{{Main|Organobromine compound}}
[[Image:N-Bromosuccinimide Structure.png|thumb|right|100px|''N''-Bromosuccinimide]]
Organic compounds are brominated by either [[Addition reaction|addition]] or [[Substitution (chemistry)|substitution reactions]]. Bromine undergoes electrophilic addition to the double-bonds of [[alkene]]s, via a cyclic bromonium intermediate. In non-aqueous solvents such as [[carbon disulfide]], this affords the di-bromo product. For example, reaction with [[ethylene]] will produce [[1,2-Dibromoethane|1,2-dibromoethane]]. Bromine also undergoes electrophilic addition to [[phenol]]s and [[aniline]]s. When used as bromine water, a small amount of the corresponding [[halohydrin formation reaction|bromohydrin is formed]] as well as the dibromo compound. So reliable is the reactivity of bromine that bromine water is employed as a reagent to test for the presence of alkenes, phenols, and anilines. Like the other halogens, bromine participates in [[free radical reaction]]s. For example, hydrocarbons are brominated upon treatment with bromine in the presence of light.

Bromine, sometimes with a catalytic amount of [[phosphorus]], easily brominates [[carboxylic acid]]s at the α-position. This method, the [[Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction]], is the basis of the commercial route to [[bromoacetic acid]]. [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-Bromosuccinimide]] is commonly used as a substitute for elemental bromine, being easier to handle, and reacting more mildly and thus more selectively. Organic bromides are often preferable relative to the less reactive chlorides and more expensive iodide-containing reagents. Thus, [[Grignard reaction|Grignard]] and organolithium compound are most often generated from the corresponding bromides.

Certain bromine-related compounds have been evaluated to have an [[ozone depletion potential]] or bioaccumulate in living organisms. As a result, many industrial bromine compounds are no longer manufactured, are being restricted, or scheduled for phasing out. The [[Montreal Protocol]] mentions several organobromine compounds for this phase out.

===Inorganic chemistry===

Inorganic bromine compounds adopt a variety of oxidation states from -1 to +7.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. ISBN 0-7506-3365-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromine is an oxidizer, and it will oxidize [[iodide]] ions to iodine, being itself reduced to [[bromide]]:

: Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2 Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Bromine will also oxidize metals and metalloids to the corresponding bromides. [[Anhydrous]] bromine is less reactive toward many metals than hydrated bromine, however. Dry bromine reacts vigorously with [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] as well as [[alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth]]s and [[alkali metal]]s.

Dissolving bromine in alkaline solution gives a mixture of bromide and [[hypobromite]]:

:Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + OBr&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
This hypobromite is responsible for the bleaching abilities of bromide solutions. Warming of these solutions causes the disproportion reaction of the hypobromite to give [[bromate]], a strong oxidising agent very similar to chlorate.

: 3 {{chem|BrO|-}} → {{chem|BrO|3|-}} + 2 {{chem|Br|-}}

In contrast to the route to [[perchlorate]]s, perbromates are not accessible through electrolysis but only by reacting bromate solutions with [[fluorine]] or [[ozone]].

: BrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|BrO|4|−}} + 2 HF
: BrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|BrO|4|−}} + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Bromine reacts violently and explosively with aluminium metal, forming aluminium bromide:

:2 Al + 3 Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 [[aluminium bromide|AlBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Bromine reacts with hydrogen in gaseous form and gives [[hydrogen bromide]]:

:[[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2[[hydrogen bromide|HBr]]

Bromine reacts with [[alkali metal]] iodides in a displacement reaction. This reaction forms alkali metal bromides and produces elemental [[iodine]]:

:2 [[sodium iodide|NaI]] + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 [[sodium bromide|NaBr]] + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:2 [[potassium iodide|KI]] + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 [[potassium bromide|KBr]] + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Applications==
A wide variety of organobromine compounds are used in [[industry]]. Some are prepared from bromine and others are prepared from [[hydrogen bromide]], which is obtained by burning [[hydrogen]] in bromine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot; /&gt;

Illustrative of the addition reaction&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author = N. A. Khan, F. E. Deatherage, and J. B. Brown|title = Stearolic Acid|collvol = 4|collvolpages = 851| year = 1963|prep = CV4P0851}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the preparation of [[1,2-dibromoethane]], the organobromine compound produced in the largest amounts:
:C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BrCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br

===Flame retardant===
[[Image:Tetrabromobisphenol A.svg|thumb|right|Tetrabromobisphenol A]]

[[Brominated flame retardant]]s represent a commodity of growing importance, and represent the largest use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces [[hydrobromic acid]] which interferes in the radical [[chain reaction]] of the [[oxidation]] reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen oxygen and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid and form less reactive bromine radicals (free bromine atoms). These also react with radicals in the first to help terminate the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Journal of Fire Sciences|volume = 14|page = 426| year = 1996|doi = 10.1177/073490419601400602|title = Mechanisms for Flame Retardancy and Smoke suppression - A Review|first =Joseph|last = Green }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Polymer Degradation and Stability|volume = 77|year = 2002|page = 325| doi = 10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00067-8|title = Fire retardant mechanism of aliphatic bromine compounds in polystyrene and polypropylene|first = Jelle|last = Kaspersma|coauthors = Doumena, Cindy; Munrob Sheilaand; Prinsa, Anne-Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bromine-containing compounds can be placed in the polymers either during [[polymerization]] if a small amount of brominated monomer is added or the bromine containing compound is added after polymerization. [[Tetrabromobisphenol A]] can be added to produce [[polyester]]s or epoxy resins. Epoxy used in [[printed circuit board]]s (PCB) are normally made from flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products ([[FR-4]] and [[FR-2]]. [[Vinyl bromide]] can be used in the production of [[polyethylene]], [[polyvinylchloride]] or [[polypropylene]]. [[Decabromodiphenyl ether]] can be added to the final polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Journal of Fire Sciences|volume = 22|page = 25| year = 2004|doi = 10.1177/0734904104038107|title = A Review of Current Flame Retardant Systems for Epoxy Resins|first = Edward D.|last = Weil|coauthors = Levchik, Sergei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gasoline additive===
[[1,2-Dibromoethane|Ethylene bromide]] was an [[Gasoline additive|additive in gasolines]] containing lead anti-[[engine knocking]] agents. It scavenges lead by forming volatile lead bromide, which is exhausted from the engine. This application accounted for 77% of the bromine use in 1966 in the US. This application has declined since the 1970s due to environmental regulations (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Environment International|volume = 29|year = 2003|page =683| doi = 10.1016/S0160-4120(03)00121-1|title = An overview of commercially used brominated flame retardants, their applications, their use patterns in different countries/regions and possible modes of release|first = Mehran|last = Alaeea|coauthors = Ariasb, Pedro; Sjödinc, Andreas; Bergman, Åke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pesticide===
[[Image:Bromomethane-3D-vdW.png|right|80px |thumb| Methyl bromide (bromomethane)]]
Poisonous [[methyl bromide]] was widely used as [[pesticide]] to [[Fumigation|fumigate]] soil and to fumagate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSYB2007&quot; /&gt; These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as [[ozone depletion]] agents. The [[Montreal Protocol|Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone]] scheduled the phase out for the [[ozone depleting]] chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing fumagation they have been replaced by such compounds as [[sulfuryl fluoride]], which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone). Prior to the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 metric tons of the chemical were used to control [[nematodes]], [[fungi]], [[weed]]s and other soil-borne diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Alternatives to Methyl Bromide for the Control of Soil-Borne Diseases and Pests in California|first = Belinda|last = Messenger|coauthors = Braun, Adolf|year = 2000|publisher = Pest Management Analysis and Planning Program|url = http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/emon/methbrom/alt-anal/sept2000.pdf|accessdate = 2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Economics of the &quot;Critical Use&quot; of Methyl bromide under the Montreal Protocol|doi = 10.1093/cep/byi028|journal =Contemporary Economic Policy|volume = 23|page = 376|year = 2008|first = Stephen J.|last = Decanio|coauthors = Norman, Catherine S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical and veterinary===
{{main|potassium bromide}}
* [[Bromide]] compounds, especially [[potassium bromide]], were frequently used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides in the form of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from country to country. For example, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease, and it was removed from over-the-counter sedative products like [[Bromo-Seltzer]], in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=fd_S2Van52EC&amp;dq=%22The+Great+American+Fraud%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c0jPS5uZFYG0lQfBp-GgCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAw#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title = The Great American fraud}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, bromide levels are not routinely measured by medical laboratories in the U.S. However, U.S. veterinary medical diagnostic testing laboratories will measure blood bromide levels on request, as an aid to treatment of epilepsy in dogs.

* Bromine is also used in the production of [[brominated vegetable oil]], which is used as an [[emulsifier]] in many [[citrus]]-flavored [[soft drinks]] (for example, Mountain Dew).

[[Image:Tralomethrin.png|80px |thumb|right|Tralomethrin]]
* Several [[dye]]s, agrichemicals, and [[pharmaceutical]]s are organobromine compounds. 1-Bromo-3-chloropropane, 1-bromoethylbenzene, and 1-bromoalkanes are prepared by the [[markovnikov rule|antimarkovnikov addition]] of HBr to alkenes. [[Ethidium bromide]], EtBr, is used as a [[DNA]] stain in [[gel electrophoresis]].
* High [[refractive index]] compounds
* Bromine, like chlorine, is used in maintenance of swimming pools, especially spas (hot tubs), where it is generated in situ from a bromide plus hydrogen peroxide. In spas, the high water temperatures render chlorinated water purification and buffering compounds unstable, and bromine compounds may improve the life of the free-halogen antimicrobial.
* [[Water purification]] compounds, [[disinfectants]] and [[insecticide]]s, such as [[tralomethrin]] (C&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSYB2007&quot; /&gt;
* Potassium bromide is used in some photographic developers to inhibit the formation of fog (undesired reduction of silver).
* Bromine vapor is used as the second step in sensitizing [[daguerreotype]] plates to be developed under mercury vapor. Bromine acts as an accelerator to the light sensitivity of the previously iodized plate.
* Bromine is also used to reduce mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants. This can be achieved either by treating [[activated carbon]] with bromine or by injecting bromine compounds onto the coal prior to combustion.

==Biological role==
[[Image:Purpur-mit-Ausfaerbung.png|thumb|right|100px|[[Tyrian purple]]]]

Bromine has no known essential role in human or mammalian health, but inorganic bromine and [[organobromine compound]]s do occur naturally, and some may be of use to higher organisms in dealing with parasites. For example, in the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formed by the [[eosinophil]], and either chloride or bromide ions, eosinophil peroxidase provides a potent mechanism by which eosinophils kill multicellular [[parasitism|parasites]] (such as, for example, the nematode worms involved in [[filariasis]]); and also certain [[bacteria]] (such as [[tuberculosis]] bacteria). Eosinophil peroxidase is a [[haloperoxidase]] that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose, generating [[hypobromite]] ([[hypobromous acid]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2538427&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Mayeno AN, Curran AJ, Roberts RL, Foote CS | title = Eosinophils preferentially use bromide to generate halogenating agents | journal = J.

Marine organisms are the main source of organobromine compounds. Over 1600 compounds were identified by 1999.

Bromine can also be substituted for the methyl substituent in the nitrogenous base thymine of DNA, creating the base analog [[5-bromouracil]].

==Safety==
{{See also|List of highly toxic gases}}

Elemental bromine is toxic and [[Irritant (biology)|causes burns]]. As an [[oxidizing]] agent, it is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Care needs to be taken when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames.

When certain ionic compounds containing bromine are mixed with [[potassium permanganate]] (KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and an acidic substance, they will form a pale brown cloud of bromine gas.

: 6Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 2MnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + 8H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → 3Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

This gas smells like bleach and is very irritating to the mucous membranes. Upon exposure, one should move to fresh air immediately. If symptoms of bromine poisoning arise, medical attention is needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{infobox barium}}
'''Barium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|ɛər|i|əm}} {{respell|BAIR|ee-əm}}) is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Ba''' and [[atomic number]] 56. It is the fifth element in Group 2, a soft silvery [[metal]]lic [[alkaline earth metal]]. Barium is never found in nature in its pure form due to its [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] with [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. Its oxide is historically known as [[Barium hydroxide|baryta]] but it reacts with water and carbon dioxide and is not found as a mineral. The most common naturally occurring minerals are the very insoluble barium sulfate, BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ([[barite]]), and [[barium carbonate]], BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[witherite]]). Barium's name originates from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''barys'' (βαρύς), meaning &quot;heavy&quot;, describing the high density of some common barium-containing ores. 

Barium has few industrial applications, but the metal has been historically used to [[getter|scavenge air]] in [[vacuum tube]]s. Barium compounds impart a green color to flames and have been used in fireworks. [[Barium sulfate]] is used for its density, insolubility, and X-ray opacity. It is used as an insoluble heavy mud-like paste when drilling oil wells, and in purer form, as an X-ray [[radiocontrast agent]] for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract. Soluble barium compounds are poisonous due to release of the soluble barium ion, and have been used as rodenticides. New uses for barium continue to be sought. It is a component of some &quot;high temperature&quot; [[YBCO]] [[superconductors]], and electroceramics.

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Barite.jpg|thumb|Barite|left]]

===Physical properties===
Barium is a soft, silvery white [[alkali earth metal]], which quickly [[oxidation|oxidizes]] in air.&lt;ref name=&quot;A guide to the elements&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=A guide to the elements | author=Stwertka, Albert | year=2002 | publisher=Oxford University Press US | pages=144 | isbn=0195150279}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It crystallizes in [[body centered cubic]] lattices.  It burns with a green to pale green [[flame test|flame]], resulting from [[spectral lines|emission]] at 524.2 and 513.7 nm. Its simple compounds are notable for their relatively high (for an alkaline earth element) [[specific gravity]]. This high density is true of the most common barium-bearing mineral, [[barite]] (BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), also called 'heavy spar' due to the high density (4.5 g/cm³).

===Chemical properties===
Barium, as for other alkali earth (group II) metals, is highly reducing. It reacts exothermically with oxygen at room temperature to form [[barium oxide]] and [[Barium peroxide|peroxide]].  Because of its sensitivity to air, samples are generally stored under protective oils. The reaction is violent if barium is powdered. The metal is readily attacked in most acids, with the notable exception of [[sulfuric acid]], as [[passivation]] stops the reaction by forming the insoluble [[barium sulfate]].  It also reacts violently with water according to the reaction:
: Ba + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Ba(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑

Barium combines with several metals, including aluminium, zinc, lead and tin, forming [[intermetallics|intermetallic phases]] and alloys.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of barium}}
Naturally occurring barium is a mix of seven stable [[isotope]]s, the most abundant being &lt;sup&gt;138&lt;/sup&gt;Ba (71.7 %). 22 isotopes are known, but most of these are highly [[radioactive]] and have [[half-life|half-lives]] in the several millisecond to several day range. The only notable exceptions are &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Ba which has a half-life of 10.51 years, and &lt;sup&gt;137m&lt;/sup&gt;Ba (2.55 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = David R. Lide, Norman E. Holden|title =CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 85th Edition| publisher = CRC Press|location = Boca Raton, Florida|year =2005| chapter = Section 11, Table of the Isotopes}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Ba is a standard calibrant for [[gamma-ray]] detectors in nuclear physics studies.

===Occurrence===
The abundance of barium is 0.0425 % in the Earth's crust and 13&amp;nbsp;µg/L in sea water. It occurs in the minerals barite (as the sulfate) and witherite (as the carbonate).&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Although witherite deposits were mined from the 17th century till 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=JjEmAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Settlingstones+Witherite+Mine&amp;q=Settlingstones+#search_anchor | page = 28 | title = Industrial minerals | year = 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; in northern England, for example in the Settlingstones Mine near [[Newbrough]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rock-site.co.uk/EZ/rs/rs/page151.php | title = Alston Moor   Cumbria,  UK| publisher = Steetley Minerals}}&lt;/ref&gt; today nearly all barium is mined as barite.

Large deposits of barite are found in [[China]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Morocco]], and in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CRC&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = C. R.

A rare gem containing barium is known, called [[benitoite]].

==Production==
[[Image:BariteWorldProductionUSGS.PNG|thumb|left|Trend in world production of barite]]
Because barium quickly oxidizes in air, it is difficult to obtain the free metal and it is never found free in nature. The metal is primarily found in, and extracted from, barite. Because barite is so insoluble, it cannot be used directly for the preparation of other barium compounds, or barium metal. Instead, the ore is heated with [[carbon]] to reduce it to [[barium sulfide]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Toxicological Profile for Barium and Barium Compounds. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry| publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]| date = 2007.| url = http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp24.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 C → BaS + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The barium sulfide is then [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] or treated with acids to form other barium compounds, such as the [[Barium chloride|chloride]], [[Barium nitrate|nitrate]], and carbonate.

Barium is commercially produced through the [[electrolysis]] of molten barium chloride (BaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):

:([[cathode]]) Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2 {{SubatomicParticle|electron}} → Ba
:([[anode]]) 2 Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;   →   Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 {{SubatomicParticle|electron}}

Barium metal is also obtained by the reduction of barium oxide with finely divided [[aluminium]] at temperatures between 1100 and 1200 °C:
: 4 BaO + 2 Al → BaO·Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 Ba

The barium vapor is cooled and condensed to give the solid metal, which can be cast into rods or extruded into wires. Being a flammable solid, it is packaged under [[argon]] in steel containers or plastic bags.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

==Compounds==
Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is the dominant [[oxidation state]] throughout the chemistry of barium. Its properties generally resemble those of other alkaline earth ions such as strontium and calcium. All halides, pseudohalides and chalcogenides are known, usually as colourless solids. The sulfate is famously insoluble. BaO forms a peroxide when heated in air. The oxide is basic and reacts with acids to give salts. 
Barium reduces oxides, chlorides and sulfides of less active metals. For example:
:Ba + CdO → BaO + Cd
:Ba + ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → BaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Zn
:3 Ba + Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 BaS + 2 Al

At elevated temperatures, barium combines with [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] to produce the [[nitride]] Ba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[hydride]] BaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. When heated with nitrogen and carbon, it forms the cyanide:
: Ba + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 C → Ba(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==History==
Barium's name originates from Greek ''βαρύς'' ''barys'', meaning &quot;heavy&quot;, describing the density of some common barium-containing ores. Alchemists in the early Middle Ages knew about some barium minerals. Smooth pebble-like stones of mineral barite found in [[Bologna]], [[Italy]] were known as &quot;Bologna stones&quot;. The fact that after exposed to light, they would glow for years, attracted witches and alchemists to them.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; 

[[Carl Scheele]] identified barite as containing a new element in 1774, but could not isolate barium, only [[barium oxide]].  [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] also isolated [[barium oxide]] two years later in similar studies.  Oxidized barium was at first called barote, by [[Guyton de Morveau]], a name which was changed by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] to ''baryta.''  Also in the 18th century, English mineralogist [[William Withering]] noted a heavy mineral in the lead mines of [[cumberland]], now known to be [[Witherite]]. Barium was first isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts in 1808, by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Davy, H. (1808) &quot;[http://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Electro-chemical researches on the decomposition of  the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia],&quot; ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', vol. 98, pages 333-370.&lt;/ref&gt; Davy, by analogy with [[calcium]] named &quot;barium&quot; after baryta, with the &quot;-ium&quot; ending signifying a metallic element.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book| page = 80| url = http://books.google.com/?id=yb9xTj72vNAC| title = The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide| author = Robert E. Krebs| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2006| isbn = 0313334382}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Augustus Matthiessen]] yielded pure barium by electrolysis of a molten mixture of barium chlorid and ammonium chlorid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18550930301 | title = Masthead | year = 1855 | journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie | volume = 93 | issue = 3 | pages = fmi–fmi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =10.1002/prac.18560670194 | title =Notizen | year =1856 | last1 =Wagner | first1 =Rud. | last2 =Neubauer | first2 =C. | last3 =Deville | first3 =H.

The production of pure oxygen in the [[Brin process]] was a large scale application of barium peroxide before electrolysis and [[fractional distillation|fractionally distill]] liquefied air became the dominant ways to produce oxygen. In this process the barium oxide reacts at 500–600°C with air to form barium peroxide which decomposes at above 700°C by releasing oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = William B. | title = The Origin of the Brin Process for the Manufacture of Oxygen | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 86 | pages = 1266 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1021/ed086p1266 | issue = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&amp;pg=PA681 | page = 681 | title = The development of modern chemistry | isbn = 9780486642352 | author1 = Ihde, Aaron John | date = 1984-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[Image:BariumXray.jpg|thumb|[[Amoebiasis]] as seen in radiograph of barium-filled colon]]
[[Image:2006 Fireworks 1.JPG|thumb|Green barium fireworks]]
The dominating application of elemental barium is as a scavenger or “[[getter]]” removing the last traces of oxygen and other gases in electronic [[vacuum tubes]] such as television [[cathode ray tubes]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Robert Kresse, Ulrich Baudis, Paul Jäger, H. Hermann Riechers, Heinz Wagner, Jochen Winkler, Hans Uwe Wolf, &quot;Barium and Barium Compounds&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2007 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a03_325.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alloy of barium with [[nickel]] is commonly used in automobile ignitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Occ Safety&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Encyclopaedia of Occupational Health and Safety: Chemical, industries and occupations | author=Stellman, Jeanne | year=1998 | publisher=International Labour Organization | pages=63.8 | isbn=9789221098164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications of barium sulfate===
Barium sulfate (the mineral barite, BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is important to the petroleum industry, for example, as [[drilling mud]], a weighting agent in drilling new [[oil well]]s.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; It is also a filler in a variety of products such as rubber. Taking advantage of its opacity to X-rays, the sulfate is used as a [[radiocontrast]] agent for [[medical imaging|X-ray imaging]] of the digestive system (&quot;[[barium meal]]s&quot; and &quot;[[Lower gastrointestinal series|barium enema]]s&quot;).&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; [[Lithopone]], a [[pigment]] that contains barium sulfate and [[zinc sulfide]], is a permanent white that has good covering power, and does not darken when exposed to sulfides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page = 102| url = http://books.google.com/?id=uEJHsZWyO-EC| title= Medicinal applications of coordination chemistry| author = Chris J. Jones, John Thornback| publisher =Royal Society of Chemistry| year = 2007| isbn =0854045961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications of other barium compounds===
Aside from the sulfate, other compounds of barium find only niche applications. Applications are limited by the toxicity of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (Barium carbonate is a [[rat poison]]), which is not a problem for the insoluble BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
*[[Barium oxide]] is used in a coating for the [[electrode]]s of [[fluorescent lamp]]s, which facilitates the release of [[electron]]s.
*[[Barium carbonate]] is also used in [[glass]]making. Being a heavy element, barium increases the [[refractive index]] and luster of the glass.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;
*Barium, commonly as [[barium nitrate]], is used to give green colors in fireworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page =110| url = http://books.google.com/?id=yxRyOf8jFeQC| title = Chemistry of Fireworks| author = Michael S. Russell, Kurt Svrcula| publisher= Royal Society of Chemistry| year = 2008| isbn = 0854041273}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species responsible for the brilliant green is barium monochloride; in the absence of a source of chlorine a yellow or &quot;apple&quot; green is produced instead.
*[[Barium peroxide]] can be used as a catalyst to start an [[aluminothermic reaction]] when welding rail tracks together. It can also be used in green [[tracer ammunition]] and as a bleaching agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi =10.1002/prep.19950200604| title =Surfactant coatings for the stabilization of barium peroxide and lead dioxide in pyrotechnic compositions| year =1995| author =Brent, G. F.| journal =Propellants Explosives Pyrotechnics| volume =20| pages =300| last2 =Harding| first2 =M. D.| issue =6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Barium titanate]] is a promising [[electroceramic]].
*[[Barium fluoride]] is used for optics in infrared applications, since it is transparent from about 0.15 to 12&amp;nbsp;micrometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crystran.co.uk/barium-fluoride-baf2.htm |title=Crystran Ltd. Optical Component Materials |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- *The ratio of barium (biogenic barium) to aluminium  within marine cores is used as a proxy for surface ocean export production in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0025-3227(04)00004-0 | title = Biogenic barium and the detrital Ba/Al ratio: a comparison of their direct and indirect determination | year = 2004 | last1 = Reitz | first1 = A | journal = Marine Geology | volume = 204 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 289–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Precautions==
[[Soluble]] barium compounds are [[poison]]ous. At low doses, barium acts as a muscle stimulant, whereas higher doses affect the [[nervous system]], causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, [[Muscle weakness|weakness]], [[anxiety]], [[dyspnea]] and [[paralysis]]. This may be due to its ability to block [[potassium ion channels]] which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages = 77–78| isbn = 0070494398 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC&amp;pg=PA243 |title = Handbook of inorganic chemicals |author1 = Patnaik, Pradyot |year = 2003}}--&lt;/ref&gt; However, individual responses to barium salts vary widely, with some being able to handle barium nitrate casually without problems, and others becoming ill from working with it in small quantities. For example, [[barium acetate]] was used by Marie Robards to poison her father in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.buffalo.edu/news/pdf/October08/DallanMorningNewsEwingSlaying.pdf| title = Boyfriend fight preceded Roanoke mom's slaying| accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-toxicity of barium sulfate===
Because it is highly insoluble in water as well as stomach acids, barium sulfate can be taken [[mouth|oral]]ly. It is eliminated completely from the digestive tract. Unlike other [[heavy metals]], barium does not [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.epa.gov/region5/superfund/ecology/html/toxprofiles.htm#ba| accessdate = 2009-06-06| title = Toxicity Profiles, Ecological Risk Assessment|publisher = US EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Moore, J. W.|year =1991| title = Inorganic Contaminants of Surface Waters, Research and Monitoring Priorities| publisher = Springer-Verlag| location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, inhaled dust containing barium compounds can accumulate in the lungs, causing a [[benign]] condition called [[baritosis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1257935&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doig AT |title=Baritosis: a benign pneumoconiosis |journal=Thorax |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=30–9 |year=1976 |month=February |pmid=1257935 |pmc=470358 |doi= 10.1136/thx.31.1.30|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{infobox berkelium}}
'''Berkelium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|b|ər|ˈ|k|iː|l|i|.|əm}} {{respell|bər|KEE|lee-əm}}, less commonly {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|k|l|i|.|əm}} {{respell|BURK|lee-əm}}), is a [[synthetic element]] with the symbol '''Bk''' and [[atomic number]] 97, a member of the [[actinide]] and [[transuranium element]] series. It is named after the city of [[Berkeley, California]], the location of the [[University of California Radiation Laboratory]] where it was discovered in December 1949. This was the fifth transuranium element discovered after [[neptunium]], [[plutonium]], [[curium]] and [[americium]].

The major [[isotope]] of berkelium, berkelium-249, is synthesized in minute quantities in dedicated high-flux [[nuclear reactor]]s, mainly at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Tennessee]], USA, and at the [[Research Institute of Atomic Reactors]] in [[Dimitrovgrad, Russia]]. The production of the second-important isotope berkelium-247 involves the irradiation of the rare synthetic isotope [[curium-244]] with high-energy [[alpha particle]]s.

Just over one gram of berkelium has been produced at in the United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside of scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier [[transuranic elements]] and [[transactinide]]s. A 22&amp;nbsp;milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the element [[ununseptium]] for the first time in 2009 at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]], [[Russia]], after it was bombarded with [[calcium-48]] ions for 150 days. This was a culmination of the Russia—US collaboration on the synthesis of elements 113 to 118.

Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, [[Radioactivity|radioactive]] metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy [[electron]]s and thus is relatively safe to handle. However, it decays with a [[half-life]] of 330&amp;nbsp;days to [[californium]]-249, which is a strong and hazardous emitter of alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also self-radiation damage, and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.

==History==
[[File:Berkeley 60-inch cyclotron.gif|thumb|left|upright|The 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, in August 1939|alt=Black-and-white picture of heavy machinery with two operators sitting aside]]

Although very small amounts of berkelium were possibly produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was [[discoveries of the chemical elements|first intentionally synthesized]], isolated and identified in December 1949 by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], [[Albert Ghiorso]] and [[Stanley G. Thompson]]. They used the 60-inch [[cyclotron]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Similar to the nearly simultaneous discovery of [[americium]] (element 95) and [[curium]] (element 96) in 1944, the new elements berkelium and [[californium]] (element 98) were both produced in 1949–1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=S.|last2=Ghiorso|first2=A.|last3=Seaborg|first3=G.|title=Element 97|journal=Physical Review|volume=77|pages=838|year=1950|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.77.838.2|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;E97&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=S.|last2=Ghiorso|first2=A.|last3=Seaborg|first3=G.|title=The New Element Berkelium (Atomic Number 97)|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.80.781|year=1950|pages=781|volume=80|journal=Physical Review|url=http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/documents/fullText/ACC0045.pdf|issue=5}} [http://www.osti.gov/cgi-bin/rd_accomplishments/display_biblio.cgi?id=ACC0045&amp;numPages=38&amp;fp=N Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=c1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2172/932812|last1=Thompson|year=1950|first1=Stanley G.|last2=Seaborg|first2=Glenn T.|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/932812-Rk9Mcq/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=S.

The name choice for element 97 followed the previous tradition of the Californian group to draw an analogy between the newly discovered [[actinide]] and the [[lanthanide]] element positioned above it in the [[periodic table]]. Previously, americium was named after a continent as its analogue [[europium]], and curium honored scientists [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] as the lanthanide above it, [[gadolinium]], was named after the explorer of the [[rare earth element]]s [[Johan Gadolin]]. Thus the discovery report by the Berkeley group reads: &quot;It is suggested that element 97 be given the name berkelium (symbol Bk) after the city of Berkeley in a manner similar to that used in naming its chemical homologue [[terbium]] (atomic number 65) whose name was derived from the town of [[Ytterby]], [[Sweden]], where the rare earth minerals were first found.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;E97&quot;/&gt; This tradition ended on berkelium though as the naming of the next discovered actinide, [[californium]], was not related to its lanthanide analogue [[dysprosium]], but after the discovery place.

The most difficult steps in the synthesis of berkelium were its separation from the final products and the production of sufficient quantities of americium for the target material. First, americium (&lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am) [[nitrate]] solution was coated on a [[platinum]] foil, the solution was evaporated and the residue converted by annealing to americium dioxide (AmO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This target was irradiated with 35&amp;nbsp;MeV [[alpha particle]]s for 6 hours in the 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley. The (α,2n) reaction induced by the irradiation yielded the &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Bk isotope and two free [[neutron]]s:&lt;ref name=&quot;E97&quot;/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{241}_{\ 95}Am\ +\ ^{4}_{2}He\ \longrightarrow \ ^{243}_{\ 97}Bk\ +\ 2\ ^{1}_{0}n}&lt;/math&gt;

After the irradiation, the coating was dissolved with [[nitric acid]] and then precipitated as the [[hydroxide]] using concentrated aqueous [[ammonium hydroxide|ammonia solution]]. The product was [[centrifugation|centrifugated]] and re-dissolved in nitric acid. To separate berkelium from the unreacted americium, this solution was added to a mixture of [[ammonium]] and [[ammonium sulfate]] and heated to convert all the dissolved americium into the [[oxidation state]] +6. Unoxidized residual americium was precipitated by the addition of [[hydrofluoric acid]] as americium(III) [[fluoride]] ({{chem|AmF|3}}). This step yielded a mixture of the accompanying product curium and the expected element 97 in form of trifluorides. The mixture was converted to the corresponding hydroxides by treating it with [[potassium hydroxide]], and after centrifugation, was dissolved in [[perchloric acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;E97&quot;/&gt;

Further separation was carried out in the presence of a [[citric acid]]/[[ammonium]] [[buffer solution]] in a weakly acidic medium ([[pH]]≈3.5), using [[ion exchange]] at elevated temperature. The [[chromatography|chromatographic]] separation behavior was then unknown for the element 97, but was anticipated by analogy with terbium (see elution curves). First results were disappointing as no alpha-particle emission signature could be detected from the elution product. Only the further search for [[K-alpha|characteristic X-rays]] and [[Internal conversion|conversion electron]] signals resulted in the identification of a berkelium isotope. Its atomic number was uncertain between 243 and 244 in the initial report,&lt;ref name=c1/&gt; but was later established as 243.&lt;ref name = &quot;E97&quot;/&gt;

Berkelium is a synthetic, silvery-white, radioactive [[actinide]] metal. In the [[periodic table]], it is located right to the actinide [[curium]], left to the actinide [[californium]] and below the lanthanide [[terbium]] with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;lies between those of curium (13.52&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and californium (15.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), as does its melting point of 986 °C, below that of curium (1340&amp;nbsp;°C) but higher than that of californium (900&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest [[bulk modulus|bulk moduli]] among the actinides, at about 20 [[pascal|GPa]] (2{{e|10}}Pa).&lt;ref name=pressure/&gt;

Berkelium(III) ions shows two sharp [[fluorescence]] peaks at 652&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer]]s (red light) and 742&amp;nbsp;nanometers (deep red – near infrared) due to internal transitions at the [[Electron configuration|f-electron shell]]. The relative intensity of these peaks depends on the excitation power and temperature of the sample. This emission can be observed, for example, after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass, by melting the glass in presence of berkelium oxide or halide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Assefa|first1=Z.|last2=Haire|first2=R.G.|last3=Stump|first3=N.A.|title=Emission profile of Bk(III) in a silicate matrix: anomalous dependence on excitation power|journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds|volume=271-273|pages=854|year=1998|doi=10.1016/S0925-8388(98)00233-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rita Cornelis, Joe Caruso, Helen Crews, Klaus Heumann [http://books.google.com/books?id=1PmjurlE6KkC&amp;pg=PA553 Handbook of elemental speciation II: species in the environment, food, medicine &amp; occupational health.

Between 70&amp;nbsp;K and room temperature, berkelium behaves as a [[Curie–Weiss law|Curie–Weiss]] paramagnetic material with an effective magnetic moment of 9.69&amp;nbsp;[[Bohr magneton]]s (µ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;) and a [[Curie temperature]] of 101&amp;nbsp;K. This magnetic moment is almost equal to the theoretical value of 9.72&amp;nbsp;µ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; calculated within the simple atomic [[Angular momentum coupling|L-S coupling model]]. Upon cooling to about 34&amp;nbsp;K, berkelium undergoes a transition to an[[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] state.{{sfn|Peterson|1984|p=45}} [[Enthalpy change of solution|Enthalpy of dissolution]] in [[hydrochloric acid]] at standard conditions is −600&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, from which the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation (data table)|standard enthalpy change of formation]](Δ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''H''°) of aqueous Bk&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions is obtained as −601&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[standard potential]] Bk&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Bk&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is −2.01&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuger|first1=J|title=A new determination of the enthalpy of solution of berkelium metal and the standard enthalpy of formation of Bk3+ (aq)|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=43|pages=3209|year=1981|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(81)80090-5|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ionization energy|ionization potential]] of a neutral berkelium atom is 6.23&amp;nbsp;eV.{{sfn|Peterson|1984|p=34}}

===Allotropes===
At ambient conditions, berkelium assumes its most stable α form which has a [[hexagonal]] symmetry, [[space group]] ''P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/mmc'', lattice parameters of 341&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]] and 1107&amp;nbsp;pm. The crystal has a double-[[Close-packing of spheres|hexagonal close packing]] structure with the layer sequence ABAC and so is [[isotypic]] with α-lanthanum and α-forms of actinides beyond curium.&lt;ref name = &quot;Peterson&quot; /&gt; This crystal structure changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 7&amp;nbsp;GPa, α-berkelium transforms to the beta modification, which has a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (''fcc'') symmetry and space group ''Fm{{overline|3}}m''. This transition occurs without change in volume, but the [[enthalpy]] increases by 3.66 kJ/mol.{{sfn|Peterson|1984|p=44}} Upon further compression to 25&amp;nbsp;GPa, berkelium transforms to an [[Orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic]] γ-berkelium structure similar to that of α-uranium. This transition is accompanied by a 12% volume decrease and delocalization of the electrons at the [[electron shell|5f electron shell]].&lt;ref name=pressure2/&gt; No further phase transitions are observed up to 57 GPa.&lt;ref name=pressure&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benedict|first1=U|title=Study of actinide metals and actinide compounds under high pressures|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=100|pages=153|year=1984|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(84)90061-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, David A.

Upon heating, α-berkelium transforms into another &quot;metastable&quot; phase (that is at ambient temperature it gradually converts back to α-berkelium). This phase has an ''fcc'' lattice (but slightly different from β-berkelium), space group ''Fm{{overline|3}}m'' and the lattice constant of 500&amp;nbsp;pm; this ''fcc'' structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence ABC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson&quot;/&gt; The temperature of the phase transition is believed to be quite close to the melting point.&lt;ref name=&quot;H&amp;P&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fahey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Fahey|first1 = J.

===Chemical===
Like all [[actinide]]s, berkelium dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous [[hydrogen]] and converting into the berkelium(III) state. This trivalent [[oxidation state]] is the most stable, especially in aqueous solutions, but tetravalent and possibly divalent berkelium compounds are also known. The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed [[lanthanum chloride]]-[[strontium chloride]] melts.{{sfn|Peterson|1984|p=55}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=Jim C.|last2=Schmidt|first2=K.

However, it reacts with molten metals, [[hydrogen]], [[halogen]]s, [[chalcogen]]s and [[pnictogen]]s to form various binary compounds.{{sfn|Peterson|1984|p=45}}&lt;ref name=&quot;H&amp;P&quot;/&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of berkelium}}
About twenty isotopes and six [[nuclear isomer]]s (excited states of an isotope) of berkelium have been characterized with the atomic numbers ranging from 235 to 254. All of them are radioactive. The longest [[half-life|half-lives]] are observed for &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Bk (1,380&amp;nbsp;years), &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Bk (9 years) and &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk (330&amp;nbsp;days); the half-lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The isotope which is the easiest to synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft [[Beta decay|β-particles]] which are inconvenient for detection. Its [[alpha radiation]] is rather weak – 1.45{{e|-3}}% with respect to the β-radiation – but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter as most actinide isotopes.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBE&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = B. Myasoedov ''et al.''|title = Analytical chemistry of transplutonium elements| place =Moscow|publisher = Nauka|year = 1972|isbn = 0470627158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audi|first1=G|doi=10.1016/S0375-9474(97)00482-X|title=The N? evaluation of nuclear and decay properties|year=1997|pages=1|volume=624|journal=Nuclear Physics A|url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occurrence===
The longest-lived isotope of berkelium (&lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Bk) has a half-life of only 1,380 years. Therefore, all [[Primordial nuclide|primordial]] berkelium, that is berkelium present on the Earth during its formation, should have decayed by now. On Earth, berkelium is mostly concentrated in certain areas, which were used for the atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons tests]] between 1945 and 1980, as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents, such as [[Chernobyl disaster]], [[Three Mile Island accident]] and [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash]]. So the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. [[hydrogen bomb]], [[Ivy Mike]], (1 November 1952, [[Enewetak Atoll]]), revealed high concentrations of various actinides, including berkelium. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fields|first1=P.|last2=Studier|first2=M.|last3=Diamond|first3=H.|last4=Mech|first4=J.|last5=Inghram|first5=M.|last6=Pyle|first6=G.|last7=Stevens|first7=C.|last8=Fried|first8=S.|last9=Manning|first9=W.|title=Transplutonium Elements in Thermonuclear Test Debris|journal=Physical Review|volume=102|pages=180|year=1956|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.102.180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear reactors produce mostly, among the berkelium isotopes, berkelium-249. During the storage and before the fuel disposal, most of it breaks down to californium-249. The latter has a long half-life, of 351 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/|author = NNDC contributors

Sonzogni (Database Manager)|title = Chart of Nuclides|publisher = National Nuclear Data Center, [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]|accessdate = 2010-03-01|year = 2008|location = Upton, New York|ref = CITEREFNNDC2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is therefore undesirable in the disposal products.

==Synthesis and extraction==
===Preparation of isotopes===
[[File:HFIR Aerial.jpg|thumb|right|The [[High Flux Isotope Reactor]] at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is one of the places where berkelium is produced|alt=A complex of buildings in the middle of a forest]]
Berkelium is produced by bombarding lighter actinides [[uranium]] (&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U) or [[plutonium]] (&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu) with neutrons in a [[nuclear reactor]]. In a more common case of uranium fuel, plutonium is produced first by neutron capture (the so-called (n,γ) reaction or neutron fusion) followed by beta-decay:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=S.|last2=Ghiorso|first2=A.|last3=Harvey|first3=B.|last4=Choppin|first4=G.|title=Transcurium Isotopes Produced in the Neutron Irradiation of Plutonium|journal=Physical Review|volume=93|pages=908|year=1954|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.93.908|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{238}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{239}_{\ 92}U\ \xrightarrow [23.5 \ min]{\beta^-} \ ^{239}_{\ 93}Np\ \xrightarrow [2.3565 \ d]{\beta^-} \ ^{239}_{\ 94}Pu}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;small&gt;(the times are [[half-life|half-lives]])&lt;/small&gt;

Plutonium-239 is further irradiated by a source that has a high [[neutron flux]],several times higher than a conventional nuclear reactor, such as the 85-megawatt [[High Flux Isotope Reactor]] (HFIR) at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in Tennessee, USA. The higher flux promotes fusion reactions involving not one but several neutrons, converting &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu to &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and then to &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cm:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{239}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow {4(n,\gamma)} \ ^{243}_{\ 94}Pu\ \xrightarrow [4.956 \ h]{\beta^-} \ ^{243}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow {(n,\gamma)} \ ^{244}_{\ 95}Am\ \xrightarrow [10.1 \ h]{\beta^-} \ ^{244}_{\ 96}Cm} \quad; \quad \mathrm{^{244}_{\ 96}Cm\ \xrightarrow {5(n,\gamma)} \ ^{249}_{\ 96}Cm}&lt;/math&gt;

Curium-249 has a short half-life of 64 minutes, and thus its further conversion to &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cm has a low probability. Instead, it transforms by beta-decay into &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk:&lt;ref name=&quot;nubase&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{^{249}_{\ 96}Cm\ \xrightarrow [64.15 \ min]{\beta^-} \ ^{249}_{\ 97}Bk\ \xrightarrow [330 \ d]{\beta^-} \ ^{249}_{\ 98}Cf}&lt;/math&gt;

The thus-produced &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk has a long half-life of 330 days and thus can capture another neutron. However, the product, &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Bk, again has a relatively short half-life of 3.212 hours and thus, does not yield higher actinides.

The above reactions illustrate that although &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Bk is the most stable isotope of berkelium, its production in nuclear reactors is very inefficient. This makes &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk the most accessible isotope of berkelium, which still, is available only in small quantities (only 0.66&amp;nbsp;grams have been produced in the US over the period 1967–1983{{sfn|Peterson|1984|p=30}}) at a high price of the order 185 [[United States dollar|USD]] per microgram.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;Hammond C.

The isotope &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Bk was first obtained in 1956 by bombarding a mixture of curium isotopes with 25 MeV α-particles. Although its direct detection was hindered by strong signal interference with &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Bk, the existence of a new isotope was proven by the growth of the decay product &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cf which had been previously characterized.

Berkelium-242 was synthesized in 1979 by bombarding &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U with &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B, &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U with &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B, &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th with &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N or &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th with &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N.

===Separation===
The fact that berkelium readily assumes [[oxidation state]] +4 in solids, and is relatively stable in this state in liquids greatly assists separation of berkelium away from many other actinides. These are inevitably produced in relatively large amounts during the nuclear synthesis and often favor the +3 state. This fact was not yet known in the initial experiments, which used a more complex separation procedure. Various oxidation agents can be applied to the berkelium(III) solutions to convert it to the +4 state, such as [[bromate]]s (BrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;), [[bismuthate]]s (BiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;), [[chromate]]s (CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; and Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;), silver(I) thiolate ({{chem|Ag|2|S|2|O|8}}), lead(IV) oxide (PbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[ozone]] ({{chem|O|3}}), or photochemical oxidation procedures. Berkelium(IV) is then extracted with [[ion exchange]], extraction [[chromatography]] or liquid-liquid extraction using HDEHP (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric scid), [[amine]]s, [[tributyl phosphate]] or various other reagents. These procedures separate berkelium from most trivalent actinides and lanthanides, except for the lanthanide [[cerium]] (lanthanides are absent in the irradiation target but are created in various [[nuclear fission]] decay chains).{{sfn|Peterson|1984|p=32}}

A more detailed procedure adopted at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using [[lithium chloride]] reagent, then precipitated as [[hydroxide]]s, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure [[elution]] from [[Ion exchange|cation exchange]] resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted using one of the procedures described above.{{sfn|Peterson|1984|p=32}} Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment.{{sfn|Peterson|1984|pp=33–34}}

===Bulk metal preparation===
In order to characterize chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium and its compounds, a program was initiated in 1952 at the [[Idaho National Laboratory|Material Testing Reactor]], [[Arco, Idaho]], US. It resulted in preparation of an eight-gram plutonium-239 target and in the first production of macroscopic quantities (0.6&amp;nbsp;micrograms) of berkelium by [[Burris B. Cunningham]] and [[Stanley G. Thompson]] in 1958, after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years.{{sfn|Peterson|1984|p=30}}&lt;ref&gt;S. G.

Berkelium(IV) fluoride (BkF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a yellow-green ionic solid which crystallizes in the [[monoclinic crystal system]] and is isotypic with [[uranium tetrafluoride]] or [[zirconium(IV) fluoride]].{{sfn|Peterson|1984|p=48}}&lt;ref name=&quot;BKF_3_4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keenan|first1=Thomas K.|last2=Asprey|first2=Larned B.|title=Lattice constants of actinide tetrafluorides including berkelium|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=8|pages=235|year=1969|doi=10.1021/ic50072a011|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 22&amp;nbsp;milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared in a 250-day irradiation and then purified for 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This target yielded the first 6 atoms of element [[ununseptium]] at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR), [[Dubna]], Russia, after bombarding it with calcium ions in the U400 cyclotron for 150 days. This synthesis was a culmination of the Russia—US collaboration between JINR and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] on the synthesis of elements 113 to 118 which was initiated in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://str.llnl.gov/OctNov10/shaughnessy.html Collaboration Expands the Periodic Table, One Element at a Time], Science and Technology Review, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, October/November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100406181611.htm Nuclear Missing Link Created at Last: Superheavy Element 117], Science daily, 7 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear fuel cycle==
The [[nuclear fission]] properties of berkelium are different from those of the neighboring actinides curium and californium, and they suggest berkelium to perform poorly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor. Specifically, berkelium-249 has a moderately large neutron capture [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]] of 710 [[barn (unit)|barns]] for [[thermal neutrons]], 1200 barns [[resonance integral]], but very low fission cross section for thermal neutrons. In a thermal reactor, much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium-250 which quickly decays to californium-250.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pfennig, H. Klewe-Nebenius, W.

Its [[critical mass]] is relatively high at 192&amp;nbsp;kg; it can be reduced with a water or steel reflector but would still exceed the world production of this isotope.&lt;ref name=&quot;irsn&quot;&gt;Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire: [http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/transport/doc/irsn_sect03_146.pdf &quot;Evaluation of nuclear criticality safety. data and limits for actinides in transport&quot;], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkelium-247 can maintain chain reaction both in a thermal-neutron and in a fast-neutron reactor, however, its production is rather complex and thus the availability is much lower than its critical mass, which is about 75.7&amp;nbsp;kg for a bare sphere, 41.2&amp;nbsp;kg with a water reflector and 35.2&amp;nbsp;kg with a steel reflector (30&amp;nbsp;cm thickness).&lt;ref name=&quot;irsn&quot;/&gt;

==Health issues==
Little is known about the effects of berkelium on human body, and analogies with other elements may not be drawn because of different radiation products (electrons for berkelium and alpha particles and/or neutrons for most other actinides). The low energy of electrons emitted from berkelium-249 (less than 126 keV) hinders its detection, due to signal interference with other decay processes, but also makes this isotope relatively harmless to humans as compared to other actinides. However, berkelium-249 transforms with a half-life of only 330 days to the strong alpha-emitter californium-249, which is rather dangerous and has to be handled in a [[glove box]] in a dedicated laboratory.

Most available berkelium toxicity data originate from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% berkelium ends in the blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50&amp;nbsp;years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20&amp;nbsp;years), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries where berkelium stays indefinitely. The balance of about 10% is excreted.&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Radiological Protection [http://books.google.com/books?id=WTxcCV4w0VEC&amp;pg=PA14 Limits for intakes of radionuclides by workers, Part 4, Volume 19, Issue 4], Elsevier Health Sciences, ISBN, 0080368867 p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In all these organs berkelium might promote cancer, and in the [[skeletal system]] its radiation can damage red blood cells. The maximum permissible body burden for the isotope berkelium-249 in the human skeleton is 0.4&amp;nbsp;nanograms.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pradyot Patnaik.

'''Bauxite''' is an [[aluminium]] [[ore]] and is the main provider of aluminium. This form of rock consists mostly of the [[mineral]]s [[gibbsite]] Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, [[boehmite]] γ-AlO(OH), and [[diaspore]] α-AlO(OH), in a [[mixture]] with the two [[iron oxide]]s [[goethite]] and [[hematite]], the clay mineral [[kaolinite]], and small amounts of [[anatase]] TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Bauxite was named after the village [[Les Baux-de-Provence|Les Baux]] in southern [[France]], where it was first recognised as containing aluminium and named by the French geologist [[Pierre Berthier]] in 1821.

==Bauxite formation==
                          
Lateritic bauxites (silicate bauxites) are distinguished from [[karst]] bauxite ores (carbonate bauxites). The early discovered carbonate bauxites occur predominantly in [[Europe]] and [[Jamaica]] above [[carbonate rock]]s ([[limestone]] and [[dolomite]]), where they were formed by lateritic [[weathering]] and residual accumulation of intercalated [[clay]]s or by clay dissolution residues of the limestone.

The lateritic bauxites are found mostly in the countries of the [[tropics]].They were formed by lateritization (see [[laterite]]) of various [[Silicate#Silicate rock|silicate rocks]] such as [[granite]], [[gneiss]], [[basalt]], [[syenite]], and [[shale]]. In comparison with the iron-rich laterites, the formation of bauxites demands even more intense weathering conditions in a location with very good drainage. This enables the dissolution of the kaolinite and the precipitation of the gibbsite. Zones with highest aluminium content are frequently located below a [[ferruginous]] surface layer. The [[aluminium hydroxide]] in the lateritic bauxite deposits is almost exclusively gibbsite.

==Production trends==
[[Image:2005bauxite.png|thumb|right|Bauxite output in 2005]]

In 2007, [[Australia]] was one of the top producers of bauxite with almost one-third of the world's production, followed by China, Brazil, Guinea, and India. Although aluminium demand is rapidly increasing, known reserves of its bauxite ore are sufficient to meet the worldwide demands for aluminium for many centuries. Increased [[aluminium recycling]], which has the advantage of lowering the cost in [[electric power]] in producing aluminium, will considerably extend the world's bauxite reserves.

In November 2010, [[Nguyen Tan Dung]], the prime minister of [[Vietnam]], announced that Vietnam's bauxite reserves might total 11000Mt; this would be the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mining-journal.com/exploration--and--development/vietnams-bauxite-reserves-may-total-11-billion-tonnes|accessdate=2010-11-28|title=Mining Journal - Vietnam’s bauxite reserves may total 11 billion tonnes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing==

[[Image:CaboRojoDRBauxite.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Bauxite being loaded at Cabo Rojo, Dominican Republic, to be shipped elsewhere for processing; 2007]]

Bauxite is usually [[surface mining|strip mined]] because it is almost always found near the surface of the terrain, with little or no [[overburden]]. Approximately 95% of the world's bauxite production is processed first into [[alumina]], and then into aluminium by [[electrolysis]]. Bauxite rocks are typically classified according to their intended commercial application: metallurgical, abrasive, cement, chemical, and refractory.

Usually, bauxite ore is heated in a pressure vessel along with a [[sodium hydroxide]] solution at a temperature of 150 to 200 [[Celsius]]. At these temperatures, the [[aluminium]] is dissolved as an aluminate (the [[Bayer process]]). After separation of ferruginous residue ([[red mud]]) by filtering, pure gibbsite is precipitated when the liquid is cooled, and then seeded with fine-grained aluminium hydroxide. The gibbsite is usually converted into [[aluminium oxide]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, by heating. This mineral becomes molten at a temperature of about 1000 Celsius, when the mineral [[cryolite]] is added as a flux. Next, this molten substance can yield metallic aluminium by passing an [[electric current]] through it in the process of electrolysis, which is called the [[Hall–Héroult process]] after its American and French discoverers in 1886.

Before Hall and Héroult discovered their process that uses [[cryolite]] and [[electricity]], aluminium was separated from its ore—in small quantities—by heating the ore with metallic [[sodium]] or [[potassium]] in a [[vacuum]]. However, those two metals were themselves produced by electrolysis, and the entire procedure was quite complicated and expensive. The Hall-Heroult process greatly simplified the process of refining aluminium and made it economical to produce aluminium from bauxite in very large quantities.

'''Bavaria''', formally the '''Free State of Bavaria''' ({{lang-de|Freistaat Bayern}}, {{IPA-de|ˈfʁaɪʃtaːt ˈbaɪ.ɐn|pron|Freistaat Bayern.ogg}}) is a [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Germany]], located in the southeast of the country. With an area of {{convert|70548|km2|sqmi|-2}}, it is the largest German state by area, forming almost 20% of the total land area of Germany. Bavaria is Germany's second most populous state (after [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]) with almost 12.5 million inhabitants, more than any of the three sovereign states on its borders. Bavaria's capital is [[Munich]].

One of the oldest states of Europe, it was established as a [[duchy]] in the mid [[1st millennium|first millennium]]. In the 17th century, the Duke of Bavaria became a [[Prince-elector]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] existed from 1806 to 1918, and Bavaria has since been a free state (republic).
Bavaria is a predominantly [[Catholic]] state with a distinct culture. Modern Bavaria also includes parts of the historical regions of [[Franconia]] and [[Swabia]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Bavaria}}
The Bavarians emerged in a region north of the [[Alps]], originally inhabited by the [[Gauls]], which had been part of the Roman provinces of [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]]. The Bavarians spoke [[Old High German]] but, unlike other Germanic groups, did not migrate from elsewhere. Rather, they seem to have coalesced out of other groups left behind by Roman withdrawal late in the 5th century. These peoples may have included the Celtic [[Boii]], some remaining [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], &lt;span lang=&quot;la&quot;&gt;[[Marcomanni]]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span lang=&quot;la&quot;&gt;[[Allemanni]]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span lang=&quot;la&quot;&gt;[[Quadi]]&lt;/span&gt;, [[Thuringians]], [[Goths]], [[Scirians]], [[Rugians]], &lt;span lang=&quot;la&quot;&gt;[[Heruli]]&lt;/span&gt;. The name &quot;Bavarian&quot; (&quot;[[Baiuvarii]]&quot;) means &quot;Men of Baia&quot; which may indicate [[Bohemia]], the homeland of the Celtic Boii and later of the &lt;span lang=&quot;la&quot;&gt;Marcomanni&lt;/span&gt;. They first appear in written sources c. 520. [[Saint Boniface]] completed the people's conversion to Christianity in the early-8th century. Bavaria was, for the most part, unaffected by the [[Protestant Reformation]], and even today, most of it is strongly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].

From about 554 to 788, the house of [[Agilolfing]] ruled the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], ending with [[Tassilo III]] who was deposed by [[Charlemagne]].

Three early dukes are named in [[Franks|Frankish]] sources: [[Garibald I]] may have been appointed to the office by the [[Merovingian]] kings and married the [[Lombardy|Lombard]] princess Walderada when the church forbade her to King Chlothar I in 555. Their daughter, Theodelinde, became Queen of the Lombards in northern Italy and Garibald was forced to flee to her when he fell out with his Frankish overlords. Garibald's successor, Tassilo I, tried unsuccessfully to hold the eastern frontier against the expansion of [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] and [[European Avars|Avars]] around 600. Tassilo's son [[Garibald II of Bavaria|Garibald II]] seems to have achieved a balance of power between 610 and 616.

After Garibald II little is known of the Bavarians until [[Theodo of Bavaria#Ordinals|Duke Theodo I]], whose reign may have begun as early as 680. From 696 onwards he invited churchmen from the west to organize churches and strengthen Christianity in his duchy (it is unclear what Bavarian religious life consisted of before this time). His son, [[Theodbert of Bavaria|Theudebert]], led a decisive Bavarian campaign to intervene in a succession dispute in the [[Lombards|Lombard Kingdom]] in 714, and married his sister Guntrud to the Lombard King Liutprand. At Theodo's death the duchy was divided among his sons, but reunited under his grandson Hucbert.

At Hucbert's death (735) the duchy passed to a distant relative named [[Odilo of Bavaria|Odilo]], from neighbouring Alemannia (modern southwest Germany and northern Switzerland). Odilo issued a law code for Bavaria, completed the process of church organisation in partnership with St. Boniface (739), and tried to intervene in Frankish succession disputes by fighting for the claims of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] [[Grifo]]. He was defeated near [[Augsburg]] in 743 but continued to rule until his death in 748.

===Middle Ages===
{{See|Duchy of Bavaria}}
[[Tassilo III of Bavaria|Tassilo III]] (b. 741 - d. after 794) succeeded his father at the age of eight after an unsuccessful attempt by Grifo to rule Bavaria. He initially ruled under Frankish oversight but began to function independently from 763 onwards. He was particularly noted for founding new monasteries and for expanding eastwards, fighting Slavs in the eastern Alps and along the [[River Danube]] and colonising these lands. After 781, however, his cousin Charlemagne began to pressure Tassilo to submit and finally deposed him in 788. The deposition was not entirely legitimate. Dissenters attempted a coup against Charlemagne at Tassilo's old capital of [[Regensburg]] in 792, led by his own son [[Pepin the Hunchback|Pépin the Hunchback]] (Pronounced ''Pippin''), and the king had to drag Tassilo out of imprisonment to formally renounce his rights and titles at the Assembly of Frankfurt in 794. This is the last appearance of Tassilo in the sources and he probably died a monk. As all of his family were also forced into monasteries, this was the end of the Agilolfing dynasty.

For the next 400 years numerous families held the duchy, rarely for more than three generations. With the revolt of duke [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Quarrelsome]] in 976, Bavaria lost large territories in the south and south east. Among them a mark called &quot;Ostarrichi&quot; which was elevated to a duchy out of own right and given to the Babenberger family. This event marks the birth of Austria. The last, and one of the most important, of these dukes was [[Henry the Lion]] of the house of &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[House of Welf|Welf]]&lt;/span&gt;, founder of Munich, de facto the second most powerful man in the empire as the ruler of two duchies. When in 1180, Henry the Lion was deposed as Duke of [[Saxony]] and Bavaria by his cousin, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] (aka &quot;Barbarossa&quot; for his red beard), Bavaria was awarded as [[fief]] to the &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Wittelsbach]]&lt;/span&gt; family, counts palatinate of Schyren (&quot;Scheyern&quot; in modern German), which ruled from 1180 to 1918. The [[Electoral Palatinate]] by Rhine (&quot;Kurpfalz&quot; in German) was also acquired by the &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[House of Wittelsbach]]&lt;/span&gt; in 1214.

The first of several divisions of the duchy of Bavaria occurred in 1255. With the extinction of the &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]]&lt;/span&gt; in 1268 also [[Swabia]]n territories were acquired by the &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Wittelsbach&lt;/span&gt; dukes. [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Louis the Bavarian]] acquired &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]&lt;/span&gt;, [[German Tyrol|Tirol]], [[Holland]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] for his House but released the [[Upper Palatinate]] for the Palatinate branch of the &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Wittelsbach&lt;/span&gt; in 1329. In 1506 with the [[Landshut War of Succession]] the other parts of Bavaria were reunited and Munich became the sole capital.

===17th and 18th centuries===
In 1623 the Bavarian duke replaced his relative, the [[Electoral Palatinate|Count Palatine of the Rhine]] in the early days of the [[Thirty Years' War]] and acquired the powerful [[prince-elector]]al dignity in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], determining its Emperor thence forward, as well as special legal status under the empire's laws. The country became one of the Jesuit supported counter-reformation centers. During the early and mid-18th century the ambitions of the Bavarian prince electors led to several wars with Austria as well as occupations by Austria (Spanish succession, election of a Wittelsbach emperor instead of a Habsburger). From 1777 onwards and after the old Bavarian branch of the family had died out with elector Max III Joseph, Bavaria and the Electoral Palatinate were governed once again in personal union, now by the Palatinian lines.

===Kingdom of Bavaria===
{{Main|Kingdom of Bavaria}}
When [[Napoleon]] abolished the Holy Roman Empire, Bavaria became a [[Kingdom of Bavaria|kingdom]] in 1806, and its area doubled. &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]]&lt;/span&gt; was temporarily united, &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]]&lt;/span&gt; temporarily reunited with Bavaria but finally ceded to Austria. In return the [[Rhenish Palatinate]] and [[Franconia]] were annexed to Bavaria in 1815. Between 1799 and 1817 the leading minister count [[Maximilian Joseph von Montgelas|Montgelas]] followed a strict policy of modernisation and laid the foundations of administrative structures that survived even the monarchy and are (in their core) valid until today. In 1808 a first and in 1818 a more modern constitution (by the standards of the time) was passed, that established a bicameral Parliament with a House of Lords (&lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Kammer der Reichsräte''&lt;/span&gt;) and a House of Commons (&lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Kammer der Abgeordneten''&lt;/span&gt;). The constitution would last until the collapse of the monarchy at the end of [[World War I]].

===Bavaria as a part of the German Empire===
[[File:riech.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bavarian stamps during the German empire period]]
After the rise of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] to prominence Bavaria managed to preserve its independence by playing off the rivalries of Prussia and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. Allied to Austria, it was defeated in the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]] and did not belong to the [[North German Federation]] of 1867, but the question of German unity was still alive. When France attacked Prussia in 1870, the south German states Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria joined the Prussian forces and ultimately joined the Federation, which was renamed ''Deutsches Reich'' ([[German Empire]]) in 1871. Bavaria continued as a monarchy, and it even had some special rights within the federation (such as an army, railways and a postal service of its own).

In the early-20th century [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], and other notable artists were drawn to Bavaria, notably to the [[Schwabing]] district of Munich, later devastated by [[World War II]].

===20th century===
On November 12, 1918, [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Ludwig III]] signed a document, the [[Anif declaration]], releasing both civil and military officers from their oaths; the newly-formed republican government of Socialist premier [[Kurt Eisner]] interpreted this as an abdication. To date, however, no member of the house of Wittelsbach has ever formally declared renunciation of the throne. On the other hand, none has ever since officially called upon their Bavarian or Stewart claims. Family members are active in cultural and social life, including the head of the house, HRH Duke Franz in Bavaria. They step back from any announcements on public affairs, showing approval or disapproval solely by HRH's presence or absence.

&lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Eisner&lt;/span&gt; was assassinated in February 1919 ultimately leading to a Communist revolt and the short lived [[Bavarian Socialist Republic]] being proclaimed 6 April 1919. After violent suppression by elements of the German Army and notably the [[Freikorps]], the Bavarian Socialist Republic fell in May 1919. Extremist activity further increased, notably the 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]] led by the [[NSDAP|National Socialists]], and Munich and Nuremberg became [[Nazism|Nazi]] strongholds under the [[Third Reich]]. As a manufacturing center, Munich was heavily bombed during World War II and occupied by U.S. troops. The Rhenish Palatinate was detached from Bavaria in 1946 and made part of the new state [[Rhineland-Palatinate]].

Since World War II, Bavaria has been rehabilitated from a poor agrarian province into a prosperous industrial hub. A massive reconstruction effort restored much of Munich's and other places historic cores. The state capital hosted the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] and matches of the Football World Cups of 1974 and 2006 as well as European Track &amp; Field championships. More recently, former state minister-president &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Edmund Stoiber]]&lt;/span&gt; was the CDU/CSU candidate for chancellor in the [[German federal election, 2002|2002 federal election]] which he lost, and native son Cardinal &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Joseph Ratzinger&lt;/span&gt; was elected [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2005.

==Coat of arms==
{{Main|Coat of arms of Bavaria}}
[[File:Bavarian Herald.jpg|right|thumb|Bavarian herald &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Joerg Rugenn&lt;/span&gt; wearing a tabard of the arms around 1510]]
The modern coat of arms of Bavaria was designed by &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Eduard Ege&lt;/span&gt; in 1946, following heraldic traditions.
* The Golden Lion: At the dexter chief, sable, a [[lion (heraldry)|lion]] rampant Or, armed and langued gules. This represents the administrative region of Upper Palatinate.
* The &quot;Franconian Rake&quot;: At the sinister chief, per [[fess]] dancetty, gules and argent. This represents the administrative regions of Upper, Middle and Lower Franconia.
* The Blue Panther: At the dexter base, argent, a panther rampant azure, armed Or and langued gules. This represents the regions of Lower and Upper Bavaria.
* The Three Lions: At the sinister base, Or, three lions passant guardant sable, armed and langued gules. This represents Swabia.
* The White-And-Blue inescutcheon: The [[escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] of white and blue fusils askance was originally the coat of arms of the Counts of Bogen, adopted in 1247 by the &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Wittelsbachs&lt;/span&gt; House. The white-and-blue fusils are indisputably the emblem of Bavaria and these arms today symbolize Bavaria as a whole. Along with the People's Crown, it is officially used as the Minor Coat of Arms.
* The People's Crown: The coat of arms is surmounted by a [[Crown (heraldry)|crown]] with a golden band inset with precious stones and decorated with five ornamental leaves. This crown first appeared in the coat of arms to symbolize sovereignty of [[common people|the people]] after the royal crown was eschewed in 1923.

==Geography==
[[File:Bavarian Alps 2002.jpg|left|thumb|The Bavarian Alps]]
Bavaria, located at {{Coord|48|46|39|N|11|25|51.96|E}} (48.7775, 11.4311), shares international borders with [[Austria]] and the [[Czech Republic]] as well as with [[Switzerland]] (across [[Lake Constance]]). Neighbouring states within Germany are &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Baden-Württemberg]]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Hesse]]&lt;/span&gt;, [[Thuringia]] and [[Saxony]]. Two major rivers flow through the state, the [[Danube]] (&lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Donau''&lt;/span&gt;) and the &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Main (river)|Main]]&lt;/span&gt;. The [[Bavarian Alps]] define the border with Austria, (including the Austrian federal-states of Vorarlberg, Tyrol and Salzburg) and within the range is the highest peak in Germany, the &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Zugspitze]]&lt;/span&gt;. The [[Bavarian Forest]] and the [[Bohemian Forest]] form the vast majority of the frontier with the Czech Republic and Bohemia.

The major cities in Bavaria are Munich (&lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''München''&lt;/span&gt;), [[Nuremberg]] (&lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Nürnberg''&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Augsburg]]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Regensburg]]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Würzburg]]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Ingolstadt]]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Fürth]]&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Erlangen]]&lt;/span&gt;.

==Administrative divisions==
===&lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Regierungsbezirke&lt;/span&gt; (administrative districts)===
[[File:Bavarian Admin Districts.jpg|thumb|Administrative Districts of Bavaria]]

Bavaria is divided into 7 administrative districts called &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Regierungsbezirke''&lt;/span&gt; (singular &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Regierungsbezirk''&lt;/span&gt;).

These administrative regions consist of 71 administrative districts (called &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Landkreise''&lt;/span&gt;, singular &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Landkreis''&lt;/span&gt;) and 25 independent cities (&lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''kreisfreie Städte''&lt;/span&gt;, singular &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''kreisfreie Stadt''&lt;/span&gt;)

===Bezirke===
Bezirke (districts) are the third communal layer in Bavaria; the others are the Landkreise and the Gemeinden or Städte.
In the larger states of Germany (including Bavaria) there are Regierungsbezirke which are only administrative divisions and not self-governing entities as the Bezirke in Bavaria.
The Bezirke in Bavaria are territorially identical with the Regierungsbezirke (e.g. Regierung von Oberbayern), but are a different form of administration (having their own parliaments etc.).

===&lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Gemeinden&lt;/span&gt; (municipalities)===
The 71 administrative districts are on the lowest level divided into 2031 [[municipality|municipalities]] (called &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Gemeinden''&lt;/span&gt;, singular &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Gemeinde''&lt;/span&gt;). Together with the 25 independent cities (which are in effect municipalities independent of &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Landkreis''&lt;/span&gt; administrations), there are a total of 2056 municipalities in Bavaria.

In 44 of the 71 administrative districts, there are a total of 215 [[unincorporated area]]s (as of January 1, 2005, called &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''gemeindefreie Gebiete''&lt;/span&gt;, singular &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''gemeindefreies Gebiet''&lt;/span&gt;), not belonging to any municipality, all uninhabited, mostly forested areas, but also four lakes (&lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Chiemsee]]&lt;/span&gt;-without islands, &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Starnberger See]]&lt;/span&gt;-without island &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Roseninsel&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Ammersee]]&lt;/span&gt;, which are the three largest lakes of Bavaria, and &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Waginger See]]&lt;/span&gt;).

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Bavaria}}

Bavaria has a multi-party system where the biggest parties are the conservative [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU), which has dominated politics since 1945 and won every election since then&lt;!-- until 2008 elections--&gt;, and the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). The German green party, [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] is represented in the parliament as well. Since 2008 Germany's liberal party, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] and the [[Free Voters]] are represented in Bavaria's parliament as well. CSU and FDP agreed in October 2008 to form a coalition, while SPD, Free Voters and the Greens form the opposition.

Bavaria has a [[unicameral]] &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''[[Landtag of Bavaria|Landtag]]''&lt;/span&gt;, or state parliament, elected by universal suffrage. Until December 1999, there was also a &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Senat''&lt;/span&gt;, or [[Senate]], whose members were chosen by social and economic groups in Bavaria, but following a referendum in 1998, this institution was abolished. The head of government is the [[Minister-President]].

In 1995 Bavaria introduced [[direct democracy]] on the local level in a [[referendum]]. This was initiated bottom-up by an association called &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Mehr Demokratie''&lt;/span&gt; (More Democracy). This is a grass-roots organization which campaigns for the right to citizen-initiated referendums. In 1997 the Bavarian Supreme Court aggravated the regulations considerably (e.g. by introducing a turn-out quorum). Nevertheless, Bavaria has the most advanced regulations on local direct democracy in Germany. This has led to a spirited citizens' participation in communal and municipal affairs—835 referenda took place from 1995 through 2005.

In the [[Bavaria state election, 2003|2003 elections]] the CSU won more than two thirds of the seats in &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Landtag]]&lt;/span&gt;—something no party had ever achieved in post-war German history. In the following [[Bavaria state election, 2008|2008 elections]] the CSU lost its absolute majority in the Landtag for the first time in 46 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-tv.de/Koalitionspartner_noetig_Fiasko_fuer_die_CSU/280920085818/1030029.html n-tv:Fiasko für die CSU]&lt;/ref&gt;

This loss is probably attributed to its push for anti-smoking law, the most stringent in Germany, which became one of the most controversial laws ever enacted in Bavaria. As result, CSU changed its stance and weakened the anti-smoking law to allow some more loopholes. However, the citizens held a successful petition drive in November–December 2009 to call for a total smoking ban. CSU dismissed the petition and demands as unnecessary and frivilous, but the referendum proceeded and the voters overwhelmingly voted for the smoking ban.

==German-Bavarian relations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
{{POV-section|date=March 2011}}

The &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''[[Bavaria Party|Bayernpartei]]''&lt;/span&gt; (Bavaria Party) advocates Bavarian independence from Germany. Bavaria was the only state to reject the [[West German constitution]] in 1949, but this did not prevent its implementation. One of Germany's principal political parties, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), is replaced in Bavaria by the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU), but in practice the two parties cooperate fully in the &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Bundestag]]&lt;/span&gt;. Bavaria had [[Bavarian Border Police|its own border police force]], separate from the [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Border Guard]], until [[Austria]]'s [[Enlargement of the European Union#Post-Cold War|EU accession in 1995]].

Furthermore, the people from the three northern districts of Bavaria known as [[Franconia]] ([[Mittelfranken]], [[Oberfranken]] and [[Unterfranken]]), do not all consider themselves as Bavarian. They have their own history and celebrate their own identity, which is distinct from southern Bavaria, and symbolized by the Franconian rake (Fränkischer Rechen). The flag is often seen during local festivals. Some Franconians would also like to see their own Bundesland Franken &quot;Federal State of Franconia&quot;.

==Economy==
Bavaria has long had one of the largest and healthiest economies of any region in Germany, or Europe for that matter.&lt;ref&gt;Its GDP is 143% of the EU average (as of 2005) against a German average of 121.5%, see [http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/extraction/evalight/EVAlight.jsp?A=1&amp;language=en&amp;root=/theme1/reg/reg_e2gdp Eurostat]&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[GDP]] in 2007 exceeded 434 billion Euros (about 600 bn US$).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/Statistik-Portal/de_jb27_jahrtab65.asp Gemeinsames Datenangebot der Statistischen Ämter des Bundes und der Länder]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Bavaria itself one of the largest economies in Europe and only 17 countries in the world have higher GDP.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some large companies headquarted in Bavaria include [[BMW]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Rohde &amp; Schwarz]], [[Audi]], [[Munich Re]], [[Allianz]], [[Infineon]], [[MAN SE|MAN]], [[Wacker Chemie]], [[Puma AG]],and [[Adidas]] AG.

===Company names===
The [[motorcycle]] and [[automobile]] makers [[BMW]] (&lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;''Bayerische Motoren-Werke''&lt;/span&gt;, or Bavarian Motor Works) and &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Audi, Allianz, [[Grundig]]&lt;/span&gt; (consumer electronics), &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Siemens&lt;/span&gt; (electricity, telephones, informatics, medical instruments), &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Continental AG|Continental]]&lt;/span&gt; (Automotive Tire and Electronics), &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Adidas&lt;/span&gt;, [[Puma AG|Puma]], &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;HypoVereinsbank&lt;/span&gt; (UniCredit Group), &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Infineon&lt;/span&gt; and [[Krauss-Maffei|Krauss-Maffei Wegmann]] have (or had) a Bavarian industrial base.

Bavaria has also given its name to the largest [[Colombia]]n brewery ([[Bavaria Brewery|Cervecería Bavaria]]) and a major [[Netherlands|Dutch]] brewery ([[Bavaria Brewery (Netherlands)|Biermerk Bavaria]]).

==Culture==
[[File:Germany bavaria alps-church.jpg|thumb|Bavarian church with Alps in the background]]
[[File:Karwendel-Ahornboden.jpg|right|thumb|Though only a relatively small part belongs to the Alps, the perception of Bavaria as an alpine region endures.]]
Some features of the Bavarian culture and mentality are remarkably distinct from the rest of Germany. Noteworthy differences (especially in rural areas, less significant in the major cities) can be found with respect to:

===Religion===
While 56.4% of the population adhere to the [[Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;chiesa cattolica http://www.dbk.de/imperia/md/content/kirchlichestatistik/bev-kath-l__nd-2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 21% are affiliated with the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;EKD http://www.ekd.de/download/kirchenmitglieder_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Bavaria is predominantly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], but the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria|Evangelical Lutheran Church]] has a strong presence in large parts of [[Franconia]]. Only [[Saarland]] has a higher percentage of Catholics among the German states.

The current pope, Benedict XVI (&lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Joseph Alois Ratzinger&lt;/span&gt;), was born in &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Marktl am Inn]]&lt;/span&gt; in [[Upper Bavaria]] and was Cardinal-[[Archbishop of Munich and Freising]].

Religion remains important to many in the region, as expressed by the typical Bavarian, Austrian and [[Swabian]] greeting: &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;&quot;''[[Grüß Gott]]!''&quot;&lt;/span&gt; (''Greet God!'', originally &quot;es grüße Dich Gott&quot; - &quot;God may bless you&quot;).

===Traditions===
Bavarians commonly emphasize pride in their traditions. Traditional costumes collectively known as &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Tracht]]&lt;/span&gt; are worn on special occasions and include in [[Altbayern]] &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Lederhosen]]&lt;/span&gt; for males and &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Dirndl]]&lt;/span&gt; for females. Centuries-old folk music is performed. The &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Maypole tradition in Bavaria|Maibaum]]&lt;/span&gt;, or Maypole (which in the Middle Ages served as the community's yellow pages, as figurettes on the pole represent the trades of the village), and the bagpipes in the Upper Palatinate region bear witness to the [[Paganism in the Eastern Alps|ancient Celtic and Germanic]] remnants of cultural heritage of the region.

Whether actually in Bavaria, overseas or full of citizens from other nations they continue to cultivate their traditions. They hold festivals and dances to keep their traditions alive. In [[New York]] the German American Cultural Society is a larger umbrella group for others such as the Bavarian organizations, which represent a specific part of Germany. They proudly put forth a German Parade called [[Steuben Parade]] each year. Various affiliated events take place amongst its groups, one of which is the Bavarian Dancers.

===Food and drink===
Bavarians tend to place a great value on [[Bavarian cuisine|food and drink]]. In addition to their renowned dishes, Bavarians also consume many items of food and drink which are unusual elsewhere in Germany; for example {{lang|de|[[Weisswurst]]}} (&quot;white sausage&quot;) or in some instances a great variety of nifty entrails. At folk festivals, beer is traditionally served by the litre (the so-called {{lang|de|[[Maß]]}}). Bavarians are particularly proud of the traditional {{lang|de|[[Reinheitsgebot]]}}, or purity law, initially established by the [[Duke of Bavaria]] for the City of Munich (e.g. the court) in 1487 and the duchy in 1516. According to this law, only three ingredients were allowed in beer: water, [[barley]], and [[hops]]. In 1906 the {{lang|de|Reinheitsgebot}} made its way to all-German law, and remained a law in Germany until the [[European Union|EU]] struck it down recently as incompatible with the European common market. German breweries, however, cling to the principle. Bavarians are also known as some of the world's most beer-loving people with an average annual consumption of 170 litres per person, figures are declining in recent years in favour of soft drinks.

Bavaria is also home to the [[Franconia (wine region)|Franconia wine region]], which is situated along the [[Main River]] in Franconia. The region has produced wine for over 1,000 years and is famous for its use of the [[Bocksbeutel]] wine bottle. The production of wine forms an integral part of the regional culture, and many of its villages and cities hold their own wine festivals (Weinfeste) throughout the year.

===Language and dialects===
[[File:Upper German Languages.PNG|thumb | Upper German, southern counterpart to Central German, both forming the High German Languages]]

Three German dialects are spoken in Bavaria: [[Austro-Bavarian]] in Old Bavaria (South-East and East), [[Swabian German]] (an [[Alemannic German]] dialect) in the Bavarian part of Swabia (South West) and [[East Franconian German]] in Franconia (North).

===Ethnography===
Bavarians consider themselves to be [[egalitarian]] and informal. Their sociability can be experienced at the annual &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[[Oktoberfest]]&lt;/span&gt;, the world's largest beer festival, which welcomes around six million visitors every year, or in the famous beer gardens. In traditional Bavarian [[beer garden]]s, patrons may bring their own food and only buy beer from the brewery that runs the beer garden. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In the United States, particularly among [[German American]]s, Bavarian culture is viewed somewhat nostalgically, and many &quot;Bavarian villages&quot;, most notably [[Frankenmuth, Michigan]] and [[Leavenworth, Washington]], have been founded. Since 1962, the latter has been styled with a Bavarian theme; it is also home to &quot;one of the world's largest collections of [[nutcracker]]s&quot; and an &lt;span lang=&quot;de&quot;&gt;Oktoberfest&lt;/span&gt; celebration it claims is among the most attended in the world outside of Munich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leavenworth.org/ Leavenworth, Washington The Bavarian Village]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brandenburg''' ({{Audio|De-Brandenburg.ogg|&lt;small&gt;listen&lt;/small&gt;}}; [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]]: ''Bramborska''; [[Upper Sorbian language|Upper Sorbian]]: ''Braniborska'') is one of the sixteen [[states of Germany|federal-states]] of [[Germany]]. It lies in the east of the country and is one of the new federal states that were re-created in 1990 upon the reunification of the former [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]]. The capital is [[Potsdam]]. Brandenburg surrounds but does not include the national capital and city-state of [[Berlin]].

Originating in the medieval [[Northern March]], the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] [[Brandenburg-Prussia|grew]] to become the core of the [[Kingdom of Prussia|kingdom]], later [[Free State of Prussia]]. The [[East Brandenburg|eastern third]] of historic Brandenburg (''Ostbrandenburg/[[Neumark]]'') was ceded to [[Poland]] [[Oder-Neisse border|in 1945]].

==History ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Theodor Fontane]] --&gt;
{{History of Brandenburg and Prussia}}
{{Main|Margraviate of Brandenburg}}
In late medieval and early modern times, Brandenburg was one of seven [[prince-elector|electoral states]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and, along with Prussia, formed the original core of the [[German Empire]], the first unified German state. Governed by the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] dynasty from 1415, it contained the future German capital [[Berlin]]. After 1618 the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] and the [[Duchy of Prussia]] were combined to form [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], which was ruled by the same branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. In 1701 the state was elevated as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Franconian [[Nuremberg]] and [[Ansbach]], Swabian [[Burg Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]], the eastern European connections of Berlin, and the status of Brandenburg's ruler as [[prince-elector]] together were instrumental in the rise of that state.

===Early Middle Ages===
{{Main|Northern March}}
Brandenburg is situated in territory known in antiquity as [[Magna Germania]], which reached to the Vistula river. By the 7th century, [[Slavic peoples]] are believed to have settled in the Brandenburg area. The Slavs expanded from the east, possibly driven from their homelands in present-day Ukraine and perhaps Belarus by the invasions of the [[Huns]] and [[European Avars|Avars]]. They relied heavily on river transport. The two principal Slavic groups in the present-day area of Brandenburg were the [[Hevelli]] in the west and the [[Sprevane]] in the east.

Beginning in the early 10th century, [[Henry the Fowler]] and his successors conquered territory up to the [[Oder River]]. Slavic settlements such as Brenna&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barford|first=Paul M.|title=The Early Slavs: Culture and Society in Early Medieval Eastern Europe|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|year=2001|pages=421|isbn=0801439779}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Brandenburg an der Havel]]), Budusin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Institut für Sorbische Volksforschung in Bautzen|first=|title=Lětopis Instituta za serbski ludospyt|publisher=Domowina|location=Bautzen|year=1962|pages=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Bautzen]]), and Chośebuz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Room|first=Adrian|title=Placenames of the World|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson|year=2006|pages=433|isbn=0786422483}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Cottbus]]) came under [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] control through the installation of margraves. Their main function was to defend and protect the eastern [[marches]]. In 948 Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] established margraves to exert imperial control over the pagan Slavs west of the Oder River. Otto founded the Bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] and [[Bishopric of Havelberg|Havelberg]]. The [[Northern March]] was founded as a northeastern border territory of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. However, a great uprising of [[Wends]] drove imperial forces from the territory of present-day Brandenburg in 983. The region returned to the control of Slavic leaders.

===12th century===
[[Image:Belzig Burg 2.JPG|thumb|Eisenhard Castle in [[Belzig]]]]
During the 12th century the [[Ottonian]] German kings and emperors re-established control over the mixed Slav-inhabited lands of present-day Brandenburg, although some Slavs like the [[Sorbs]] in [[Lusatia]] adapted to [[Germanization]] while retaining their distinctiveness. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] brought bishoprics which, with their walled towns, afforded protection from attacks for the townspeople. With the monks and bishops, the history of the town of [[Brandenburg (town)|Brandenburg an der Havel]], which was the first center of the state of Brandenburg, began. In 1134, in the wake of a German [[Northern Crusade|crusade]] against the [[Wends]], the German magnate [[Albert the Bear]] was granted the [[Northern March]] by the Emperor [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar III]]. He formally inherited the town of Brandenburg and the lands of the Hevelli from their last Wendish ruler, [[Pribislav of Brandenburg|Pribislav]], in 1150. After crushing a force of Sprevane who occupied the town of Brandenburg in the 1150s, Albert proclaimed himself ruler of the new [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]]. Albert, and his descendants the [[House of Ascania|Ascanians]], then made considerable progress in conquering, colonizing, Christianizing, and cultivating lands as far east as the Oder. Within this region, Slavic and German residents intermarried. During the 13th century the Ascanians began acquiring territory east of the Oder, later known as the [[Neumark]] (see also [[Altmark]]).

===Late Middle Ages===
{{Main|Margraviate of Brandenburg}}
In 1320 the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end, and from 1323 up until 1415 Brandenburg was under the control of the [[Wittelsbach]]s of [[Bavaria]], followed by the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] dynasty. Under the Luxembourgs, the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]] gained the status of a [[prince-elector]] of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1415, the Electorate of Brandenburg was granted by Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] to the [[House of Hohenzollern]], which would rule until the end of [[World War I]]. The Hohenzollerns established their capital in Berlin, by then the economic center of Brandenburg.

===16th and 17th centuries===
{{Main|Brandenburg-Prussia}}
Brandenburg converted to [[Protestantism]] in 1539 in the wake of the [[Protestant Reformation]], and generally did quite well in the 16th century, with the expansion of trade along the Elbe, Havel, and Spree Rivers. The Hohenzollerns expanded their territory by acquiring the [[Duchy of Prussia]] in 1618, the [[Duchy of Cleves]] (1614) in the [[Rhineland]], and territories in [[Westphalia]]. The result was a sprawling, disconnected country known as [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] that was in poor shape to defend itself during the [[Thirty Years' War]].

Beginning near the end of that devastating conflict, however, Brandenburg enjoyed a string of talented rulers who expanded their territory and power in Europe. The first of these was [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], the so-called &quot;Great Elector&quot;, who worked tirelessly to rebuild and consolidate the nation. He moved the royal residence to [[Potsdam]].

===Kingdom of Prussia and united Germany===
{{Main|Kingdom of Prussia|Province of Brandenburg}}
[[Image:Potsdam Sanssouci Palace.jpg|thumb|[[Sanssouci Palace]], the former summer palace of [[Frederick the Great]], today a [[World Heritage site]]]]

When Frederick William died in 1688, he was followed by his son [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick]], third of that name in Brandenburg. As the lands that had been acquired in Prussia were outside the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick assumed (as Frederick I) the title of &quot;[[King in Prussia]]&quot; (1701). Although his self-promotion from margrave to king relied on his title to the Duchy of Prussia, Brandenburg was still the most important portion of the kingdom. However, this combined state is known as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

Brandenburg remained the core of the Kingdom of Prussia, and it was the site of the kingdom's capitals, Berlin and Potsdam. When Prussia was subdivided into provinces in 1815, the territory of the Margraviate of Brandenburg became the [[Province of Brandenburg]]. In 1881, the City of [[Berlin]] was separated from the Province of Brandenburg. However, industrial towns ringing Berlin lay within Brandenburg, and the growth of the region's industrial economy brought an increase in the population of the province. The Province of Brandenburg had an area of {{convert|39039|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and a population of 2.6 million (1925). After [[World War II]], the [[Neumark (region)|Neumark]], the part of Brandenburg east of the [[Oder-Neisse Line]], was transferred to [[Poland]]; and its native German population expelled. The remainder of the province became a state in East Germany when Prussia was dissolved in 1947. The State of Brandenburg was completely dissolved in 1952 by the Socialist government of [[East Germany]].

===East Germany and reunified Germany===
{{Main|German reunification}}
In 1952, the East German government divided Brandenburg among several ''Bezirke'' or districts. (See [[Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic]]). Most of Brandenburg lay within the Potsdam, Frankfurt (Oder), or Cottbus districts, but parts of the former province passed to the Schwerin, Neubrandenburg and Magdeburg districts (town [[Havelberg]]). East Germany relied heavily on [[lignite]] (the lowest grade of coal) as an energy source, and lignite strip mines marred areas of southeastern Brandenburg. The industrial towns surrounding Berlin were important to the East German economy, while rural Brandenburg remained mainly agricultural.

The present State of Brandenburg was re-established on 14 October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verfassungen.de/de/ddr/ddr90-laeeinf.htm Ländereinführungsgesetz (1990)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The newly elected Landtag of Brandenburg first met on 26 October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandenburg-geburtstag.de/aktuell/historischer-kalender/]&lt;/ref&gt; As in other former parts of East Germany, the lack of modern infrastructure and exposure to West Germany's competitive market economy brought widespread joblessness and economic difficulty. In the recent years, however, Brandenburg's infrastructure has been modernized and joblessness has slowly declined.

In 1995, the governments of Berlin and Brandenburg proposed to merge the states in order to form a new state with the name of &quot;Berlin-Brandenburg&quot;. The merger was rejected in a [[plebiscite]] in 1996 - while West Berliners voted for a merger, East Berliners and Brandenburgers voted against it.

==Geography==
{{See also|Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|List of places in Brandenburg}}
Brandenburg is bordered by [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] in the north, [[Poland]] in the east, the [[Free State of Saxony|Freistaat Sachsen]] in the south, [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in the west, and [[Lower Saxony]] in the northwest.

The [[Oder River]] forms a part of the eastern border, the [[Elbe|Elbe River]] a portion of the western border. The main rivers in the state itself are the [[Spree]] and the [[Havel]]. In the southeast, there is a wetlands region called the [[Spreewald]]; it is the northernmost part of [[Lusatia]], where the [[Sorbs]], a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] people, still live. These areas are bilingual, i.e., [[German language|German]] and [[Sorbian language|Sorbian]] are both used.

===Protected areas===
Brandenburg is known for its well-preserved natural environment and its ambitious natural protection policies which began in the 1990s. 15 large protected areas were designated following [[German reunification|Germany's reunification]]. Each of them is provided with state-financed administration and a park ranger staff, who guide visitors and work to ensure nature conservation. Most protected areas have visitor centers.

{{PoliticsGermany}}
The '''Bundestag''' (Federal [[diet (assembly)|Diet]]; {{IPA-de|ˈbʊndəstaːk|pron}}) is a federal legislative body in [[Germany]]. In practice Germany is governed by a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]], of which the Bundestag has the role of [[lower house]]. The Bundestag is established by the German [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of 1949, as the successor to the earlier [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]. [[Norbert Lammert]] is the current [[President of the Bundestag]].

==History==
With the dissolution of the [[German Confederation]] in 1866 and the founding of the [[German Empire]] ([[Deutsches Reich]]) in 1871, the Reichstag was established as the German parliament in Berlin. Two decades later, the current parliament building was erected. The Reichstag delegates were elected by direct and equal male suffrage (and not the three-class electoral system prevailing in Prussia until 1918). The Reichstag did not participate in the appointment of the Chancellor until the parliamentary reforms of October 1918. After the Revolution of November 1918 and the establishment of the Weimar Constitution, women were given the right to vote for (and serve in) the Reichstag, and the parliament could use the no-confidence vote to force the chancellor or any cabinet member to resign. In March 1933, one month after the [[Reichstag fire]], parliament ceded its powers to the Federal Government of Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]] by passing the [[Enabling act of 1933]]. Afterward it met only rarely to unanimously rubber-stamp the decisions of the government. It last convened on 26 April 1942.

With the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|new constitution of 1949]], the Bundestag was established as the new (West) German parliament.  Because [[West Berlin]] was not officially under the jurisdiction of the Constitution and because of the [[Cold War]], the Bundestag met in [[Bonn]] in several different buildings, including (provisionally) a former water works facility. In addition, citizens of West Berlin were unable to vote in elections to the Bundestag, and were instead represented by 20 non-voting delegates, indirectly elected by the city's House of Representatives.

The [[Bundeshaus (Bonn)|Bundeshaus in Bonn]] is the former Parliament Building of Germany. The sessions of the German Bundestag were held there from 1949 until its move to Berlin in 1999. Today it houses the [[International Congress Centre Bundeshaus Bonn]] and in the north areas the branch office of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] (Upper House). The southern areas became part of German offices for the [[United Nations]] in 2008.

The former [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] building housed a history exhibition (Fragen an die deutsche Geschichte) and served occasionally as a conference center. The Reichstag building was also occasionally used as a venue for sittings of the Bundestag and its committees and the [[Bundesversammlung]], the body which elects the German Federal President. However the Soviets harshly protested against the use of the Reichstag building by institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and tried to disturb the sittings by flying supersonic jets close to the building.

Since 1999, the German parliament has again assembled in [[Berlin]] in its original [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]], which dates from the 1890s and underwent a significant renovation under the lead of British architect [[Sir Norman Foster]]. Parliamentary committees and subcommittees, public hearings and faction meetings take place in three auxiliary buildings, which surround the Reichstag building: the [[Jakob-Kaiser-Haus]], [[Paul-Löbe-Haus]] and [[Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus]].

In 2005, a small aircraft crashed close to the German parliament. It was then decided to ban private air traffic over Central Berlin.

==Tasks==
Together with the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]], the Bundestag is the [[legislative branch]] of the [[Politics of Germany|German political system]].

Although most legislation is initiated by the executive branch, the Bundestag considers the legislative function its most important responsibility, concentrating much of its energy on assessing and amending the government's legislative program. The committees (see below) play a prominent role in this process. Plenary sessions provide a forum for members to engage in public debate on legislative issues before them, but they tend to be well attended only when significant legislation is being considered.

The Bundestag members are the only federal officials directly elected by the public; the Bundestag in turn elects the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] and, in addition, exercises oversight of the executive branch on issues of both substantive policy and routine administration. This check on executive power can be employed through binding legislation, public debates on government policy, investigations, and direct questioning of the chancellor or cabinet officials. For example, the Bundestag can conduct a question hour ''(Fragestunde),'' in which a government representative responds to a previously submitted written question from a member. Members can ask related questions during the question hour. The questions can concern anything from a major policy issue to a specific constituent's problem. Use of the question hour has increased markedly over the past forty years, with more than 20,000 questions being posed during the 1987-90 term. Understandably, the opposition parties are active in exercising the parliamentary right to scrutinize government actions.

One striking difference when comparing the Bundestag with the [[British Parliament]] is the lack of time spent on serving constituents in Germany. This is in part due to Germany's electoral system. A practical constraint on the expansion of constituent service is the limited personal staff of Bundestag deputies. Despite these constraints especially those deputies that are elected directly normally try to keep close contact with their constituents and to help them with their problems, particularly when they are related to federal policies or agencies.

Constituent service does also take place in the form of the Petition Committee. In 2004, the Petition Committee received over 18,000 complaints from citizens and was able to negotiate a mutually satisfactory solution to more than half of them. In 2005, as a pilot of the potential of [[internet petition]]s, a version of [[e-Petitioner]] was produced for the Bundestag. This was a collaborative project involving The [[Scottish Parliament]], [[International Teledemocracy Centre]] and the Bundestag ‘Online Services Department’.  The system was formally launched on 1 September 2005, and in 2008 the Bundestag moved to a new system based on its evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tab.fzk.de/de/brief/brief32.pdf |title=''Öffentliche Petitionen beim deutschen Bundestag - erste Ergebnisse der Evaluation des Modellversuchs'' = An Evaluation Study of Public Petitions at the German Parliament'' |accessdate=2009-06-16 |last=Trenel|first=M.|work=TAB Brief Nr 32 |publisher=Deutscher Bundestag |year=2007 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election==
[[File:Vladimir Putin in Germany 25-27 September 2001-14.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vladimir Putin]] addresses the Bundestag]]
Members serve four-year terms; elections are held every four years, or earlier in the relatively rare case that the Bundestag is being dissolved prematurely by the [[President of Germany|president]]. The Bundestag can be dissolved by the president on the recommendation of the chancellor if the latter has lost a vote of confidence in the Bundestag. This has happened three times as of 2005: 1972 under Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], 1982 under Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] and 2005 under Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]].

All candidates must be at least eighteen years old; there are no term limits. The election uses the [[Mixed member proportional representation|MMP electoral system]], a hybrid of the [[first-past-the-post election system]] and [[party-list proportional representation]]. In addition, the Bundestag has a minimum threshold of either 5% of the national party vote or three (directly elected) constituency representatives for a [[political party|party]] to gain additional representation through the system of proportional representation.

Thus, small minority parties cannot easily enter the Bundestag and prevent the formation of stable majority governments as they could under the Weimar constitution. Since 1961, only two new parties ([[Bündnis 90/Die Grünen]] and [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS]]/[[Die Linke]]) have entered the Bundestag.

The most recent election, the [[German federal election, 2009]], was held on September 27, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawley&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,601451,00.html|title=Political Landscape in Flux ahead of 2009 Votes|last=Hawley|first=Charles|date=15 January 2009|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=2009-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution of seats in the Bundestag===
[[File:Bundestagswahl 05 stimmzett.jpg|thumb|right|Bundestag ballot: constituency vote on left, party list (showing top five list candidates) vote on right]]
Half of the Members of the Bundestag are elected directly from 299 constituencies ([[first-past-the-post system]]), the other half are elected from the parties’ Land lists in such a way as to achieve [[proportional representation]] for the total Bundestag (if possible).

Accordingly, each voter has two votes in the elections to the Bundestag. The first vote, allowing voters to elect their local representatives to the Bundestag, decides which candidates are sent to Parliament from the constituencies.
The second vote is cast for a party list; it determines the relative strengths of the parties represented in the Bundestag.

At least 598 Members of the Bundestag are elected in this way. In addition to this, there are certain circumstances  in which some candidates win what are known as [[overhang seat]]s when the seats are being distributed.

The 598 seats are distributed among the parties that have gained more than 5% of the second votes or at least 3 direct mandates. Each of these parties is allocated seats in the Bundestag in proportion to the number of votes it has received ([[d'Hondt method]] until 1987, [[largest remainder method]] until the 2005 election, now [[Sainte-Laguë method]]).

When the total number of mandates gained by a party has been determined, they are distributed between the Land lists. The distribution of the seats of that party to the 16 Lands is proportional to that party's second vote results in the Lands.
The first of the mandates allocated to each Land go to the candidates who have won direct mandates in that Land. 
The rest are assigned in order to the candidates on the Land list put forward before the election.

[[Overhang seat]]:
If a party has gained more direct mandates in a Land than it is entitled to according to the results of the second vote, it does not forfeit these mandates because all directly elected candidates are guaranteed a seat in the Bundestag.

==Organization==
[[File:M E Lueders Haus 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus'', one of the official buildings of the complex]]

===Parliamentary groups===

The most important organizational structures within the Bundestag are [[fraction (politics)|parliamentary groups]] (''Fraktionen''; sing. ''Fraktion''), which are formed by political parties represented in the chamber which have gained more than 5% of the total votes; [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] have always formed a single united ''Fraktion''. The size of a party's ''Fraktion'' determines the extent of its representation on legislative committees, the time slots allotted for speaking, the number of committee chairs it can hold, and its representation in executive bodies of the Bundestag. The ''Fraktionen,'' not the members, receive the bulk of government funding for legislative and administrative activities.

The leadership of each ''Fraktion'' consists of a parliamentary party leader, several deputy leaders, and an executive committee. The leadership's major responsibilities are to represent the ''Fraktion,'' enforce party discipline, and orchestrate the party's parliamentary activities. The members of each ''Fraktion'' are distributed among [[working group]]s focused on specific policy-related topics such as social policy, economics, and foreign policy. The ''Fraktion'' meets every Tuesday afternoon in the weeks in which the Bundestag is in session to consider legislation before the Bundestag and formulate the party's position on it.

Parties which do not fulfill the criterion for being a ''Fraktion'' but have at least three seats by direct elections (i.e. which have at least three MPs representing a certain electoral district) in the Bundestag can be granted the status of a ''group'' of the Bundestag. This applied to the [[Left Party (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS) from 1990-1998. This status entails some privileges which are in general less than those of a ''Fraktion''. In the current Bundestag, there are no such groups (the PDS had only two MPs in parliament until 2005 and could thus not even considered a group anymore; the party has now returned to the Bundestag with full ''Fraktion'' status).

===Executive bodies===

The Bundestag's executive bodies include the [[Council of Elders of the Bundestag (Germany)|Council of Elders]] and the [[Presidium of the Bundestag|Presidium]]. The council consists of the Bundestag leadership, together with the most senior representatives of each ''fraktion'', with the number of these representatives tied to the strength of the party in the chamber. The council is the coordination hub, determining the daily legislative agenda and assigning committee chairpersons based on party representation. The council also serves as an important forum for interparty negotiations on specific legislation and procedural issues. The Presidium is responsible for the routine administration of the Bundestag, including its clerical and research activities. It consists of the chamber's president (usually elected from the largest ''fraktion'') and vice presidents (one from each ''fraktion'').

===Committees===

Most of the legislative work in the Bundestag is the product of standing committees, which exist largely unchanged throughout one legislative period.  The number of committees approximates the number of federal ministries, and the titles of each are roughly similar (e.g., defense, agriculture, and labor). Between 1987 and 1990, the term of the eleventh Bundestag, there were twenty-one standing committees. The distribution of committee chairs and the membership of each committee reflect the relative strength of the various parties in the chamber. In the eleventh Bundestag, the [[Christian-Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]] chaired eleven committees, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] eight, the [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] one, and the environmentalist party, the [[German Green Party|Greens]] (Die Grünen), one. Members of the opposition party can chair a significant number of standing committees. These committees have either a small staff or no staff at all.

==Principle of discontinuation==
As is the case with some other parliaments, the Bundestag is subject to the ''principle of discontinuation'', meaning that a newly elected Bundestag is legally regarded to be a body and entity completely different from the previous Bundestag. This leads to the result, that any motion, application or action submitted to the previous Bundestag, e.g. a bill referred to the Bundestag by the Federal Government, is regarded as completed by non-decision (German terminology: “''Die Sache fällt der Diskontinuität anheim''”). Thus any bill that has not been decided upon by the beginning of the new electoral period must to be brought up by the government again, if it aims to uphold the motion, this procedure in effect delaying the passage of the bill. Furthermore, any newly elected Bundestag will have to freshly decide on the rules of procedure (''Geschäftsordnung''), which is done by a formal decision of taking over such rules from the preceding ''Bundestag'' by reference.

Any Bundestag is considered dissolved only once a newly elected Bundestag has actually gathered in order to constitute itself (Article&amp;nbsp;39 sec.&amp;nbsp;1 sentence&amp;nbsp;2 of the Basic Law), which has to happen within 30 days of its election (Article&amp;nbsp;39 sec.&amp;nbsp;2 of the Basic Law). Thus, it may happen (and has happened) that the old Bundestag gathers and makes decisions even after the election of a new Bundestag that has not gathered in order to constitute itself. For example, elections to the 16th Bundestag took place on 18 September 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/wahlen/pm-wahl-16-dbt/pd040211.htm |title=Press Release: ''Verkürzte Fristen zur vorgezogenen Neuwahl des Deutschen Bundestages'' |accessdate=2008-10-20 |work=www.bundeswahlleiter.de |publisher=Bundeswahlleiter = ''Federal Director for Elections'' |date= 2005-07-25}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the 15th Bundestag still convened after election day to make some decisions on German military engagement abroad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btp/15/15187.pdf |title=''Stenographischer Bericht der 187.

[[File:BMW-HQ.jpg|thumb||right|[[BMW Headquarters]] in [[Munich]], Germany]]
{{Main|History of BMW}}

BMW entered existence as a business entity following a restructuring of the [[Rapp Motorenwerke]] aircraft engine manufacturing firm in 1917. After the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft engine production by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Armistice Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pilotenschule.ch/geschichte.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070528021613/http://www.pilotenschule.ch/geschichte.htm |archivedate=2007-05-28 |title= Fliegerschule St.Gallen&amp;nbsp;– history|accessdate=2008-08-24 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company consequently shifted to [[motorcycle]] production in 1923 once the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8XEV3HRlBZ4C|title=BMW Motorcycles|author=Darwin Holmstrom, Brian J.

The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel is portrayed by BMW as the movement of an aircraft propeller, to signify the white blades cutting through the blue sky &amp;mdash; an interpretation that BMW adopted for convenience in 1929, twelve years after the roundel was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmwrocketscience.com/upload/roundel-myth.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Origin of the BMW Logo: Fact and Fiction |date= |accessdate= 1 August 2009|author=Dr. Florian Triebel | work= Mobile Tradition live / Issue 01.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Uniquely BMW|volume= 1|year=2006|publisher=BMW North America|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emblem evolved from the circular  [[Rapp Motorenwerke]] company logo, from which the BMW company grew, combined with the blue and white colours of the flag of [[Bavaria]], reversed to produce the BMW roundel. However, the origin of the logo being based on the movement of a propeller is in dispute, according to an article posted in 2010 by the New York Times, quoting &quot;At the BMW Museum in Munich, Anne Schmidt-Possiwal, explained that the blue-and-white company logo did not represent a spinning propeller, but was meant to show the colours of the Free State of Bavaria.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams |first=Stephen |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/bmw-roundel-not-born-from-planes/#mor%20e-37637 |title=Origins of BMW roundel |publisher=Wheels.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=April 2011}}

BMW's first significant aircraft engine was the BMW IIIa inline-six liquid-cooled engine of 1918, much preferred for its high-altitude performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19710908000 |title=BMW Model IIIA - Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum |publisher=Nasm.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the [[Luftwaffe]]. Among its successful [[World War II]] engine designs were the [[BMW 132]] and [[BMW 801]] air-cooled [[radial engines]], and the pioneering [[BMW 003]] [[axial compressor|axial-flow]] [[turbojet]], which powered the tiny, 1944-1945-era jet-powered &quot;emergency fighter&quot;, the [[Heinkel He 162]] ''Spatz.''  The BMW 003 jet engine was tested in the A-1b version of the world's first jet fighter, the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]], but BMW engines failed on takeoff, a major setback for the jet fighter program until successful testing with Junkers engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://books.google.com/?id=dSLBdP22fq0C&amp;pg=PA31 |title=The Jet Race and the Second World War |first=Sterling Michael |last=Pavelec |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=007 |isbn=0275993558, 9780275993559}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Radinger |first=Will |first2= Walter |last2=Schick. |title=Me262 (in German) |location=Berlin |publisher=Avantic Verlag GmbH |year=1996 |isbn=3-925505-21-0 |page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the year 1959, the automotive division of BMW was in financial difficulties and a shareholders meeting was held to decide whether to go into liquidation or find a way of carrying on. It was decided to carry on and to try to cash in on the current economy car boom enjoyed so successfully by some of Germany's ex-aircraft manufacturers such as [[Messerschmitt]] and [[Heinkel]]. The rights to manufacture the Italian [[Isetta|Iso Isetta]] were bought; the tiny cars themselves were to be powered by a modified form of BMW's own motorcycle engine. This was moderately successful and helped the company get back on its feet. The controlling majority shareholder of the BMW [[Stock corporation|Aktiengesellschaft]] since 1959 is the Quandt family, which owns about 46% of the stock. The rest is in [[public float]].

BMW acquired the [[Hans Glas]] company based in [[Dingolfing]], Germany, in 1966. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas' development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications.&lt;ref&gt;Toronto Star July 3 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Glas vehicles were briefly badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed.

In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in [[California]] based [[industrial design]] studio [[DesignworksUSA]], which they fully acquired in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the British [[Rover Group]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KdbY5QkQ64cC|title=Corporate Cultures And Global Brands|author=Albrecht Rothacher|year=2004|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9812388567|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which at the time consisted of the [[Rover (car)|Rover]], [[Land Rover]] and [[MG (car)|MG]] brands as well as the rights to defunct brands including [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Morris Motor Company|Morris]]), and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was making huge losses and BMW decided to sell the combine. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form [[MG Rover]], while Land Rover was taken over by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the new [[BMW Mini|Mini]], which was launched in 2001.

Chief designer [[Chris Bangle]] announced his departure from BMW in February 2009, after serving on the design team for nearly seventeen years. He was replaced by [[Adrian van Hooydonk]], Bangle's former right hand man. Bangle was known for his radical designs such as the 2002 7-Series and the 2002 Z4. In July 2007, the production rights for [[Husqvarna Motorcycles]] was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros. [[BMW Motorrad]] plans to continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise. All development, sales and production activities, as well as the current workforce, have remained in place at its present location at Varese.

==Production==
In 2006, the BMW group (including Mini and Rolls-Royce) produced 1,366,838 four-wheeled vehicles, which were manufactured in five countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oica.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/bmw.pdf |title=World Motor Vehicle Production, OICA correspondents survey 2006 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, it manufactured 1,481,253 four-wheeled vehicles and 112,271 motorcycles (under both the BMW and Husqvarna brands).&lt;ref name=&quot;AR2010&quot; /&gt;

The BMW X3 (E83) was made by Magna Steyr, a subsidiary of Magna of Canada, in Graz, Austria under license from BMW until 2010. Over 45.973 were produced in 2009.
Starting October 2010 the new BMW X3 (F25) is produced in BMW's plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, U.S.A. From September 2010, the plant is producing MINI Countryman.

It is reported that about 56 per cent BMW brand vehicles produced are powered by petrol engines and the remaining 44 per cent are powered by diesel engines. Of those petrol vehicles, about 27 per cent are four cylinder models and about nine per cent are eight-cylinder models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/blogs/autocarconfidential/archive/2011/02/18/the-future-of-bmw-s-engines.aspx |title=The future of BMW's engines |date=2011-02-11 |author=Hilton Holloway |publisher=Autocar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:R32-pn.jpg|thumb|right|The [[BMW R32|R32]] [[motorcycle]], the first BMW [[motor vehicle|motor vehicle.]]]]
BMW began building motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after [[World War I]]. Its motorcycle brand is now known as [[BMW Motorrad]]. Their first successful motorcycle, after the failed Helios and Flink, was the &quot;[[BMW R32|R32]]&quot; in 1923. This had a &quot;[[Flat-twin engine|boxer]]&quot; twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMWs are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].
[[File:R35-roundel.jpg|thumb|left|BMW roundel in 1939]]
[[File:K1200gt600.jpg|thumb|left|[[BMW K1200GT]]]]
[[File:R67-3-front-left.jpg|thumb|right|BMW [[BMW R51/3|1955 R67/3]] was the last of the &quot;plunger&quot; models]]During the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a [[sidecar]] attached. Featuring a unique design copied from the [[Zündapp]] KS750, its sidecar wheel was also motor-driven.  Combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to the [[Willys MB|Jeep]].

In 1982, came the  [[History of BMW motorcycles#K series|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.

In the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&amp;nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{Convert|98|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.

In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It features an engine producing {{Convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.

BMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles pave the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.

BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Motorcycle fork#Earles|Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).
Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.

In July 2007, the Italian-made [[Husqvarna Motorcycles]] was purchased by [[BMW Motorrad|BMW]] for a reported €93 million. BMW Motorrad plans to continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise.

===New Class===
{{Main|BMW New Class}}

The ''New Class'' (German: ''Neue Klasse'') was a line of compact [[sedan (car)|sedans]] and coupes starting with the 1962 1500 and continuing through the last 2002s in 1977. Powered by BMW's celebrated [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] [[BMW M10|M10]] engine, the New Class models featured a fully [[independent suspension]], [[MacPherson strut]]s in front, and front disc brakes. Initially a family of four-door sedans and two-door coupes, the New Class line was broadened to two-door sports sedans with the addition of the ''02 Series'' 1600 and 2002 in 1966.

Sharing little in common with the rest of the line beyond power train, the sporty siblings caught auto enthusiasts' attention and established BMW as an international brand. Precursors to the famed BMW [[3 Series]], the two-doors' success cemented the firm's future as an upper tier performance car maker. New Class four-doors with numbers ending in &quot;0&quot; were replaced by the larger [[BMW 5 Series]] in 1972. The upscale 2000C and 2000CS coupes were replaced by the [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] [[BMW E9]], introduced in 1969 with the 2800CS. The 1600 two-door was discontinued in 1975, the 2002 replaced by the 320i in 1975.

BMW's [[full-size car|full-size]] flagship executive [[sedan (car)|sedan]] is the [[BMW 7 Series|7 Series]]. Typically, BMW introduces many of their innovations first in the 7 Series, such as the somewhat controversial [[iDrive]] system. The 7 Series Hydrogen, featuring one of the world's first [[hydrogen]] fueled internal combustion engines, is fueled by liquid hydrogen and emits only clean water vapor. The latest generation (F01) debuted in 2009.

[[File:BMW M3 E92 coupe front.jpg|thumb|BMW M3 Coupé (E92)]]
Based on the 3 Series, the [[BMW M3|M3]] defined an entirely new market for BMW: a race-ready production vehicle. Since its debut, the M3 is heralded in enthusiast circles, in large part due to its unique geometry and award winning engines. The newest V8-powered platform became available the Autumn of 2007 in Europe, and second quarter of 2008 for the U.S. in coupe (E92), and later the cabriolet (E93), and sedan (E90) variants. Based on the 5 Series, the [[BMW M5|M5]] is the M division's V10-powered version of the E60 5 Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/mseries/m5/2007/_shared/pdf/m5_sedan_touring_datasheet.pdf |title=Equipment and Technical data |accessdate=2008-05-17 |format=PDF |work=BMW AG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BMW M6|M6]] is the M division's version of the 6 Series, and shares its drivetrain with the M5.

===Sport sponsorship beyond motor sport===
BMW does more than just motor sport sponsorship. It sponsors international polo matches played at [[Shongweni]] in [[Durban]] and [[Illovo, Gauteng|Illovo]] in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} BMW and the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) made six year sponsorship deal official in July 2010. Those at BMW and the USOC officials see nothing contradictory about a German company sponsoring Olympians in the USA in this [[global economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/more/07/26/usoc.ap/index.html | work=CNN | title=BMW, USOC make 6-year sponsorship deal official | date=2010-07-26}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental record==
The company is a charter member of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) National Environmental Achievement Track, which recognises companies for their environmental stewardship and performance. It is also a member of the South Carolina Environmental Excellence Program and is on the [[Dow Jones]] Sustainability Group Index, which rates environmentally friendly companies.&lt;ref&gt;Grahl, C:  “Green finishing”, page 35(4).  Industrial Paint &amp; Powder, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
BMW has taken measures to reduce the impact the company has on the environment. It is trying to design less-polluting cars by making existing models more efficient, as well as developing environmentally friendly fuels for future vehicles. Possibilities include: electric power, hybrid power (combustion, engines and electric motors) hydrogen engines.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, J and Walker, M: “BMW A Sustainable Future? ”, page 11. Wild World 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

BMW offers 49 models with EU5/6 emissions norm and nearly 20 models with CO2 output less than 140 g/km, which puts it on the lowest tax group and therefore could provide the future owner with eco-bonus offered from some European countries.

However, there have been some criticisms directed at BMW, and in particular, accusations of [[greenwash]] in reference to their BMW Hydrogen 7. Some critics claim that the emissions produced during [[hydrogen fuel]] production outweigh the reduction of tailpipe emissions, and that the Hydrogen 7 is a distraction from more immediate, practical solutions for car pollution.&lt;ref&gt;

==BMW nomenclature==
BMW vehicles follow a certain nomenclature; usually a 3 digit number is followed by 1 or 2 letters. The first number represents the series number. The next two numbers traditionally represent the [[engine displacement]] in cubic centimeters divided by 100.&lt;ref&gt;W.P. BMW Group Canada Inc. http://www.bmw.ca&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent cars use those two numbers as a performance index, as e.g. the 116i, 118i and 120i (all 2,0L gas-powered), just like the 325d and 330d (both 3,0L diesel) share the same motor block while adjusting engine power through setup and turbocharging. A [[History of BMW motorcycles#Model designation|similar nomenclature]] is used by [[BMW Motorrad]] for their motorcycles.

The system of letters can be used in combination, and is as follows:
* A = [[automatic transmission]]
* C = [[coupé]], last used on the [[BMW E46]] and the [[BMW E63]] (dropped after 2005 model year)
* c = [[convertible|cabriolet]]
* d = [[diesel engine|diesel]]&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
* e = [[BMW M20|eta]] (efficient economy, from the [[eta|Greek letter 'η']])
* g = [[compressed natural gas|compressed natural gas/CNG]]
* h = [[hydrogen]]
* i = [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]]
* L = [[wheelbase|long wheelbase]]
* s = sport, also means &quot;2 dr&quot; on E36 model&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt;
* sDrive = [[rear wheel drive]]
* T = [[station wagon|touring (wagon/estate)]]
* Ti = [[hatchback]] for the [[BMW Compact|BMW 3 Series hatchback]]
* x / xDrive = [[BMW xDrive]] [[all wheel drive]]

&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; historic nomenclature indicating &quot;td&quot; refers to &quot;Turbo Diesel&quot;, not a diesel hatchback or touring model (524td, 525td)

&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt; typically includes sport seats, spoiler, aerodynamic body kit, upgraded wheels and Limit Slip Differential on pre-95 model etc.

For example, the BMW 750iL is a fuel-injected 7 Series with a long wheelbase and 6.0&amp;nbsp;liters of displacement. This badge was used for successive generations, E65 and F01.

When 'L' supersedes the series number (e.g. L6, L7, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as a special luxury variant, featuring extended leather and special interior appointments. The L7 is based on the E23 and E38, and the L6 is based on the E24.

When 'X' is capitalised and supersedes the series number (e.g. X3, X5, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as one of BMW's Sports Activity Vehicles (SAV), their brand of [[Crossover (automobile)|crossovers]], featuring [[BMW xDrive|BMW's xDrive]]. The second number in the 'X' series denotes the platform that it is based upon, for instance the X5 is derived from the 5 Series. Unlike BMW cars, the SAV's main badge does not denote engine size, the engine is instead indicated on side badges.

The 'Z' identifies the vehicle as a two seat roadster (e.g. Z1, Z3, Z4, etc.). 'M' variants of 'Z' models have the 'M' as a suffix or prefix, depending on country of sale (e.g. 'Z4 M' is 'M Roadster' in Canada).

Previous X &amp; Z vehicles had 'i' or 'si' following the engine displacement number (denoted in liters). BMW is now globally standardising this nomenclature on X &amp; Z vehicles by using 'sDrive' or 'xDrive' (simply meaning rear or all wheel drive, respectively) followed by two numbers which vaguely represent the vehicle's engine (e.g. Z4 sDrive35i is a rear wheel drive Z4 roadster with a 3.0&amp;nbsp;L twin-turbo fuel-injected engine).&lt;ref&gt;FAQ from the BMW Z4 Press Conference, as reported by BMWBLOG, May 8, 2009. http://www.bmwblog.com/2009/05/08/faq-from-the-recent-bmw-press-conference&lt;/ref&gt;

BMW last used the 's' for the E36 328is, which ceased production in 1999. However, the 's' nomenclature was brought back on the 2011 model year BMW 335is and BMW Z4 sDrive35is. The 335is is a sport-tuned trim with more performance and an optional [[dual clutch transmission]] that slots between the regular 335i and top-of-the-line [[BMW M3|M3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/posteddriving/archive/2010/01/25/preview-2011-160-bmw-335is-coupe.aspx |title=Preview: 2011 BMW 335is Coupe - Posted Driving |publisher=Network.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cunningham |first=Wayne |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/2300-10863_7-10004093.html |title=2011 BMW 335is (photos) - CNET Reviews |publisher=Reviews.cnet.com |date=2010-07-13 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'M' – for [[BMW M|Motorsport]] – identifies the vehicle as a high-performance model of a particular series (e.g. M3, M5, M6, etc.). For example, the M6 is the highest performing vehicle in the 6 Series lineup. Although 'M' cars should be separated into their respective series platforms, it is very common to see 'M' cars grouped together as its own lineup on the official BMW website.

===Exceptions===
There are exceptions to the numbering nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, Robert. BMW San Antonio. BMW Information http://www.mrbimmer.com/bmw.information&lt;/ref&gt;

The M versions of the Sports Activity Vehicles, such as the [[BMW X5 M]], could not follow the regular naming convention since MX5 was used for [[Mazda]]'s [[Mazda MX-5|MX-5 Miata]].

For instance in the 2008 model year, the BMW 125i/128i, 328i, and 528i all had 3.0 naturally aspirated engines ([[BMW N52|N52]]), not a 2,500&amp;nbsp;cc or 2,800&amp;nbsp;cc engine as the series designation number would lead one to believe. The '28' is to denote a detuned engine in the 2008 cars, compared to the 2006 model year '30' vehicles (330i and 530i) whose 3.0 naturally aspirated engines are from the same N52 family but had more output.

The 2008 BMW 335i and 535i also have 3.0-liter engine; however the engines are [[turbocharger|twin-turbocharged]] ([[BMW N54|N54]]) which is not identified by the nomenclature. Nonetheless the '35' indicates a more powerful engine than previous '30' models that have the [[BMW N52|naturally aspirated N52 engine]]. The 2011 BMW 740i and 335is shares the same twin-turbo 3.0 engine from the N54 family but tuned to higher outputs, although the badging is not consistent ('40' and 's').

The E36 and E46 323i and E39 523i had 2.5-liter engines. The E36 318i made after 1996 has a 1.9&amp;nbsp;L engine ([[BMW M44|M44]]) as opposed to the 1.8&amp;nbsp;L ([[BMW M42|M42]]) used in the 1992 to 1995 models.

The badging for recent V8 engines ([[BMW N62|N62]] and [[BMW N63|N63]]) also does not indicate displacement, as the 2006 750i and 2009 750i have 4800&amp;nbsp;cc (naturally aspirated) and 4400&amp;nbsp;cc (twin-turbocharged) engines, respectively.

==Community==

===The arts===
[[File:Alexander Calder, 1975 BMW 3.0 CSL.jpg|thumb|left|1975 BMW 3.0CSL painted by Alexander Calder.]]

Manufacturers employ [[Industrial design|designer]]s for their cars, but BMW has made efforts to gain recognition for exceptional contributions to and support of the arts, including art beyond motor vehicle design.  These efforts typically overlap or complement BMW's marketing and branding campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=BMW Commissions Artists for Auto Werke Art Project |periodical=Art Business News| year= 2000 |volume=27 |issue=13 |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[BMW Headquarters|headquarters building]], designed in 1972 by Karl Schwanzer has become a European icon,&lt;ref name=Patton2009/&gt; and artist [[Gerhard Richter]] created his ''Red, Yellow, Blue'' series of paintings for the building's lobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.stoutbooks.com/cgi-bin/stoutbooks.cgi/76418.html |last1=Friedel |first1= Helmut |first2= Robert|last2= Storr  |title=Gerhard Richter: Red – Yellow – Blue |publisher=Prestel |isbn=9783791338606 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |periodical=[[Boston Globe]] |title=Action Painting, motorized |first= Christopher |last=Shea |date=27 March 2009 |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2009/03/action_painting.html | work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, [[Alexander Calder]] was commissioned to paint the [[BMW 3.0CSL|3.0CSL]] driven by Hervé Poulain at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].

===April Fools===

BMW has garnered a reputation over the years for its [[April Fools Day|April Fools]] pranks, which are printed in the British press every year. In 2010, they ran an advert announcing that customers would be able to order BMWs with different coloured badges to show their affiliation with the political party they supported.

==Overseas subsidiaries==
===South Africa===
BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmw.co.za/products/automobiles/bmw_insights/history.asp|publisher=BMW South Africa|title=Corporate Information: History}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Praetor Monteerders' plant was opened in [[Rosslyn, Gauteng|Rosslyn]], near [[Pretoria]]. BMW initially bought shares in the company, before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the company became '''BMW South Africa''', the first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Three unique models that [[BMW Motorsport]] created for the South African market were the [[BMW E23|E23]] M745i (1983), which used the [[BMW M88|M88]] engine from the [[BMW M1]], the BMW 333i (1986), which added a 6-cylinder 3.2 litre [[BMW M30|M30]] engine to the [[BMW E30|E30]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwplant.co.za/Content/frame_content.jsp@content=http-3a-2f-2fhaf0gau02~5.htm |title=BMW South Africa – Plant Rosslyn |publisher=Bmwplant.co.za |date= |accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|E30]] BMW 325is (1989) which was powered by an [[Alpina]]-derived 2.7 litre engine.

Unlike U.S. manufacturers, such as [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]], which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa. Following the end of [[apartheid]] in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local production of the 5-Series and 7-Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3-Series for the export market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to [[right hand drive]] markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and Hong Kong, as well as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in [[left hand drive]] for export to [[Taiwan]], the United States and [[Iran]], as well as South America.

BMW's with a [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] number starting with &quot;NC0&quot; are manufactured in South Africa.

===United States===
[[File:BMW Zentrum Spartanburg.jpg|thumb|right|BMW [[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]] factory]]

[[BMW Manufacturing Co. Spartanburg|BMW Manufacturing Co]] has been manufacturing the [[BMW X5|X5]] and, more recently, the X6 in [[Greer, South Carolina|Greer]] near [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/10609256128/last-of-first-generation-bmw-x5-manufactured |title=Out with the old, in with the new|publisher=BMW AG|date=2006-10-16|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller X3 has began production in Spartanburg.  BMW's with a [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] number starting with &quot;4US and 5US&quot; are manufactured in Spartanburg.

In 2010 BMW announced that it would spend $750 million to expand operations at the Spartanburg plant.  This expansion will allow production of 240,000 vehicles a year and will make the plant the largest car factory in the United States by number of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennett|first=Jeff|title=BMW to Expand Plant in South Carolina|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 14, 2010|page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
[[BMW India]] was established in 2006 as a sales subsidiary in [[Gurgaon]] (National Capital Region). A state-of-the-art assembly plant for BMW 3 and 5 Series started operation in early 2007 in [[Chennai]]. Construction of the plant started in January 2006 with an initial investment of more than one billion Indian Rupees. The plant started operation in the first quarter of 2007 and produces the different variants of [[BMW 3 Series]] and [[BMW 5 Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Interone Worldwide GmbH |url=http://www.bmw.in/in/en/index_narrowband.html |title=International BMW website |publisher=Bmw.in |date=2006-12-11 |accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
[[Bavarian Auto Group]] is a multinational group of companies established in March 2003 when it was appointed as the sole importer of BMW and Mini in Egypt, with exclusive rights for import, assembly, distribution, sales and after-sales support of BMW products in Egypt.

'''Bornholm''' ({{IPA-da|bɒːnˈhʌlˀm|}}; [[Old Norse]]: ''Burgundaholmr'', &quot;the island of the [[Burgundians]]&quot;) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[island]] in the [[Baltic Sea]] located to the east of (most of) the rest of Denmark, the south of [[Sweden]], and the north of [[Poland]]. The main industries on the island include [[fishing]], arts and crafts like glass making and pottery using locally worked [[clay]], and [[dairy farming]]. [[Tourism]] is important during the summer. The topography of the island consists of dramatic rock formations in the north, sloping down towards “pine and deciduous forests” (greatly damaged by storms in the 1950s) and farmland in the middle and sandy beaches in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Swedish Folktales &amp; Legends |last=Blecher |first=Lone Thygesen |authorlink= |coauthors=George Blecher |year=2004 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location= |isbn=0-8166-4575-2 |pages=xvi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also refers to '''Bornholm Regional Municipality''', the [[municipality]] ({{lang-da|kommune}}) which covers the entire island. Bornholm was one of the three last Danish municipalities not belonging to a [[Counties of Denmark|county]]— the others being [[Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksberg]]. On 1 January 2007, the municipality lost its short-lived (2003 until 2006) county privileges and became part of [[Region Hovedstaden]] (i.e. the ''Copenhagen Capital Region'').

The small islands [[Ertholmene]] are located {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} to the northeast of Bornholm. They do not belong to either a municipality or a region but are administered by the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]].

Strategically located in the [[Baltic Sea]], Bornholm has been a bone of contention usually ruled by Denmark, but also by [[Lübeck]] and [[Sweden]]. The castle ruin [[Hammershus]], on the northwestern tip of the island, is the largest medieval fortress in northern Europe, testament to the importance of its location.

==Language==
{{Main|Bornholmsk}}
Many inhabitants speak ''[[bornholmsk]]'' (Bornholmian), which officially is a [[Danish dialects|dialect of Danish]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Skautrup, ''Det Danske Sprogs Historie'', Gyldendal, 1968, vol. 4, p. 105ff.'''(Danish)'''&lt;/ref&gt; However, among many Bornholmians there is also a strong public sentiment towards having it officially accepted as language, backed by it recently being included among the languages of [[Skåneland]] by UNESCO on its [[Red Book of Endangered Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/regioner/bornholm/nyheder/bornholm/2009/10/25/072142.htm dr.dk, &quot;UNESCO: Bornholmsk er i fare&quot;, October 25 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Bornholmsk retains three [[grammatical genders]], like [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and most dialects of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but unlike standard [[Danish language|Danish]]. Its [[phonology]] includes [[archaism]]s (unstressed {{IPA|[a]}} and internal {{IPA|[d̥, ɡ̊]}}, where other dialects have {{IPA|[ə]}} and {{IPA|[ð̞, ʊ / ɪ]}}) and innovations ({{IPA|[tɕ, dʝ]}} for {{IPA|[kʰ, ɡ̊]}} before and after front-tongue vowels). This renders the dialect difficult to understand for some Danish-speakers. However, [[Swedish (language)|Swedish-speakers]] often consider Bornholmian to be easier to understand than standard Danish. The [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] resembles the [[Scanian dialects]] spoken in the nearby [[Scania]], the southernmost province of [[Sweden]].

== Municipality ==
[[Image:Flag of Denmark Bornholm.svg||left|thumb|180px|Unofficial [[flag of Bornholm]].]]
Bornholm Regional Municipality is the local authority ([[Danish language|Danish]], ''[[Commune (subnational entity)|kommune]]'') covering the entire island. It comprises the five former (1 April 1970 until 2002) municipalities on the island ([[Allinge-Gudhjem]], [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]], [[Nexø]], [[Rønne]] and [[Aakirkeby]]) and the former [[Bornholm County]]. The island had 22 municipalities until March 1970, of which 6 were market cities and 16 parish municipalities. The market city municipalities were supervised by the county and not by the interior ministry as was the case in the rest of Denmark. The seat of the municipal council is the island's main town, Rønne. The first regional mayor was Thoms Thors. The mayor as of 2010 is [[Winni Grosbøll]], a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (''Socialdemokraterne'') [[Politics of Denmark|political party]].

[[Ferry]] services connect Rønne to [[Świnoujście]] ([[Poland]]), [[Sassnitz]] ([[Germany]]), [[Køge]] (near Copenhagen, [[Denmark]]) and [[catamaran]] to [[Ystad]] ([[Sweden]]). [[Simrishamn]] ([[Sweden]]) has a ferry connection during the summer. There are also regular [[catamaran]] services between [[Nexø]] and the Polish ports of [[Kołobrzeg]], [[Łeba]] and [[Ustka]]. There are direct train and bus connections Ystad-Copenhagen, coordinated with the catamaran. There are also air connections from the [[Bornholm Airport]] to Copenhagen and other locations.

Bornholm Regional Municipality was not merged with other municipalities on 1 January 2007 as the result of the nationwide [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform 2007|''Kommunalreformen'' (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007)]], which is quite understandable, since the island, as can be seen on maps, is quite far from the rest of [[Denmark]].

== History ==
[[Image:Burg Hammershus 5.jpg|{{largethumb}}|right|[[Hammershus]] Ruin.]]

In Old Norse the island was known as ''Borgundarholm'', and in ancient Danish especially the island's name was ''Borghand'' or ''Borghund''; these names were related to Old Norse ''borg'' &quot;height&quot; and ''bjarg/berg'' &quot;mountain, rock&quot;, as it is an island that rises high from the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J.P. and D.Q. Adams. ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture''. London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1997: p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Other names known for the island include ''Burgendaland'' (9th century), ''Hulmo'' / ''Holmus'' ([[Adam of Bremen]]), ''Burgundehulm'' (1145), and ''Borghandæholm'' (14th century).&lt;ref&gt;Politikens Nudansk Ordborg (1993), 15th edition, entry &quot;Bornholm&quot; {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred the Great]] uses the form ''Burgenda land''.&lt;ref&gt;King Alfred's Anglo-Saxon version of Orosius, London, 1859, edited by J. Bosworth&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Essai sur l'histoire du peuple burgonde, de Bornholm (Burgundarholm) vers la Bourgogne et les Bourguignons, 1965, by Rene Guichard, published by A. et J. Picard et Cie.&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the [[Burgundians]] are named after Bornholm; the Burgundians were a [[Germanic tribe]] which moved west when the western [[Roman Empire]] collapsed, and occupied and named [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] in [[France]].

[[Image:GudhjemMill.JPG|thumb|140px|left|Windmill in Gudhjem, Bornholm]]
Bornholm formed part of the historical [[Lands of Denmark]] when the nation united out of a series of petty chiefdoms. It was originally administratively part of the province of [[Scania]] and was administered by the [[Scanian Law]] after this was codified in the 13th century. Control over the island evolved into a long-raging dispute between the [[Archbishop of Lund|See of Lund]] and the [[List of Danish monarchs|Danish crown]] culminating in several battles. The first fortress on the island was ''[[Gamleborg]]'' which was replaced by ''[[Lilleborg Castle|Lilleborg]]'', built by the king in 1150. In 1149, the king accepted the transfer of three of the island's four [[Hundred (country subdivision)|herreder]] to the archbishop. In 1250, the archbishop constructed his own fortress, [[Hammershus]]. A campaign launched from it in 1259 conquered the remaining part of the island including Lilleborg. The island's status remained a matter of dispute for an additional 200 years.

[[File:Bornholm-arsdale-windmill.jpg|{{largethumb}}|right|1877&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bornholmsmuseum.dk/mills/sid/holl/arsdale.php Bornholm Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; windmill at [[Aarsdale|Årsdale]]]]
Bornholm was pawned to [[Lübeck]] for 50 years starting 1525. Its first militia, [[Bornholms Milits]] was formed in 1624.

Swedish forces conquered the island in 1645, but returned the island to Denmark in the following peace settlement. After the war in 1658, Denmark ceded the island to Sweden under the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] along with the rest of the Scanian provinces and [[Trøndelag]], and it was occupied by Swedish forces.

A revolt broke out the same year, culminating in [[Villum Clausen]]'s shooting of the Swedish commander [[Johan Printzensköld]] on 8 December 1658.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bornholmsmuseum.dk/1658/1658_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Following the revolt, a deputation of islanders presented the island as a gift to King [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] on the condition that the island would never be ceded again. This status was confirmed in the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|treaty of Copenhagen]] in 1660.

[[Swedish people|Swedes]], notably from [[Småland]] and [[Skåne]], immigrated to the island during the 19th century, seeking work and better conditions. Most of the migrants did not remain on the island.

Bornholm, as a part of [[Denmark]], was captured by Germany relatively early in the [[World War II|Second World War]], and served as a lookout post and listening station during the war, as it was a part of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern front]]. The island's perfect central position in the [[Baltic Sea]] meant that it was an important &quot;natural fortress&quot; between [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]], effectively keeping submarines and destroyers away from Nazi-occupied waters. Several concrete coastal installations were built during the war, and several coastal batteries had tremendous range. However, none of them were ever used, and only a single test shot was fired during the occupation. These remnants of Nazi rule have since then fallen into disrepair and are mostly regarded today as historical curiosities. Many tourists visit the ruins each year, however, providing supplemental income to the tourist industry.
[[Image:Rønne.jpg|{{largethumb}}|right|[[Rønne]], Bornholm.]]
On 22 August 1943 a [[V-1 flying bomb]] (numbered V83, probably launched from a [[Heinkel He 111]]) crashed on Bornholm during a test - the warhead was a dummy made of concrete. This was photographed or sketched by the Danish Naval Officer-in-Charge on Bornholm, Lieutenant Commander Hasager Christiansen. This was the first sign British Intelligence saw of Germany's aspirations to develop flying bombs and rockets - which were to become known as [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and [[Vergeltungswaffe 2|V2]].

Bornholm was heavily bombarded by [[Soviet Army|Soviet forces]] in May 1945. German garrison commander [[Gerhard von Kamptz]] refused to surrender to Soviets, as his orders were to surrender to the Western Allies. The Germans sent several telegrams to [[Copenhagen]] requesting that at least one British soldier should be transferred to Bornholm, so that the Germans could surrender to the western allied forces instead of the Russians. When von Kamptz failed to provide a written capitulation as demanded by the Soviet commanders, Soviet aircraft relentlessly bombed and destroyed more than 800 civilian houses in [[Rønne]] and [[Nexø]] and seriously damaged roughly 3,000 more during 7–8 May 1945.

During the Russian bombing of the two major cities on 7 May and again 8 May, the Danish radio was not allowed to broadcast the news because as it was thought it would spoil the liberation festivities in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;En Ø i krig / An island at war by Børge Kure&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 May Soviet troops landed on the island, and after a short fight, the German garrison (about 12,000 strong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.9may.ru/eng_inform/m9004261|title=Soviet Information Bureau report, 11 May 1945|accessdate=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bornholm.info/Historie/482we.aspx?langId=2|title=Bornholm during World War II|accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet forces left the island on 5 April 1946. These events could be considered to be part of the [[origins of the Cold War]] as much as being part of [[World War II]]. More recently [[NATO]] [[radar]] installations have been placed on the island.

After the evacuation of its forces from Bornholm, the Soviets took the position that &quot;The stationing 'foreign troops' on Bornholm would be considered a declaration of war against the Soviet Union, and that Denmark should keep troops on it at all times to protect it from such foreign aggression&quot;. This policy remained in force also after NATO was formed, and Denmark joined it - i.e. the Soviets accepted the stationing of Danish troops, which were perforce part of NATO but were far from that alliance's most powerful element, but strongly objected to the presence of other NATO troops on the island - particularly, of US troops.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

This caused diplomatic problems at least twice: once when an American [[helicopter]] landed outside the city of [[Svaneke]] due to engine problems in a NATO exercise over the [[Baltic Sea]], and once (sometime between 1999 and 2003) when the Danish government suggested shutting down ''Almegårdens Kaserne'', the local military facility, since &quot;the island could quickly be protected by troops from surrounding areas and has no strategic importance after the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]]&quot;.

[[Image:Hammershus castle.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Hammershus]], a Medieval fortress.]]
The island also hosts some notable examples of 19th and early 20th century architecture, amongst others, about 300 [[wooden]] houses in [[Rønne]] and [[Nexø]], donated by [[Sweden]] after [[World War II]], when the island was repairing damage caused by the war.
The island is home to 15 medieval churches, four of which are Round Churches that display unique artwork and architecture.

==Famous people==
The Danish painter [[Oluf Høst]] was born in [[Svaneke]] in 1884.

The Danish writer and painter [[Gustaf Munch-Petersen]] moved to Bornholm in 1935 and married Lisbeth Hjorth while living on the island.

At age 8, socialist writer [[Martin Andersen Nexø]] moved to the island, and took his last name after the city of [[Nexø]] on its east coast.

[[M.P. Möller]], a pipe-organ builder and manufacturer, was born on Bornholm and lived in a town a few miles south of [[Allinge]].

==Electricity supply ==
Bornholm is connected to the Swedish electricity grid by a submarine 60 kV AC-cable, which is among the longest AC-cables in Europe. This cable is capable to deliver all power consumed on Bornholm. However, Bornholm also generates its own power by small thermal power plants and especially by [[wind turbine]]s.

== Sports ==

Bornholm's geography as an island and moderate climate makes Bornholm an ideal location for sailing and other water based sports.

Bornholm has also become an internationally recognised venue for 'match racing', a sailing sport where two identical (or one design) supplied racing yachts are raced in a high adrenaline one on one dogfight on the water. The '''Danish Open''' event was held in Bornholm in September 2010 at the port town of Ronne on the Western coast of Bornholm. The racing yachts used for the Danish Open event are Danish designed DS37 racing yachts. These highly maneuverable and versatile boats are also used in the Match Cup Sweden event.

The five day Danish Open is a key event in the [[World Match Racing Tour]] calendar which is one of only 3 events awarded 'special event' status by the [[International Sailing Federation]]. The Tour is the world's leading professional 'match racing' series and features a 9 event calendar which crosses 3 continents during the series.

Points accrued during the Danish Open contribute directly to the World Match Racing Tour championship with the winner of the season finale at the Monsoon Cup in Malaysia claiming the ultimate match racing title ISAF World Match Racing Champion.

Match racing unlike other sailing sports is suited to locations like Bornholm due to the racing taking place in close proximity to the shore which provides spectacular heart of the action viewing for the on-shore audience.

==Cultural references==
* The [[Academy Award]]-winning 1987 [[Bille August]] film [[Pelle the Conqueror]], an adaption of [[Martin Andersen Nexø]]'s four volume novel by the same name, is set and was shot on the island.

* A considerable part of the Second World War spy thriller [[Hornet Flight]] by [[Ken Follett]] takes place on Bornholm, depicting the island under German occupation.

{{Literature}}
A '''book''' is a set or collection of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of [[paper]], [[parchment]], or other various material, usually fastened together to hinge at one side. A single sheet within a book is called a [[Recto|leaf]], and each side of a leaf is called a [[page (paper)|page]]. A book produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book ([[e-book]]).

Books may also refer to works of literature, or a main division of such a work. In [[library and information science]], a book is called a [[monograph]], to distinguish it from serial [[periodical]]s such as [[magazine]]s, [[academic journal|journal]]s or [[newspaper]]s. The body of all written works including books is [[literature]]. In [[novel]]s and sometimes other types of books (for example, biographies), a book may be divided into several large sections, also called books (Book 1, Book 2, Book 3, and so on.). A lover of books is usually referred to as a [[bibliophile]], a bibliophilist, or a philobiblist, or, more informally, a [[bookworm]].

A store where [[Bookselling|books are bought and sold]] is a bookstore or bookshop. Books can also be borrowed from [[Lending library|libraries]].

In 2010, [[Google]] estimated that there were approximately 130 million unique books in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2010/08/books-of-world-stand-up-and-be-counted.html |date=August 5, 2010 |title=Books of the world |accessdate=2010-08-15 |quote=After we exclude serials, we can finally count all the books in the world. There are 129,864,880 of them. At least until Sunday. |publisher=[[Google]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''book'' comes from [[Old English]] &quot;bōc&quot; which itself comes from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] root &quot;*bōk-&quot;, [[cognate]] to [[beech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/book |title=book&amp;nbsp;— Definitions from Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see American Heritage Dictionary and Online Etymology Dictionary --&gt;
Similarly, in [[Slavic languages]] (for example, [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]) &quot;буква&quot; (bukva—&quot;letter&quot;) is cognate to &quot;beech&quot;. It is thus conjectured that the earliest [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] writings may have been carved on [[beech]] wood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northvegr.org/holy/b.php Northvegr - Holy Language Lexicon]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Latin word ''codex'', meaning a book in the modern sense (bound and with separate leaves), originally meant &quot;block of wood&quot;.

== History of books ==
{{main|History of books}}

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:Sumerian MS2272 2400BC.jpg|thumb|[[Sumerian language]] cuneiform script [[clay tablet]], 2400–2200 BC]]

When [[History of writing|writing systems]] were invented in [[ancient civilization]]s, nearly everything that could be written upon—stone, [[clay tablet|clay]], tree bark, metal sheets—was used for writing. [[History of the alphabet|Alphabetic writing]] emerged in [[Egypt]] about 5,000 years ago. The Ancient Egyptians would often write on [[papyrus]], a plant grown along the Nile River. At first the words were not separated from each other (''scriptura continua'') and there was no [[punctuation]]. Texts were written from right to left, left to right, and even so that alternate lines read in opposite directions. The technical term for this type of writing is '[[boustrophedon]],' which means literally 'ox-turning' for the way a farmer drives an ox to plough his fields.

==== Scroll ====
{{main|Scroll}}
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian papyrus showing the god [[Osiris]] and the weighing of the heart.]]
[[Papyrus]], a thick [[paper|paper-like]] material made by weaving the stems of the papyrus plant, then pounding the woven sheet with a hammer-like tool, was used for writing in [[Ancient Egypt]], perhaps as early as the [[First Dynasty]], although the first evidence is from the account books of King [[Neferirkare Kakai]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty]] (about 2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papyrus sheets were glued together to form a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]]. Tree bark such as [[Tilia|lime]] (Latin ''liber'', from which also comes [[library]]) and other materials were also used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dard Hunter]]. ''Papermaking: History and Technique of an Ancient Craft New ed.'' Dover Publications 1978, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herodotus]] (History 5:58), the [[Phoenicians]] brought writing and papyrus to Greece around the 10th or 9th century BC. The Greek word for papyrus as writing material (''biblion'') and book (''biblos'') come from the Phoenician port town [[Byblos]], through which papyrus was exported to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', pp. 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; From Greek we also derive the word tome ({{lang-el|τόμος}}), which originally meant a slice or piece and from there began to denote &quot;a roll of papyrus&quot;. ''Tomus'' was used by the Latins with exactly the same meaning as ''volumen'' (see also below the explanation by Isidore of Seville).

Whether made from papyrus, [[parchment]], or paper, scrolls were the dominant form of book in the Hellenistic, Roman, Chinese, and Hebrew cultures. The more modern [[codex]] book format form took over the Roman world by [[late antiquity]], but the scroll format persisted much longer in Asia.

==== Codex ====
{{main|Codex}}
[[File:Herkulaneischer Meister 002b.jpg|thumb|upright|Woman holding a book (or wax tablets) in the form of the [[codex]]. Wall painting from [[Pompeii]], before 79 AD.]]
[[Papyrus]] scrolls were still dominant in the 1st century AD, as witnessed by the findings in [[Pompeii]]. The first written mention of the codex as a form of book is from [[Martial]], in his Apophoreta &lt;small&gt;CLXXXIV&lt;/small&gt; at the end of the century, where he praises its compactness. However the codex never gained much popularity in the pagan Hellenistic world, and only within the Christian community did it gain widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature. Edd. Frances Young, Lewis Ayres, Andrew Louth, Ron White. Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; This change happened gradually during the 3rd and 4th centuries, and the reasons for adopting the codex form of the book are several: the format is more economical, as both sides of the writing material can be used; and it is portable, searchable, and easy to conceal. The Christian [[author]]s may also have wanted to distinguish their writings from the pagan texts written on scrolls.

[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Chinese [[bamboo]] book]]
[[Wax tablet]]s were the normal writing material in schools, in accounting, and for taking notes. They had the advantage of being reusable: the wax could be melted, and reformed into a blank. The custom of binding several wax tablets together (Roman ''pugillares'') is a possible precursor for modern books (i.e. codex).&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology of the word codex (block of wood) also suggests that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In the 5th century, [[Isidore of Seville]] explained the relation between codex, book and scroll in his Etymologiae (VI.13): &quot;A codex is composed of many books; a book is of one scroll. It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (''codex'') of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches.&quot;

=== Middle Ages ===
==== Manuscripts ====
{{main|Manuscript}}
[[File:RomanVirgilFolio014rVergilPortrait.jpg|thumb|right|Folio 14 recto of the 5th century [[Vergilius Romanus]] contains an author portrait of [[Virgil]]. Note the [[bookcase]] (''capsa''), reading stand and the text written without word spacing in [[rustic capitals]].]]
The fall of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 5th century A.D. saw the decline of the [[culture of ancient Rome]]. Papyrus became difficult to obtain due to lack of contact with Egypt, and [[parchment]], which had been used for centuries, became the main writing material.

Monasteries carried on the [[Latin literature|Latin]] writing tradition in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. [[Cassiodorus]], in the monastery of Vivarium (established around 540), stressed the importance of copying texts.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', pp. 207–208.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict of Nursia]], in his ''[[Rule of St Benedict|Regula Monachorum]]'' (completed around the middle of the 6th century) later also promoted reading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Maynard]]. ''Saint Benedict and His Monks''. Staples Press Ltd 1956, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rule of St. Benedict (Ch. &lt;small&gt;XLVIII&lt;/small&gt;), which set aside certain times for reading, greatly influenced the monastic culture of the [[Middle Ages]] and is one of the reasons why the clergy were the predominant readers of books. The tradition and style of the Roman Empire still dominated, but slowly the peculiar medieval book culture emerged.

Before the invention and adoption of the [[printing press]], almost all books were copied by hand, which made books expensive and comparatively rare. Smaller monasteries usually had only a few dozen books, medium-sized perhaps a few hundred. By the 9th century, larger collections held around 500 volumes and even at the end of the Middle Ages, the papal library in [[Avignon]] and Paris library of [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] held only around 2,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Martin D. Joachim. Historical Aspects of Cataloguing and Classification. Haworth Press 2003, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|left|Burgundian author and scribe [[Jean Miélot]], from his ''Miracles de Notre Dame'', 15th century.]]

The ''[[scriptorium]]'' of the monastery was usually located over the [[chapter house]]. Artificial light was forbidden for fear it may damage the manuscripts. There were five types of scribes:
* ''Calligraphers'', who dealt in fine book production
* ''Copyists'', who dealt with basic production and correspondence
* ''Correctors'', who collated and compared a finished book with the manuscript from which it had been produced
* ''Illuminators'', who painted illustrations
* ''Rubricators'', who painted in the red letters

The bookmaking process was long and laborious. The parchment had to be prepared, then the unbound pages were planned and ruled with a blunt tool or lead, after which the text was written by the [[scribe]], who usually left blank areas for illustration and [[rubrication]]. Finally, the book was bound by the [[bookbinder]].&lt;ref&gt;Edith Diehl. ''Bookbinding: Its Background and Technique''. Dover Publications 1980, pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Milkau Bücherschrank mit angekettetem Buch aus der Bibliothek von Cesena 109-2.jpg|thumb|right|Desk with chained books in the [[Library]] of [[Cesena]], [[Italy]].]]

Different types of ink were known in antiquity, usually prepared from soot and gum, and later also from [[gall]] nuts and [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron vitriol]]. This gave writing a brownish black color, but black or brown were not the only colors used. There are texts written in red or even gold, and different colors were used for illumination. Sometimes the whole parchment was colored purple, and the text was written on it with gold or silver (for example, [[Codex Argenteus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish monks introduced spacing between words in the 7th century. This facilitated reading, as these monks tended to be less familiar with Latin. However, the use of spaces between words did not become commonplace before the 12th century. It has been argued that the use of spacing between words shows the transition from semi-vocalized reading into silent reading.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Saenger. ''Space Between Words: The Origins of Silent Reading''. Stanford University Press 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first books used [[parchment]] or [[vellum parchment|vellum]] ([[calf skin]]) for the pages. The book covers were made of wood and covered with leather. Because dried parchment tends to assume the form it had before processing, the books were fitted with clasps or straps. During the later [[Middle Ages]], when public libraries appeared, up to 18th century, books were often chained to a bookshelf or a [[desk]] to prevent theft. These chained books are called ''libri catenati''.

At first, books were copied mostly in bars, one at a time. With the rise of universities in the 13th century, the [[Manuscript culture]] of the time led to an increase in the demand for books, and a new system for copying books appeared. The books were divided into unbound leaves (''pecia''), which were lent out to different copyists, so the speed of book production was considerably increased. The system was maintained by secular [[stationery|stationers]] guilds, which produced both religious and non-religious material.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography'', pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] has kept the art of the scribe alive up to the present. According to Jewish tradition, the [[Torah]] scroll placed in a [[synagogue]] must be written by hand on parchment, and a printed book would not do, though the congregation may use printed prayer books, and printed copies of the Scriptures are used for study outside the [[synagogue]]. A [[sofer]] (scribe) is a highly respected member of any observant Jewish community.

==== Paper books ====
{{Cite check|section|date=September 2010}}
The [[Arab]]s produced and bound books in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], developing advanced techniques in ([[Arabic calligraphy]]), [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and [[bookbinding]]. A number of cities in the medieval Islamic world had book production centers and book markets. [[Marrakech]], Morocco, had a street named ''Kutubiyyin'' or book sellers which contained more than 100 bookshops in the 12th century{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}; the famous [[Koutoubia Mosque]] is named so because of its location in this street.

The medieval [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] also developed a unique method of reproducing reliable copies of a book in large quantities, known as [[Proofreading|check reading]], in contrast to the traditional method of a single scribe producing only a single copy of a single manuscript, as was the case in other societies at the time. In the Islamic check reading method, only &quot;authors could authorize copies, and this was done in public sessions in which the copyist read the copy aloud in the presence of the author, who then certified it as accurate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165–186 [43]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this check-reading system, &quot;an author might produce a dozen or more copies from a single reading,&quot; and with two or more readings, &quot;more than one hundred copies of a single book could easily be produced.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165–186 [44]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern paper books are printed on [[printing and writing paper|papers]] which are designed specifically for the [[publication]] of printed books. Traditionally, book papers are off white or low white papers (easier to read), are opaque to minimise the show through of text from one side of the page to the other and are (usually) made to tighter caliper or thickness specifications, particularly for case bound books. Typically, books papers are light weight papers 60 to 90 g/m² and often specified by their caliper/substance ratios (volume basis). For example, a bulky 80 g/m² paper may have a caliper of 120 micrometres (0.12&amp;nbsp;mm) which would be Volume 15 (120×10/80) where as a low bulk 80 g/m² may have a caliper of 88 micrometres, giving a volume 11. This volume basis then allows the calculation of a books PPI (printed pages per inch) which is an important factor for the design of book jackets and the binding of the finished book. Different paper qualities are used as book paper depending on type of book: [[Machine finished coated paper]]s, [[woodfree uncoated paper]]s, [[coated fine paper]]s and [[special fine paper]]s are common paper grades.

==== Wood block printing ====
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from [[Tang Dynasty]] China, 868 AD ([[British Museum]])]]
In [[woodblock printing]], a relief image of an entire page was carved into blocks of wood, inked, and used to print copies of that page. This method originated in China, in the [[Han dynasty]] (before 220AD), as a method of [[printing]] on [[textiles]] and later [[paper]], and was widely used throughout [[East Asia]]. The oldest dated book printed by this method is ''[[The Diamond Sutra]]'' (868 AD).

The method (called ''[[Woodcut]]'' when used in art) arrived in China in the early 14th century. Books (known as [[Woodblock printing|block-books]]), as well as [[playing-cards]] and [[old master print|religious pictures]], began to be produced by this method. Creating an entire book was a painstaking process, requiring a hand-carved block for each page; and the wood blocks tended to crack, if stored for long. The monks or people who wrote them were paid highly.

==== Movable type and incunabula ====
{{main|Movable type|Incunabulum}}
[[File:SelectedTeachingsofBuddhistSagesandSonMasters1377.jpg|thumb|&quot;Selected Teachings of Buddhist Sages and Son Masters&quot;, the earliest known book printed with movable metal type, 1377. [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].]]

The Chinese inventor [[Bi Sheng]] made [[movable type]] of earthenware circa 1045, but there are no known surviving examples of his printing. Metal movable type was invented in [[Korea]] during the [[Goryeo Dynasty]] (around 1230), but was not widely used: one reason being the enormous [[Chinese written language|Chinese]] character set. Around 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]]. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce, and more widely available.

Early printed books, single sheets and images which were created before the year 1501 in Europe are known as [[incunabula]]. ''A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in A.D. 330.''&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, Michael, &quot;Printing&quot; in ''A History of Technology'', Vol 2. ''From the Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution'', edd. Charles Singer ''et al.'' (Oxford 1957), p. 377. Cited from [[Elizabeth L. Eisenstein]], ''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change'' (Cambridge University, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern world ===
Steam-powered printing presses became popular in the early 19th century. These machines could print 1,100 sheets per hour, but workers could only set 2,000 letters per hour.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Monotype]] and [[linotype machine|linotype]] typesetting machines were introduced in the late 19th century. They could set more than 6,000 letters per hour and an entire line of type at once.

The centuries after the 15th century were thus spent on improving both the printing press and the conditions for [[freedom of the press]] through the gradual relaxation of restrictive censorship laws. See also [[intellectual property]], [[public domain]], [[copyright]]. In mid-20th century, European book production had risen to over 200,000 titles per year.

{{See also|Publishing}}
[[File:bookspine.jpg|thumb|The [[Bookbinding|spine]] of the book is an important aspect in book design, especially in the cover design. When the books are stacked up or stored in a shelf, the details on the spine is the only visible surface that contains the information about the book. In stores, it is the details on the spine that attract buyers' attention first.]]

The methods used for the printing and binding of books continued fundamentally unchanged from the 15th century into the early years of the 20th century. While there was of course more [[mechanization]], Gutenberg would have had no difficulty in understanding what was going on if he had visited a [[book printer]] in [[1900]].

Gutenberg’s invention was the use of movable metal types, assembled into words, lines, and pages and then printed by [[letterpress]]. In letterpress [[printing ink]] is spread onto the tops of raised metal type, and is transferred onto a sheet of paper which is pressed against the type. Sheet-fed letterpress printing is still available but tends to be used for collector’s books and is now more of an art form than a commercial technique (see [[Letterpress]]).

Today, the majority of books are printed by offset [[lithography]] in which an image of the material to be printed is photographically or digitally transferred to a flexible metal plate where it is developed to exploit the antipathy between [[grease]] (the ink) and water. When the plate is mounted on the press, water is spread over it. The developed areas of the plate repel water thus allowing the ink to adhere to only those parts of the plate which are to print. The ink is then offset onto a rubbery blanket (to prevent water from soaking the paper) and then finally to the paper.

When a book is printed the pages are laid out on the plate so that after the printed sheet is folded the pages will be in the correct sequence. Books tend to be manufactured nowadays in a few standard sizes. The [[Book size|sizes of books]] are usually specified as “trim size”: the size of the page after the sheet has been folded and trimmed. Trimming involves cutting approximately 1/8” off top, bottom and fore-edge (the edge opposite to the spine) as part of the binding process in order to remove the folds so that the pages can be opened. The standard sizes result from sheet sizes (therefore machine sizes) which became popular 200 or 300 years ago, and have come to dominate the industry. The basic standard commercial book sizes in [[US|America]], always expressed as width × height, are:
4¼” × 7” (rack size paperback), 5⅛” × 7⅝” ([[digest size]] [[paperback]]), 5½” × 8¼”, 5½” × 8½”, 6⅛” × 9¼”, 7” × 10”, and 8½” × 11”. These “standard” trim sizes will often vary slightly depending on the particular printing presses used, and on the imprecision of the trimming operation. Of course other trim sizes are available, and some [[publisher]]s favor sizes not listed here which they might nominate as “standard” as well, such as 6” × 9”, 8” × 10”. In Britain the equivalent standard sizes differ slightly, as well as now being expressed in millimeters, and with height preceding width. Thus the UK equivalent of 6⅛” × 9¼” is 234 × 156&amp;nbsp;mm. British conventions in this regard prevail throughout the English speaking world, except for USA. The European book manufacturing industry works to a completely different set of standards.

Some books, particularly those with shorter runs (i.e. of which fewer copies are to be made) will be printed on sheet-fed offset presses, but most books are now printed on web presses, which are fed by a continuous roll of paper, and can consequently print more copies in a shorter time. On a sheet-fed press a stack of sheets of paper stands at one end of the press, and each sheet passes through the press individually. The paper will be printed on both sides and delivered, flat, as a stack of paper at the other end of the press. These sheets then have to be folded on another machine which uses bars, rollers and cutters to fold the sheet up into one or more signatures. A signature is a section of a book, usually of 32 pages, but sometimes 16, 48 or even 64 pages. After the signatures are all folded they are gathered: placed in sequence in bins over a circulating belt onto which one signature from each bin is dropped. Thus as the line circulates a complete “book” is collected together in one stack, next to another, and another.

A [[web press]] carries out the folding itself, delivering bundles of signatures ready to go into the gathering line. Notice that when the book is being printed it is being printed one (or two) signatures at a time, not one complete book at a time. Thus if there are to be 10,000 copies printed, the press will run 10,000 of the first form (the pages imaged onto the first plate and its back-up plate, representing one or two signatures), then 10,000 of the next form, and so on till all the signatures have been printed. Actually, because there is a known average spoilage rate in each of the steps in the book’s progress through the manufacturing system, if 10,000 books are to be made, the printer will print between 10,500 and 11,000 copies so that subsequent spoilage will still allow the delivery of the ordered quantity of books. Sources of spoilage tend to be mainly make-readies.

A make-ready is the preparatory work carried out by the pressmen to get the printing press up to the required quality of [[Impression (publishing)|impression]]. Included in make-ready is the time taken to mount the plate onto the machine, clean up any mess from the previous job, and get the press up to speed. The main part of making-ready is however getting the ink/water balance right, and ensuring that the inking is even across the whole width of the paper. This is done by running paper through the press and printing waste pages while adjusting the press to improve quality. [[Densitometer]]s are used to ensure even inking and consistency from one form to another. As soon as the pressman decides that the printing is correct, all the make-ready sheets will be discarded, and the press will start making books. Similar make readies take place in the folding and binding areas, each involving spoilage of paper.

After the signatures are folded and gathered, they move into the [[bindery]]. In the middle of the last century there were still many trade binders&amp;nbsp;– stand-alone binding companies which did no printing, specializing in binding alone. At that time, largely because of the dominance of letterpress printing, the pattern of the industry was for typesetting and printing to take place in one location, and binding in a different factory. When type was all metal, a typical book’s worth of type would be bulky, fragile and heavy. The less it was moved in this condition the better: so it was almost invariable that printing would be carried out in the same location as the typesetting. Printed sheets on the other hand could easily be moved. Now, because of the increasing [[computerization]] of the process of preparing a book for the printer, the typesetting part of the job has flowed upstream, where it is done either by separately contracting companies working for the publisher, by the publishers themselves, or even by the authors. Mergers in the book manufacturing industry mean that it is now unusual to find a bindery which is not also involved in book printing (and vice versa).

If the book is a [[hardcover|hardback]] its path through the bindery will involve more points of activity than if it is a [[paperback]]. A paperback binding line (a number of pieces of machinery linked by conveyor belts) involves few steps. The gathered signatures, book blocks, will be fed into the line where they will one by one be gripped by plates converging from each side of the book, turned spine up and advanced towards a gluing station. En route the spine of the book block will be ground off leaving a roughened edge to the tightly gripped collection of pages. The grinding leaves fibers which will grip onto the glue which is then spread onto the spine of the book. Covers then meet up with the book blocks, and one cover is dropped onto the glued spine of each book block, and is pressed against the spine by rollers. The book is then carried forward to the trimming station, where a three-knife trimmer will simultaneously cut the top and bottom and the fore-edge of the paperback to leave clear square edges. The books are then packed into cartons, or packed on skids, and shipped.

Binding a hardback is more complicated. Look at a hardback book and you will see the cover overlaps the pages by about 1/8” all round. These overlaps are called squares. The blank piece of paper inside the cover is called the endpaper, or endsheet: it is of somewhat stronger paper than the rest of the book as it is the endpapers that hold the book into the case. The endpapers will be tipped to the first and last signatures before the separate signatures are placed into the bins on the gathering line. Tipping involves spreading some glue along the spine edge of the folded endpaper and pressing the endpaper against the signature. The gathered signatures are then glued along the spine, and the book block is trimmed, like the paperback, but will continue after this to the rounder and backer. The book block together with its endpapers will be gripped from the sides and passed under a roller with presses it from side to side, smashing the spine down and out around the sides so that the entire book takes on a rounded cross section: convex on the spine, concave at the fore-edge, with “ears” projecting on either side of the spine. Then the spine is glued again, a paper liner is stuck to it and headbands and footbands are applied. Next a crash lining (an open weave cloth somewhat like a stronger cheesecloth) is usually applied, overlapping the sides of the spine by an inch or more. Finally the inside of the case, which has been constructed and foil-stamped off-line on a separate machine, is glued on either side (but not on the spine area) and placed over the book block. This entire sandwich is now gripped from the outside and pressed together to form a solid bond between the endpapers and the inside of the case. The crash lining, which is glued to the spine of the pages, but not the spine of the case, is held between the endpapers and the case sides, and in fact provides most of the strength holding the book block into the case. The book will then be [[book jacket|jacketed]] (most often by hand, allowing this stage to be an inspection stage also) before being packed ready for shipment.

The sequence of events can vary slightly, and usually the entire sequence does not occur in one continuous pass through a binding line. What has been described above is unsewn binding, now increasingly common. The signatures of a book can also be held together by Smyth sewing. Needles pass through the spine fold of each signature in succession, from the outside to the center of the fold, sewing the pages of the signature together and each signature to its neighbors. McCain sewing, often used in schoolbook binding, involves drilling holes through the entire book and sewing through all the pages from front to back near the spine edge. Both of these methods mean that the folds in the spine of the book will not be ground off in the binding line. This is true of another technique, notch binding, where gashes about an inch long are made at intervals through the fold in the spine of each signature, parallel to the spine direction. In the binding line glue is forced into these “notches” right to the center of the signature, so that every pair of pages in the signature is bonded to every other one, just as in the Smyth sewn book. The rest of the binding process is similar in all instances. Sewn and notch bound books can be bound as either hardbacks or paperbacks.

Making cases happens off-line and prior to the book’s arrival at the binding line. In the most basic case making, two pieces of cardboard are placed onto a glued piece of cloth with a space between them into which is glued a thinner board cut to the width of the spine of the book. The overlapping edges of the cloth (about 5/8” all round) are folded over the boards, and pressed down to adhere. After case making the stack of cases will go to the foil stamping area. Metal dies, photoengraved elsewhere, are mounted in the stamping machine and rolls of foil are positioned to pass between the dies and the case to be stamped. Heat and pressure cause the foil to detach from its backing and adhere to the case. Foils come in various shades of gold and silver and in a variety pigment colors, and by careful setup quite elaborate effects can be achieved by using different rolls of foil on the one book. Cases can also be made from paper which has been printed separately and then protected with clear film lamination. A three-piece case is made similarly but has a different material on the spine and overlapping onto the sides: so it starts out as three pieces of material, one each of a cheaper material for the sides and the different, stronger material for the spine.

Recent developments in book manufacturing include the development of digital printing. Book pages are printed, in much the same way as an office copier works, using [[toner]] rather than ink. Each book is printed in one pass, not as separate signatures. Digital printing has permitted the manufacture of much smaller quantities than offset, in part because of the absence of make readies and of spoilage. One might think of a web press as printing quantities over 2000, quantities from 250 to 2000 being printed on sheet-fed presses, and digital presses doing quantities below 250. These numbers are of course only approximate and will vary from supplier to supplier, and from book to book depending on its characteristics. Digital printing has opened up the possibility of print-on-demand, where no books are printed until after an order is received from a customer.

=== Digital format ===
The term [[e-book]] is a contraction of &quot;electronic book&quot;; it refers to a digital version of a conventional print book. An e-book is usually made available through the internet, but also on CD-ROM and other forms. E-Books may be read either via a computer or by means of a portable book display device known as an e-book reader, such as the [[Sony Reader]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble Nook]] or the [[Amazon Kindle]]. These devices attempt to mimic the experience of reading a print book.

Throughout the 20th century, libraries have faced an ever-increasing rate of publishing, sometimes called an [[information explosion]]. The advent of [[electronic publishing]] and the [[Internet]] means that much new information is not printed in paper books, but is made available online through a [[digital library]], on [[CD-ROM]], or in the form of e-books. An [[on-line book]] is an e-book that is available online through the internet.

Though many books are produced digitally, most digital versions are not available to the public, and there is no decline in the rate of paper publishing {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. There is an effort, however, to convert books that are in the [[public domain]] into a digital medium for unlimited redistribution and infinite availability. This effort is spearheaded by [[Project Gutenberg]] combined with [[Distributed Proofreaders]].

There have also been new developments in the process of publishing books. Technologies such as [[print on demand]], which make it possible to print as few as one book at a time, have made self-publishing much easier and more affordable. On-demand publishing has allowed publishers, by avoiding the high costs of warehousing, to keep low-selling books in print rather than declaring them out of print.

A [[bookmark]] is a thin marker, commonly made of paper or card, used to keep one's place in a book. Bookmarks were used throughout the medieval period,&lt;ref&gt;For a 9th century Carolingian bookmark see: {{Cite book| publisher = Ashgate

A.| title = The archaeology of medieval bookbinding| location = Aldershot| year = 1999}} For a 15th century bookmark see Medeltidshandskrift 34, Lund University Library.&lt;/ref&gt; consisting usually of a small parchment strip attached to the edge of folio (or a piece of cord attached to headband). Bookmarks in the 18th and 19th centuries were narrow silk ribbons bound into the book and become widespread in the 1850s. They were usually made from silk, embroidered fabrics or leather. Not until the 1880s did paper and other materials become more common.

Some large reference books such as dictionaries, may have a [[thumb index]] which is a round cutout in the pages with some printing, allowing the user to see approximately where the wanted entry may be, and open the book to the appropriate section, without looking at the table of context, or index.

The process of physically assembling a book from a number of folded or unfolded sheets of paper is [[bookbinding]].

== Sizes ==
{{main|Book size}}
[[File:Codex Gigas facsimile.jpg|thumb|Real-size [[facsimile]] of [[Codex Gigas]]]]
[[File:Kyauksa.JPG|thumb|The [[world's largest book]]]]
The size of a modern book is based on the printing area of a common flatbed press. The pages of type were arranged and clamped in a frame, so that when printed on a sheet of paper the full size of the press, the pages would be right side up and in order when the sheet was folded, and the folded edges trimmed.

The most common book sizes are:
* Quarto (4to): the sheet of paper is folded twice, forming four leaves (eight pages) approximately 11-13&amp;nbsp;inches (ca 30&amp;nbsp;cm) tall
* Octavo (8vo): the most common size for current hardcover books. The sheet is folded three times into eight leaves (16 pages) up to 9 ¾&quot; (ca 23 cm) tall.
* DuoDecimo (12mo): a size between 8vo and 16mo, up to 7 ¾&quot; (ca 18&amp;nbsp;cm) tall
* Sextodecimo (16mo): the sheet is folded four times, forming 16 leaves (32 pages) up to 6 ¾&quot; (ca 15 cm) tall

Sizes smaller than 16mo are:
* 24mo: up to 5 ¾&quot; (ca 13&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* 32mo: up to 5&quot; (ca 12&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* 48mo: up to 4&quot; (ca 10&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* 64mo: up to 3&quot; (ca 8&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.

Small books can be called '''booklets'''.

Sizes larger than quarto are:
* Folio: up to 15&quot; (ca 38&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* Elephant Folio: up to 23&quot; (ca 58&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* Atlas Folio: up to 25&quot; (ca 63&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* Double Elephant Folio: up to 50&quot; (ca 127&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.

The largest extant medieval manuscript in the world is [[Codex Gigas]] 92 × 50 × 22&amp;nbsp;cm. The [[world's largest book]] made of stone is in [[Kuthodaw Pagoda]] ([[Myanmar]]).

== Types of books ==
=== Types of books according to their contents ===
[[File:Polish sci fi fantasy books.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Novel]]s in a [[Poland|Polish]] [[bookstore]]]]
A common separation by content are [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]]al books. By no means are books limited to this classification, but it is a separation that can be found in most [[collection (museum)|collections]], [[library|libraries]], and [[bookstore]]s.

==== Fiction ====
Many of the books published today are fictitious stories. They are in-part or completely untrue or [[fantasy]]. Historically, paper production was considered too expensive to be used for [[entertainment]]. An increase in global [[literacy]] and [[printing|print]] technology led to the increased publication of books for the purpose of entertainment, and allegorical [[social commentary]]. Most fiction is additionally categorized by [[genre]].

The '''[[novel]]''' is the most common form of fictional book. Novels are stories that typically feature a [[plot (narrative)|plot]], [[setting (fiction)|setting]], [[theme (literature)|themes]] and [[character (arts)|characters]]. Stories and narrative are not restricted to any topic; a novel can be whimsical, serious or [[controversy|controversial]]. The novel has had a tremendous impact on entertainment and [[publishing]] [[market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Media Business; Publishers Worry After Fiction Sales Weaken | author = Edwin Mcdowell | date = 1989-10-30 | work = New York Times

A [[Short story]] may be any length up to 10,000 words, but these word lengths are not universally established.

'''[[Comic book]]s''' or '''[[graphic novel]]s''' are books in which the story is not told, but illustrated.

==== Non-fiction ====
[[File:Stefan Ramult-Pomeranian Dictionary.png|upright|thumb|left|A page from a [[dictionary]]]]
In a library, a [[reference book]] is a general type of non-fiction book which provides information as opposed to telling a story, essay, commentary, or otherwise supporting a point of view. An [[almanac]] is a very general reference book, usually one-volume, with lists of data and information on many topics. An [[encyclopedia]] is a book or set of books designed to have more in-depth articles on many topics. A book listing [[word]]s, their [[etymology]], meanings, and other information is called a [[dictionary]]. A book which is a collection of [[map]]s is an [[atlas (cartography)|atlas]]. A more specific reference book with tables or lists of data and information about a certain topic, often intended for professional use, is often called a [[handbook]]. Books which try to list references and abstracts in a certain broad area may be called an [[index (publishing)|index]], such as ''Engineering Index'', or [[abstract (summary)|abstracts]] such as chemical abstracts and biological abstracts.
[[File:Atlas - book.jpg|right|thumb|An [[atlas (cartography)|atlas]]]]

Books with technical information on how to do something or how to use some equipment are called [[instruction manual]]s. Other popular [[how-to]] books include [[cookbook]]s and [[home improvement]] books.

Students typically store and carry [[textbook]]s and [[schoolbooks]] for study purposes. [[Elementary school]] pupils often use [[workbook]]s, which are published with spaces or blanks to be filled by them for study or [[homework]]. In [[United States|US]] [[higher education]], it is common for a student to take an exam using a [[blue book exam|blue book]].

[[File:Friedrich Kellner diary Oct 6, 1939 p3.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A page from a [[notebook]] used as hand written [[diary]]]]

There is a large set of books that are made only to write private ideas, notes, and accounts. These books are rarely published and are typically destroyed or remain private. [[Notebook]]s are blank papers to be written in by the user. [[Student]]s and [[writer]]s commonly use them for taking notes. [[Scientist]]s and other researchers use [[lab notebook]]s to record their notes. They often feature spiral coil bindings at the edge so that pages may easily be torn out.

[[File:MichYellowBooks.JPG|thumb|A [[Telephone Directory]], with business and residence listings.]]

[[Address book]]s, [[phone book]]s, and [[meeting|calendar/appointment]] books are commonly used on a daily basis for recording appointments, meetings and personal [[Address (geography)|contact information]].

Books for recording periodic entries by the user, such as daily information about a journey, are called [[logbook]]s or simply logs. A similar book for writing the owner's daily private personal events, information, and ideas is called a [[diary]] or [[personal journal]].

[[Business]]es use [[accounting]] books such as journals and [[ledger]]s to record financial data in a practice called [[bookkeeping]].

==== Other types ====
There are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system. [[photograph album|Albums]] are books for holding a group of items belonging to a particular theme, such as a set of [[photograph]]s, card collections, and memorabilia. One common example is [[stamp album]]s, which are used by many hobbyists to protect and organize their collections of [[postage stamps]]. Such albums are often made using removable plastic pages held inside in a ringed binder or other similar smolder.

[[Hymnal]]s are books with collections of [[music]]al [[hymn]]s that can typically be found in [[church (building)|churches]]. [[Prayer book (disambiguation)|Prayerbooks]] or [[missal]]s are books that contain written [[prayer]]s and are commonly carried by [[monk]]s, [[nun]]s, and other devoted followers or [[clergy]].

=== Types of books according to their binding or cover ===
[[File:Latin dictionary.jpg|thumb|[[Hardcover]] books]]
[[File:Borders bookshelf.jpg|thumb|[[Paperback]] books]]

[[Hardcover]] books have a stiff binding. [[Paperback]] books have cheaper, flexible covers which tend to be less durable. An alternative to paperback is the glossy cover, otherwise known as a dust cover, found on magazines, and comic books. Spiral-bound books are bound by spirals made of metal or plastic. Examples of spiral-bound books include: teachers' manuals and [[puzzle book]]s ([[crossword]]s, [[sudoku]]).

[[Publishing]] is a process for producing pre-printed books, magazines, and newspapers for the reader/user to buy.

Publishers may produce low-cost, pre-publication copies known as [[galley proof|galleys]] or 'bound proofs' for promotional purposes, such as generating reviews in advance of publication. Galleys are usually made as cheaply as possible, since they are not intended for sale.

== Collections of books ==
{{main|Library}}
[[File:Celsus-Bibliothek2.jpg|thumb|[[Celsus Library]] was built in 135 AD and could house around 12,000 scrolls.]]
Private or personal libraries made up of non-fiction and fiction books, (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in [[archive]]s) first appeared in [[classical Greece]]. In ancient world the maintaining of a [[library]] was usually (but not exclusively) the privilege of a wealthy individual. These libraries could have been either private or public, i.e. for people who were interested in using them. The difference from a modern [[public library]] lies in the fact that they were usually not funded from public sources. It is estimated that in the city of Rome at the end of the 3rd century there were around 30 public libraries. Public libraries also existed in other cities of the ancient [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean region]] (for example, [[Library of Alexandria]]).&lt;ref&gt;Miriam A. Drake, ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science'' (Marcel Dekker, 2003), &quot;Public Libraries, History&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the Middle Ages, monasteries and universities had also libraries that could be accessible to general public. Typically not the whole collection was available to public, the books could not be borrowed and often were chained to reading stands to prevent theft.

The beginning of modern public library begins around 15th century when individuals started to donate books to towns.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam A. Drake, ''Encyclopedia of Library'', &quot;Public Libraries, History&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of a [[public library]] system in the United States started in the late 19th century and was much helped by donations from [[Andrew Carnegie]]. This reflected classes in a society: The poor or the middle class had to access most books through a public library or by other means while the rich could afford to have a [[private library]] built in their homes.  In the United States the Boston Public Library 1852 ''Report of the Trustees'' established the justification for the public library as a tax-supported institution intended to extend educational opportunity and provide for general culture. &lt;ref&gt;McCook, Kathleen de la Peña (2011), ''Introduction to Public Librarianship'', 2nd ed., p. 23 New York, Neal-Schuman.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The advent of [[paperback]] books in the 20th century led to an explosion of popular publishing. Paperback books made owning books affordable for many people. Paperback books often included works from genres that had previously been published mostly in [[pulp magazines]]. As a result of the low cost of such books and the spread of bookstores filled with them (in addition to the creation of a smaller market of extremely cheap used paperbacks) owning a private library ceased to be a status symbol for the rich.

In library and booksellers' catalogues, it is common to include an abbreviation such as &quot;Crown 8vo&quot; to indicate the [[paper size]] from which the book is made.

When rows of books are lined on a book holder, [[bookend]]s are sometimes needed to keep them from slanting.

== Identification and classification ==
During the 20th century, [[librarian]]s were concerned about keeping track of the many books being added yearly to the [[Gutenberg Galaxy]]. Through a global society called the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), they devised a series of tools including the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]] (ISBD).

[[File:ISBN.JPG|thumb|left|[[ISBN]] number with [[barcode]]]]

Each book is specified by an International Standard Book Number, or [[ISBN]], which is unique to every edition of every book produced by participating publishers, world wide. It is managed by the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN&lt;/nowiki&gt; Society. An ISBN has four parts: the first part is the country code, the second the [[publisher]] code, and the third the title code. The last part is a [[check digit]], and can take values from 0–9 and X (10). The [[European Article Number|EAN]] [[Barcode]]s numbers for books are derived from the ISBN by prefixing 978, for [[Bookland]], and calculating a new check digit.

Commercial publishers in industrialized countries generally assign ISBNs to their books, so buyers may presume that the ISBN is part of a total international system, with no exceptions. However many government publishers, in industrial as well as developing countries, do not participate fully in the ISBN system, and publish books which do not have ISBNs.

A large or public collection requires a [[Library catalog|catalogue]]. Codes called &quot;call numbers&quot; relate the books to the catalogue, and determine their locations on the shelves. Call numbers are based on a [[Library classification]] system. The call number is placed on the spine of the book, normally a short distance before the bottom, and inside.

Institutional or national standards, such as [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]/[[NISO]] Z39.41 - 1997, establish the correct way to place information (such as the title, or the name of the author) on book spines, and on &quot;shelvable&quot; book-like objects, such as containers for [[DVD]]s, [[video tape]]s and [[Computer software|software]].

[[File:SanDiegoCityCollegeLearingRecourceCity-bookshelf.jpg|thumb|right|Books on library shelves with [[bookend]]s, and call numbers visible on the spines]]

One of the earliest and most widely known systems of cataloguing books is the [[Dewey Decimal System]]. Another widely known system is the [[Library of Congress Classification]] system. Both systems are biased towards subjects which were well-represented in US libraries when they were developed, and hence have problems handling new subjects, such as computing, or subjects relating to other cultures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Information about books and authors can be stored in databases like [[online general-interest book database]]s.

[[Metadata]] about a book may include its ISBN or other classification number (see above), the names of contributors (author, editor, illustrator) and publisher, its date and size, and the language of the text.

== Uses for books ==
Aside from the primary purpose of reading them, books are also used for other ends:
* A book can be an artistic artifact; this is sometimes known as an [[artists' book]].
* A book may be evaluated by a reader or professional writer to create a [[book review]].
* A book may be read by a group of people to use as a spark for social or academic discussion, as in a [[book discussion club|book club]].
* A book may be studied by students as the subject of a writing and analysis exercise in the form of a [[book report]].
* Books are sometimes used for their exterior appearance to [[decorative arts|decorate]] a room, such as a [[study (room)|study]].

== Paper and conservation issues ==
{{main|Paper#Paper stability|Conservation-restoration}}
[[File:Halfbound book.JPG|thumb|Halfbound book with [[leather]] and [[marbled paper]].]]

Though [[paper]]making in Europe had begun around the 11th century, up until the beginning of 16th century [[vellum]] and paper were produced congruent to one another, vellum being the more expensive and durable option. Printers or publishers would often issue the same publication on both materials, to cater to more than one market.

Paper was first made in China, as early as 200 B.C., and reached Europe through [[History of Islam|Muslim]] territories. At first made of rags, the [[industrial revolution]] changed paper-making practices, allowing for paper to be made out of wood pulp.

Paper made from [[wood pulp]] became popular in the early 20th century, because it was cheaper than [[linen]] or [[abaca]] cloth-based papers. Pulp-based paper made books less expensive to the general public. This paved the way for huge leaps in the rate of literacy in industrialised nations, and enabled the spread of information during the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].

However pulp paper contained acid, that eventually destroys the paper from within. Earlier techniques for making paper used limestone rollers, which neutralized the acid in the pulp. Books printed between 1850 and 1950 are at risk; more recent books are often printed on acid-free or [[alkaline]] paper. Libraries today have to consider [[mass deacidification]] of their older collections.

Stability of the climate is critical to the long-term preservation of paper and book material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | last =Patkus | first = Beth| publication-date = 2003 | title = Assessing Preservation Needs, A Self-Survey Guide | publication-place = Andover| publisher =Northeast Document Conservation Center | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Good air circulation is important to keep fluctuation in climate stable. The [[HVAC]] system should be up to date and functioning efficiently. Light is detrimental to collections. Therefore, care should be given to the collections by implementing light control. General housekeeping issues can be addressed, including [[pest control]]. In addition to these helpful solutions, a library must also make an effort to be prepared if a disaster occurs, one that they cannot control. Time and effort should be given to create a concise and effective disaster plan to counteract any damage incurred through “acts of god” therefore a [[emergency management]] plan should be in place.

{{Hindu politics}}

'''Balasaheb Keshav Thackeray''' ({{lang-mr| बाळासाहेब केशव ठाकरे}}; pronounced {{ipa|/ʈʰakəɾe/}})  (born on 23 January 1926 in Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh, India), popularly known as ''Balasaheb'' Thackeray, is an Indian politician, founder and [[Party leader|chief]] of the [[Shiv Sena]] ([[Hindu nationalist]],[[Marathi people|Marathi]] [[ethnocentric]] and [[populism|populist]] party active mainly in the [[West India|western Indian]] state of [[Maharashtra]]). He considers himself a modern [[Hindu god]].

==Early life and career==

Bal Thackeray was born to [[Keshav Sitaram Thackeray]] (also known as ''Prabodhankar'' Thackeray in Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh because of his articles in his fortnightly magazine named Prabodhan or 'Enlightenment') in a lower-middle class, Marathi family. Keshav Thackeray was a progressive social activist and writer who was against [[Casteism|caste biases]]  and played a key role in the [[Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti|''Samyukta Maharashtra Chalwal'']] (literally, ''United Maharashtra Movement'') in the 1950s to form the [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking state of [[Maharashtra]] with [[Mumbai]] as its capital.

Bal Thackeray started his career as a [[cartoonist]] in the ''Free Press Journal'' in [[Bombay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dnaindia.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/slideshow_roar-of-the-tiger_1497754#top]&lt;/ref&gt; His cartoons were also published in the Sunday edition of ''[[The Times of India]]''. In 1960, he launched a cartoon weekly ''Marmik'' with his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnaindia.com&quot;/&gt; He used it to campaign against the growing numbers of and influence of non-Marathi people in Bombay targeting [[Gujaratis]] and South Indian labor workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnaindia.com&quot;/&gt;

He formed the [[Shiv Sena]] on 19 June 1966 with the intent of fighting for the rights of the natives of the [[States of India|state]] of Maharashtra (called Maharashtrians).&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.rediff.com/election/2004/apr/23espec3.htm Know your party: Shiv Sena - Rediff]&lt;/ref&gt; The early objective of the Shiv Sena was to ensure job security for Maharashtrians competing against immigrants from southern India, Gujaratis and Marwaris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/slideshow_roar-of-the-tiger_1497754-2#top]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the Sena's newspaper ''[[Saamna]]'' was launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/slideshow_roar-of-the-tiger_1497754-4#top]&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, the Sena was [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], and wrested control of major trade unions in Mumbai from the [[Communist Party of India]] and demanded protection money([[extortion]]) from mainly Gujarati and marwari business leaders. It later allied itself with the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) over the common issue of [[Hindu Nationalism]] which both parties believed in. The BJP-Shiv Sena combine won the 1995 [[Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha|Maharashtra State Assembly]] elections and came to power. During the tenure of the government from 1995 to 1999, Thackeray was nicknamed '[[remote control]]' since he played a major role in government policies and decisions from behind the scenes.

On July 28, 1999 Bal Thackeray was banned from voting and contesting in any election for six years from December 11, 1995 on the recommendations of the Election Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banned from voting&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/revents/01/19990199.htm#jul|title=Banned from voting|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=1999-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the six-year voting ban on Bal Thackeray was lifted in 2005, he voted for the first time in the 2006 BMC elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voting ban lifted&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2009/oct/141009-Bal-Thackeray-Uddhav-Aditya-polling-booth-Election.htm|title=Thackeray ke Bal par...|publisher=[[Mid Day]]|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thackeray has claimed that the Shiv Sena has helped the ''Marathi manoos'' (the Marathi commoner) in Mumbai and also fought for the rights of Hindu people,Thackeray is a staunch Hindu and believes that Hindus must be organised to struggle against those who oppose our identity and religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marathi Manus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2003/11/24/stories/2003112400851000.htm|title=On the wrong track|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=2006-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the public sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Public sector, Threats against other communities, businesses owned especially by Guj and Marwaris/&quot;&gt; {{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1311115,prtpage-1.cms|title=Sena fate: From roar to meow|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=2006-08-11|date=2005-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition leftist parties allege that the Shiv Sena has done little to solve the problem of unemployment facing a large proportion of Maharashtrian youth during its tenure, in contradiction to its ideological foundation of 'sons of the soil.'&lt;ref name=&quot;No deliveries&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2025/stories/20031219008601500.htm|title=Diversionary tactics|publisher=The Hindu Frontline Magazine|accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

Thackeray is very vocal in his controversial opposition to people who migrate to Mumbai, to non-[[Hindu]]s (especially [[Muslim]]s), and to illegal Muslim immigrants from [[Bangladesh]]. In the late 1960s to mid-1970s, as part of his 'Maharashtra is for Maharashtrians' campaign, Thackeray threatened migrants from [[South India]] with harm unless they left Mumbai.

In the 1960s he called South Indians ''Lungiwaale'' and ''Yanda Gandu'' and had slogans like ''Lungi Hatao Pungi bajao''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/slideshow_roar-of-the-tiger_1497754-3#top]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Thackeray issued a call to form Hindu suicide squads to counter alleged Muslim violence:
&lt;blockquote&gt; If such suicide squads are formed only then can we take on perpetrators of mindless violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thackeray for Hindu suicide squads&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/articleshow?artid=25248436|title=Thackeray for Hindu suicide squads|accessdate=2007-08-25|publisher=[[Times of India]]|date=2002-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In reaction to Thackeray’s call, Maharashtra government registered a case against him for inciting enmity between different groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=15895|title=Case filed against Thackeray for urging anti-terror suicide-squads|accessdate=2007-08-25|publisher=ExpressIndia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asia Times further reported on Thackeray’s rhetoric:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 'to take the Muslims head on'. 'Trouble-making Muslims should be wiped out from the country... kick out the four crore [40 million] Bangladeshi Muslims and then the country will be secure', the Shiv Sena leader said. Urging Hindus to start calling India 'Hindu rashtra' (Hindu nation), he maintained that only 'our religion [[Hinduism]] is to be honored here' and then 'we will look after other religions'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/DJ31Df02.html|title= India: The politics of passion|accessdate=2007-08-25|publisher=[[Asia Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At least two organizations founded and managed by the retired Indian Army officers namely Lt Col (retired) Jayant Rao Chitale and Lt Ge. P.N. Hoon (former commander-in-chief of the Western Command), answered Bal Thackeray’s call to set up the suicide squads in India. Lt Gen. Hoon claimed, Thackeray instructed him to set up the training camps through his writings and inflammatory articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.telegraphindia.com/1021115/asp/frontpage/story_1387146.asp|title= Sena land sires suicide camps|accessdate=2007-08-30|publisher=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thackeray continues to publish inflammatory editorials in his party's newsletter, ''[[Saamana]]'' (Confrontation).

On 11 November 2009, Thackeray published an editorial in Saamana which criticised a statement made by [[Sachin Tendulkar]] in an interview where he said 'Mumbai belongs to India... I am a Maharashtrian and am extremely proud of that, but I am an Indian first'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/news/india/mumbai_belongs_to_india_says_marathi_sachin.php|title=Mumbai belongs to India, says 'Marathi' Sachin|publisher=[[NDTV]]|accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by wide protests against Balasaheb Thackeray&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://beta.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article50393.ece|title=Protests against Thackeray's comments |date=November 17, 2009|accessdate=2009-11-18|location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu|first=Manas|last=Dasgupta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_thackeray-s-statement-on-sachin-a-dangerous-trend-rama-jois_1313017|title=Thackeray's statement on Sachin, a dangerous trend: Rama Jois|date=November 17, 2009|accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ptinews.com/news/379138_Political-leaders--BCCI-attack-Thackeray-for-deriding-Sachin|title=Political leaders, BCCI attack Thackeray for deriding Sachin|publisher=PTI|accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Bollywood actor [[Shah Rukh Khan]]'s film ''[[My Name Is Khan]]'' headed into controversies because of the Shiv Sena led by their chief Bal Thackeray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Despite-Sena-threat-MNIK-opens-to-packed-theatres-across-country/articleshow/5564410.cms|publisher=TOI|accessdate=2010-02-28 | title=Despite Sena threat, 'MNIK' opens to packed theatres across country|date=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/blogs/rajdeepsardesai/1/61523/an-open-letter-to-uddhav-thackeray.html|publisher=IBN|accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views on Muslims ==

Thackeray's views have typically been highly anti-Muslim. He is usually attacking them and occasionally sympathizing with them. He has declared that he is 'not against every Muslim, but only those who reside in this country but do not obey the laws of the land.... I consider such people traitors.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1090091/Bal-Thackeray Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; His party is viewed as being anti-Muslim, though Shiv Sainiks officially reject this accusation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.rediff.com/election/2004/apr/23espec3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; When explaining his views on [[Hindutva]], he has conflated Islam with violence and has called for Hindus to 'fight terrorism and fight Islam'.&lt;ref name=&quot;ibnlive&quot;&gt;[http://www.ibnlive.com/news/thackeray-rants-after-tiger-win/top/32673-4.html?xml Thackeray lashes out at Prez again],''ibnlive''&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in Suketu Mehta's book 'Maximum City', he advocates the hanging of Indian Muslims who indulge in terrorism and mass expulsion of Bangladeshi Muslim migrants from India.

In the 1980s he had stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'&quot;They [Muslims] are spreading like a cancer and should be operated on like a cancer. The... country should be saved from the Muslims and the police should support them [Hindu Maha Sangh] in their struggle just like the police in Punjab were sympathetic to the Khalistanis.'&lt;ref&gt;Bal Thackeray in ''[[India Today]]'', June 15, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Balasaheb Thackeray criticized and challenged Indian Muslims through his party newspaper, ''Sāmna'', around the time the 16th century [[Babri Mosque|Babri Masjid]] was demolished by members of the Shiv Sena and the [[Bharatiya Janta Party]] (BJP) in the northern town of [[Ayodhya]], on December 6, 1992. Hindus believe that the Babri Mosque was built on the demolished ruins of a Hindu temple in the 16th century, and consider it to be the [[Ram Janmabhoomi]] (birthplace of the Hindu God [[Rama]], an avatar of Vishnu, one of the [[Trimurti]] of the Hindu Pantheon).
The communal riots that followed the demolition of the mosque led to nearly a 1000 deaths and many enquiry committees constituted by the government have accused Shiv Sena and Thackeray of being involved in and coordinating the riots.  Thackeray however has shown no regret and feels that he is proud of what he and his partymen did back in those days because he feels that if it was not for the Shiv Sena then no one would have been able to control the Muslims after the demolition of the mosque.

However, in an interview in 1998, he claims to have tempered his stance on many issues that the Shiv Sena had with Muslims, particularly regarding the Babri Mosque or [[Ram Janmabhoomi]] issue,&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 interview&quot;&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jan/21nandy.htm The Rediff Election Interview/Bal Thackeray],''Rediff.com''&lt;/ref&gt; saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'We must look after the Muslims and treat them as part of us.'&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 interview&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He has since made more inflammatory statements regarding Muslims, and reiterated his desire for Hindus to unite across linguistic barriers and to see 'a Hindustan for Hindus' and to 'bring Islam in this country down to its knees'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expressindia.com/election/fullestory.php?type=ei&amp;content_id=80435
Hindustan of Hindus my dream: Thackeray, expressindia.com&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he has also expressed admiration for Muslims in Mumbai in the wake of the [[11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings]] perpetrated by [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalists]]. In response to threats made by the leader of the [[Samajwadi Party]] that accusations of terrorism directed at Indian Muslims would bring about communal strife, Thackeray said that the unity of Mumbaikars (residents of Mumbai) in the wake of the terrorist attacks was  'a slap to fanatics of Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi' and that Thackeray 'salute(s) those Muslims who participated in the two minutes' silence on July 18 to mourn the blast victims'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1783408.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Mumbai's unity a slap to fanatics: Thackeray | date=2006-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Thackeray wrote 'Islamic terrorism is growing and Hindu terrorism is the only way to counter it. We need suicide bomb squads to protect India and Hindus'.&lt;ref&gt;[ibnpolitics|http://ibnlive.in.com/news/politicians-indulge-in-hate-speech-with-impunity/89623-37-64.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views on people from Uttar Pradesh &amp; Bihar ==
{{Main|2008 attacks on North Indians in Maharashtra}}

On March 6, 2008, Bal Thackeray issued an editorial titled ''Ek Bihari, Sau Bimari''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Now, it’s Bal Thackeray’s turn to rail against Biharis|author=Ganesh Kanate|coauthor=Shubhangi Khapre|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1154619|publisher=''[[Daily News &amp; Analysis]]''|accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (One Bihari, Hundred maladies)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bihartimes.com/newsbihar/2008/march/newsbihar05march6.html|publisher=''Bihar Times''|accessdate=2008-06-06|title=Biharis are an affliction, says Bal Thackeray|date=2008-03-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080510232211/http://bihartimes.com/newsbihar/2008/march/newsbihar05march6.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Saamna'', Shiv Sena's political mouthpiece, saying Biharis were 'an unwanted lot' in the Maharashtra. In what was termed as an apparent bid to recapture his party's Marathi sons of soil plank, which was being hijacked by the MNS leader Raj Thackeray, Bal Thackeray wrote about Biharis,&lt;ref name=&quot;TOI_unwanted&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Biharis an unwanted lot: Bal Thackeray|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2839844.cms|accessdate=2008-04-04|publisher=''[[The Times of India]]''|date=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'They [Biharis] are not wanted in southern India, Assam and also Punjab and Chandigarh. The Biharis have antagonised local population wherever they had settled. The UP-Bihari MPs have shown their ingratitude towards Mumbai and Maharashtra with an anti-Marathi tirade in Parliament.'&lt;ref name=&quot;TOI_unwanted&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He also denounced Bihari MPs, saying they were 'spitting in the same plate from which they ate' by criticising Mumbaikars and Maharashtrians. He also wrote, 'They are trying to add fuel to the fire that has been extinguished, by saying that Mumbaikars have rotten brains'. Additionally, he criticized a major holiday celebrated by people from Bihar, and  eastern UP which happens six days after the Hindu New Year (Diwali) known as Chath Pooja. He said that it wasn't a real holiday.&lt;ref name=&quot;IE_rattled&quot; /&gt; The outburst was apparently in response to MPs from Bihar who had disrupted the proceedings of the [[Lok Sabha]] in protest against the attacks on North Indians.&lt;ref name=&quot;IE_rattled&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/story/281062.html|title= Rattled by Raj, Thackeray abuses Biharis news|publisher=''[[The Indian Express]]''|accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bihar chief minister, [[Nitish Kumar]], upset with the remarks, demanded that the Prime Minister and the Centre intervene in the matter immediately. The ''Saamna'' editorial prompted at least 16 Lok Sabha MPs from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, belonging to the RJD, JD (U), SP and the Congress, to give notice for [[breach of privilege]] proceedings against Bal Thackeray.&lt;ref name=&quot;IE_rattled&quot; /&gt; After the matter was raised in the Lok Sabha [[Speaker of Lok Sabha|Speaker]] [[Somnath Chatterjee]] said: 'If anybody has made any comment on our members’ functioning in the conduct of business in the House, not only do we treat that with the contempt that it deserves, but also any action that may be necessary will be taken according to procedure and well established norms. Nobody will be spared.'&lt;ref name=&quot;IE_rattled&quot; /&gt;

On March 27, 2008 in protest against Balasaheb Thackeray's editorial, leaders of Shiv Sena in [[Delhi]] resigned citing its 'outrageous conduct' towards non-Marathis in Maharashtra and announced that they will form a separate party.&lt;ref name=&quot;TOI_quit&quot; /&gt; Addressing a press conference Shiv Sena's North India chief [[Jai Bhagwan Goyal]] said the decision to leave the party was taken because of the 'partial attitude' of the party high command towards Maharashtrians. 'Shiv Sena is no different from Khalistan and Jammu and Kashmir militant groups which are trying to create a rift between people along regional lines. The main aim of these forces is to split our country. Like the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, the Shiv Sena too has demeaned North Indians and treated them inhumanely', he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;TOI_quit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//Shav_Senas_North_Indian_leaders_quit/articleshow/2902796.cms? |publisher=''[[The Times of India]]''|accessdate=2008-04-04|title=Shiv Sena’s North Indian leaders quit|date=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/03/28/stories/2008032851310300.htm|accessdate=2008-04-04|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''|title=Delhi Shiv Sena chief resigns|location=Chennai, India|date=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views against former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam ==

Thackeray has been a vocal critic of the former [[President of India]], Dr. [[Abdul Kalam]]. Thackeray said Kalam was a leading scientist of the country but had 'lost the dignity of the post' after he became President. He has criticized Kalam's indecisiveness regarding the conviction of  [[Mohammad Afzal]], who has been sentenced to death following his conviction for the [[2001 Indian Parliament attack]]. Thackeray criticizes the fact that a convicted terrorist's appeal for clemency is even being considered by Kalam.&lt;ref name=&quot;ibnlive&quot;/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Afzal was sentenced to death by the highest court in this country in October and yet the file has been sitting on the President's table for the past four months. I have not said anything wrong about Kalam. We all have supported him to become President. Afzal's clemency letter is still lying with the President. Give me another example where the President has not taken decision on a clemency petition for four months.'&lt;ref name=&quot;ibnlive&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His views on Kalam have been heavily criticized by Parliamentary Affairs Minister [[Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi]] as inappropriate and 'violative of decorum'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1559142.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Dasmunsi flays Thackeray's comments on Kalam | date=2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admiration of Hitler==

Thackeray &lt;ref&gt;P. 90 India and the International System
 By Sisir Gupta, Mannaraswamighala Sreeranga Rajan, Shivaji Ganguly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. 201 Jawaharlal Nehru on Communalism
 By Nand Lal Gupta&lt;/ref&gt; has attracted controversy for his praise of [[Adolf Hitler]].

Apparently he was quoted by ''[[Asiaweek]]'' as saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;'I am a great admirer of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], and I am not ashamed to say so! I do not say that I agree with all the methods he employed, but he was a wonderful organizer and orator, and I feel that he and I have several things in common.... What India really needs is a [[dictator]] who will rule benevolently, but with an iron hand.' [http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/95/0922/nat5.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt; In an interview with the ''[[Indian Express]]'' that was printed on January 29, 2007, Thackeray remarked, &lt;blockquote&gt;Hitler did very cruel and ugly things. But he was an artist, I love him (for that). He had the power to carry the whole nation, the mob with him. You have to think what magic he had. He was a miracle.... The killing of Jews was wrong. But the good part about Hitler was that he was an artist. He was a daredevil. He had good qualities and bad. I may also have good qualities and bad ones. [http://www.indianexpress.com/story/21977-3.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt; However, in the ''Star Talk'' talk show on channel Star Plus, he claimed himself not to admire Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Talk'' 08/09/11/&lt;/ref&gt;

Thackeray's supporters, such as columnist [[Varsha Bhosle]], have defended Thackeray's position as necessary in what they claim is an atmosphere of religious extremism against Hindus. In defense of a statement by Thackeray that 'If the Muslims of India behave as the Jews in Germany did, they will deserve the same treatment', Bhosle writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Germany's Jews...? What else is required for Hindus to shake off the stupor and consider protecting our civilisation and culture? If telling it like it is makes one a [[Nazi]], I say: Fine, better that than the spineless, deaf, dumb, numb and blind state exalted as Nehruvian Secularism. I wouldn't even spit on it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jan/29varsha.htm In rod we trust], Varsha Bhosle&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an article appearing in Newindpress.com on August 20, 2007, Thackeray is quoted as wanting to be a dictator and the Hitler of the whole of India:
&lt;blockquote&gt; He is on record as having told the Navakal: 'Yes, I am a dictator. It is a Hitler that is needed in India today'. He was once asked in a television programme whether he wanted to be the Hitler of Mumbai. &quot;Do not underestimate me,&quot; he is reported to have retorted. 'I am (the Hitler) of the whole of Maharashtra and want to be of whole of India.' The Hitler question was put to him in September 1996 by Outlook magazine as well during an interview. 'Once you’d expressed admiration for certain facets of Hitler.' 'Comparison was inevitable', the interviewer prompted. Thackaray said: 'I have not sent anybody to the gas chamber. If I’d been like that, you wouldn't have dared to come and interview me.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEM20070819224536&amp;Title=Main+Article&amp;rLink=0|title=Where Hitler meets Thackeray|accessdate=2007-08-24|publisher=[[Newindpress.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Pro-Tamil Tiger views==

Thackeray has admitted that he is pro-[[Tamil Tiger]]. He says, &quot;I am proud of the Tigers for the gallant manner in which they are fighting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiarightsonline.com/Sabrang/relipolcom5.nsf/5e7647d942f529c9e5256c3100376e2e/9b470d43e7593f0465256ccc0048aa8f/$FILE/bac04414.pdf &quot;Thackeray: I am proud of LTTE&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wanted a ban on the LTTE lifted by the center-wing government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/may/10thack.htm &quot;Thackeray backs &amp;#91;LTTE&amp;#93;, wants ban lifted&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rift in party==

An increase in intra-party rivalry between Balasaheb Thackeray's son [[Uddhav Thackeray]], and nephew [[Raj Thackeray]] led to divisions within the Shiv Sena. In addition to this, several old hands such as hard-line leader [[Narayan Rane]] and [[Sanjay Nirupam]] were expelled or left the Sena.

On November 27, 2005, Raj Thackeray announced his resignation as a primary member of the Shiv Sena. On March 9, 2006, Raj announced the formation of the [[Maharashtra Navnirman Sena]] (MNS).

On November 28, 2009, in another jolt to Shiv Sena, [[Smita Thackeray]], daughter in law of Bal Thackeray announced to quit Shiv Sena and join Congress party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Thackeray-bahu-Smita-set-to-join-Congress/articleshow/5277262.cms &quot;Thackeray bahu Smita set to join Congress&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valentine's Day protests==

Boycotting shops and restaurants that allow young people to celebrate the Western holiday of  [[Valentine's Day]], interpreted as bestial, indecent and a-Bharatiya (un-Indian) by Thackeray, is one of his recent actions. These boycotts have often culminated in violence and the destruction of those shops.

On February 14, 2006, Balasaheb Thackeray condemned and apologized for the violent attacks of Shiv Sena members upon a private Valentine's Day celebration in Mumbai. 'It is said that women were beaten up in the Nallasopara incident. If that really happened, then it is a symbol of cowardice', Thackeray said, 'I have always instructed Shiv Sainiks that in any situation women should not be humiliated and harassed.'[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1419743.cms] Thackeray and the Shiv Sena remain opposed to Valentine's Day celebrations, although they may support an 'Indian alternative'.[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1413273.cms]
However, in some cases, the Sena has been more tolerant during Valentine's Day celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;http://punekar.in/site/2009/02/11/no-protest-from-shiv-sena-this-valentines-day/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats for the Final match of ICC World Cup Cricket Tournament==

Just before the &quot;ICC World Cup Cricket Tournament&quot; begins, Manohar Joshi, a senior leader of Shiv Sena, announced that, if the Pakistan team reaches the final (scheduled in Mumbai), Bal Thackeray will decide whether to allow them to play or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1464606.ece |title=Sena leader announces veiled threat on World Cup final involving Pakistan |publisher=The Hindu |date= 2011-02-17|accessdate=2011-02-17 |location=Mumbai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==

Thackery is satirized in [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[The Moor's Last Sigh]]'' as 'Raman Fielding'. [[Suketu Mehta]] interviews Thackeray in his critically acclaimed, [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer-nominated]], non-fiction 2004 book ''[[Maximum City]]''.

{{pp-semi|small=yes}}{{pp-move-indef}}
{{Wiktionary|B|b}}
{{Latin alphabet navbox|uc=B|lc=b}}
'''B''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|b|iː}}; [[English_alphabet#Letter_names|named]] ''bee'')&lt;ref&gt;&quot;B&quot; ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' 2nd edition (1989); ''Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged'' (1993); &quot;bee&quot;, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;  is the second [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] in the [[basic modern Latin alphabet]]. It is used to represent a variety of [[bilabial consonant|bilabial sounds]] (depending on language), most commonly a [[voiced bilabial plosive]].

==History==
‹B› started as a [[pictogram]] of the floorplan of a house in [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s or the [[Proto-Sinaitic alphabet]]. By [[1050 BC]], the [[Phoenician alphabet]]'s letter had a linear form that served as the beth.

==Typography==
The modern lowercase ‹b› derives from later [[Roman cursive#New Roman cursive|Roman]] times, when scribes began omitting the upper loop of the capital.

‹B› is often confused with the visually similar [[German language|German]] ‹[[ß]]› which stands for ‹ss› (historically, &lt;ſz&gt;).

==Usage==

In [[English language|English]] and most other languages that use the Latin alphabet, ‹b› denotes the [[voiced bilabial plosive]] {{IPAc-en|b}}, as in ''bib''. In English it is sometimes silent; most instances are derived from old monosyllablic words with the b final and immediately preceded by an ''m'', such as ''lamb'' and ''bomb''; a few are examples of [[etymology|etymological]] spelling to make the word more like its [[Latin language|Latin]] original, such as ''debt'' or ''doubt''.  In [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], ‹b› does not denote a voiced consonant; instead, it represents a voiceless {{IPA|/p/}} that contrasts with either a [[geminate]]d {{IPA|/pp/}} (in Estonian) or an [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]] {{IPA|/pʰ/}} (in Chinese, Danish and Icelandic), represented by ‹p›. In [[Fijian language|Fijian]] ‹b› represents a [[prenasalized consonant|prenasalized]] {{IPA|/mb/}}, whereas in [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] it represents an [[implosive consonant|implosive]] {{IPA|/ɓ/}}, in contrast to the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ‹bh› which represents {{IPA|/b/}}.

[[Finnish language|Finnish]] only uses ‹b› in loanwords.

In the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]] and [[X-SAMPA]], {{IPA|‹b›}} denotes the [[voiced bilabial plosive]]. Variants of ‹b› denote related [[bilabial consonant]]s, like the [[voiced bilabial implosive]] and the [[bilabial trill]]. In [[X-SAMPA]], capital ‹B› denotes the [[voiced bilabial fricative]].

‹B› is also a [[musical note]]. Its value varies depending on the region; a ‹b› in Anglophone countries represents a note that is a semitone higher than the B note in Northern Continental Europe. (Anglophone B is represented in Northern Europe with ‹H›.) Archaic forms of ‹b›, the ''b quadratum'' (square b, {{music|natural}}) and ''b rotundum'' (round b, {{music|b}}) remain in use for musical notation as the symbols for ''[[natural (music)|natural]]'' and ''[[flat (music)|flat]]'', respectively.

In Contracted (grade 2) English braille, ‹b› stands for &quot;but&quot; when in isolation.

==Computing codes==
{{Letter
|NATO=Bravo
|Morse=–···
|Character=B2
|Braille=⠃
}}
In [[Unicode]] the [[majuscule|capital]] ‹B› is codepoint U+0042 and the [[lower case]] ‹b› is U+0062.

The [[ASCII]] code for capital ‹B› is 66 and for lower case ‹b› is 98; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 01000010 and 01100010, respectively.

The [[EBCDIC]] code for capital ‹B› is 194 and for lowercase ‹b› is 130; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 11000010 and 10000010, respectively.

The [[numeric character reference]]s in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] are &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#66;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#98;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for upper and lower case, respectively.

The ъ serves as an orthographic device that indicates that the consonant preceding the ъ is not palatalized.
*Ь, ь, also known as the [[soft sign]], [[soft sign|front yer]], or [[soft sign|myagkiy znak]], is also shaped like the letter b, but has no phonetic value on its own in modern [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] languages. The ь serves as orthographic device that indicates that the consonant preceding the ь is softened or palatalized.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{other uses|Body (disambiguation)}}

With regard to [[organism|living things]], a '''body''' is the [[physical body]] of an individual. &quot;Body&quot; often is used in connection with [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], [[health]] issues and [[death]]. The study of the workings of the body is [[physiology]].

==Human body==
{{Main|Human body}}
The human body mostly consists of a [[head (anatomy)|head]], [[neck]], [[torso]], two [[arm]]s and two [[Human leg|legs]], as well as numerous internal organ groups such as respiratory, circulatory and a central nervous system.

==Variations==
{{redirect|Carcase||Carcass (disambiguation)}}
The dead body of a [[human]] is referred to as a [[cadaver]], or corpse. The dead bodies of [[vertebrate]] animals, [[insect]]s and humans are somet imes called [[Carrion|''carcasses'']]. The study of the structure of the body is called [[human anatomy|anatomy]]. A ''carcase'' is the body of a slaughtered animal, after the removal of offal, that is to be used as [[meat]].&lt;ref&gt;Delbridge, Arthur, The Macquarie Dictionary, 2nd ed., Macquarie Library, North Ryde, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antonym==
In the views emerging from the [[mind-body dichotomy]], the body is considered in [[behavior]] and therefore considered as little valued&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;&gt;''[http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html The mind-body problem]'' by Robert M. Young&lt;/ref&gt; and trivial in comparison to mind, [[spirit]] or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. [[Materialism|Materialist]] philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body, but is produced by physiological functions of the [[Human brain|brain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first=J.|editor=Honderich, Ted|others=|title=Problems in the Philosophy of Mind.

'''Bitola''' ({{lang-mk|Битола}} {{IPA-mk|ˈbitɔɫa||Mk-Bitola.ogg}}, formerly &lt;!--standard English names until 1950's--&gt;'''Monastir''' or '''Manastır'''; known also by several [[#Etymology|alternative names]]) is a city in the southwestern part of the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. The city is an administrative, cultural, industrial, commercial, and educational centre. It is located in the southern part of the [[Pelagonia]] valley, surrounded by the [[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|Baba]] and [[Nidže]] mountains, 15km north of the [[Medžitlija-Níki]] border crossing with [[Greece]]. It is an important junction connecting the south of the [[Adriatic Sea]] with the [[Aegean Sea]] and [[Central Europe]]. It has been known since the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period as &quot;the city of the consuls&quot;, since many European countries have consulates in Bitola. According to some sources, Bitola is the [[List of cities in the Republic of Macedonia by population|second largest town]] in the country,&lt;ref name=&quot;Omri&quot;&gt;The Omri Annual Survey (1996): Forging ahead, falling behind, page 137&lt;/ref&gt; and to others the third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&amp;men=gcis&amp;lng=en&amp;des=gamelan&amp;dat=200&amp;srt=pnan&amp;col=aohdqcfbeimg&amp;geo=-139 World Gazetteer: Macedonia - largest cities (per geographical entity)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bitola is also the seat of the [[Bitola Municipality]].

==Etymology==
According to Adrian Room, the name ''Bitola'' is derived from the [[Old Church Slavonic|old Slavic]] word ''Obitel'' (monastery or abode), since the city was formerly noted for its monastery. When the meaning of the name was no longer understood, it lost its prefix &quot;o&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Room | first = Adrian | title = Placenames of the world: origins and meanings of the names for 6,600 countries, cities, territories, natural features, and historic sites | place = Jefferson, N.C. | publisher = McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. | year = 2006 | edition = 2nd | page = 60 | isbn = 0786422483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Bitola'' is mentioned in the [[Bitola inscription]], related to the old city fortress built in 1015. Modern Slavic variants include the [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] ''Bitola'' (Битола), the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''Bitolj'' (Битољ) and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''Bitolya'' (Битоля). In [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, the name was hellenized to ''Voutélion'' (Βουτέλιον) or ''Vitólia'' (Βιτώλια), hence the names ''Butella'' by [[William of Tyre]], ''Butili'' by the Arab geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|al-Idrisi]]. The [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] name ''Bituli'' is also derived from the Slavic name.

Another [[Greek language|Greek]] name under which the city used to be best-known and which is still in use, is ''Monastíri'' (Μοναστήρι), also meaning &quot;monastery&quot;. The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name ''Manastır'' ({{lang-ota|مناستر}}) is derived from the Greek name, as is the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] ''Manastiri''.

[[Image:Catolic church bitola.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Catholic Church &quot;Holy Heart of Jesus&quot;, on the main street of Bitola.]]

The city expanded along the banks of the Dragor River at an altitude of  615 m  above sea level at the foot of [[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|Baba Mountain]]. Covering an area of 1,798&amp;nbsp;km². and with a population of 122,173 (1991), Bitola is an important industrial, agricultural, commercial, educational, and cultural center. It represents an important junction that connects the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the south with the [[Aegean Sea]] and [[Central Europe]]. Bitola has one of the oldest and most prestigious theaters in the country.
[[Image:BitolaCity.jpg|thumb|left|Architecture in Bitola]]
Traditionally a strong trading center, Bitola is also known as the city of the consuls. At one time during the Ottoman rule, Bitola had consulates from twelve countries. During the same period, there were a number of prestigious schools in the city, including a military academy that, among others, was attended by the famous Turkish reformer [[Kemal Atatürk]]. Bitola was also the headquarters of many cultural organizations that were established at that time.

The Baba Mountain overlooks Bitola from the east. Its magnificent [[Pelister]] mountain (2601 m) is a national park with exquisite flora and fauna, among which the rarest species of pine, known as [[Macedonian pine]] or [[pinus peuce]], as well as a well-known ski resort.

==Geography==
Bitola is located in the southwestern part of Macedonia. The [[Dragor River]] flows through the city. Bitola is located at an elevation of 615 meters above sea level.

==History==
===Prehistory===

The Bitola area is very rich in monuments from the prehistoric period. Two important ones are [[Veluška Tumba]], and [[Bara Tumba]] near the village of Porodin. From the [[Copper Age]] there are the settlements of Tumba near the village of Crnobuki, Shuplevec near the village of Suvodol, and Visok Rid near the village of Bukri. The [[Bronze Age]] is represented by the settlements of Tumba near the village of Kanino and the settlement with the same name near the village of Karamani.

===Ancient and early Byzantine periods===
There are important metal artifacts from the ancient period at the necropolis of Crkvishte near the village of Beranci. A golden earring dating from the 4th century BC is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the Macedonian 10 [[Macedonian denar|denars]] banknote, issued in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbrm.gov.mk National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia]. Macedonian currency. Banknotes in circulation: [http://www.nbrm.gov.mk/default-en.asp?ItemID=A82826138490824E874DC0F6B8BCE3DE 10 Denars]. – Retrieved on 30 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heraclea Lyncestis]] ({{lang-el|Ηράκλεια Λυγκηστίς}}&lt;ref&gt;[[NGL Hammond|Hammond, N. G. L.]], (1972), ''A History of Macedonia'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt; - ''City of Hercules upon the Land of the Lynx'') was an important settlement from the [[Hellenistic period]] till the early [[Middle Ages]]. It was founded by [[Philip II of Macedon]] by the middle of the 4th century BC, and named after the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[demigod]] [[Heracles]], whom Philip considered his ancestor. With its strategic location, it became a prosperous city. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered this part of [[Macedon]] in 148 BC and destroyed the political power of the city. However, its prosperity continued mainly due to the Roman [[Via Egnatia]] road which passed near the city. Several monuments from the Roman times remain in Heraclea, including a [[portico]], [[thermae]] (baths), an [[amphitheater]] and a number of [[basilica]]s. The theatre was once capable of housing an audience of around 3,000 people.

In the early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period (4th to 6th centuries AD) Heraclea was an important episcopal centre. Some of its bishops were mentioned in the acts of the Church Councils, including Bishop Evagrius of Heraclea in the Acts of the [[Archbishopric of Sardica#Council of Sardica|Sardica Council]] of 343 AD. A small and a great (Large) basilica, the bishop's residence, and a funeral basilica near the necropolis are some of the remains of this period. Three [[nave]]s in the Great Basilica are covered with [[mosaic]]s of very rich floral and figurative [[iconography]]; these well preserved mosaics are often regarded as fine examples of the early [[Christian art]] period. During the 4th and 6th centuries, the names of other bishops from Heraclea were recorded. The city was sacked by [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] forces, commanded by [[Theodoric the Great]] in 472 and, despite a large gift to him from the city's bishop, it was sacked again in 479.

It was restored in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. In the late 6th century the city suffered successive attacks by [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes and was gradually abandoned.

===Arrival of the Slavs===
In the 6th and 7th centuries, the region around Bitola experienced a demographic shift as more and more Slavic tribes settled in the area. In place of the deserted theater, several houses were built during that time. The Slavs also built a fortress around their settlement. Bitola became a part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] from late 8th to early 11th centuries. The spread of Christianity was assisted by St. [[Clement of Ohrid]] and [[Naum of Preslav]] in the 9th and early 10th centuries. Many monasteries and churches were built in the city.

In the 10th century, Bitola was under the rule of tsar Samuil. He built a castle in the town, later used by his successor [[Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria]]. The town is mentioned in several medieval sources. [[John Skylitzes]]'s 11th century chronicle mentions that Emperor [[Basil II]] burned Gavril's castles in Bitola, when passing through and ravaging Pelagonia. The second [[chrysobull]] (1019) of Basil II mentioned that the Bishop of Bitola depended on the [[Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. During the reign of Samuil, the city was an important centre in the Bulgarian state and the seat of the Bitola Bishopric. In many medieval sources, especially Western, the name Pelagonia was synonymous with the Bitola Bishopric, and in some of them Bitola was known under the name of Heraclea due to the church tradition that turned the Heraclea Bishopric into the Pelagonian Metropolitan's Diocese. In 1015, tsar Gavril Radomir was killed by his cousin [[Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria|Ivan Vladislav]], who declared himself tsar and rebuilt the city fortress. To celebrate the occasion, a [[Bitola inscription|stone inscription]] written in the [[Cyrillic]] alphabet was set in the fortress; in it the Slavic name of the city is mentioned: Bitol.

Following battles with tsar Ivan Vladislav, Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] recaptured Monastiri in 1015. The town is mentioned as an episcopal centre in 1019 in a record by Basil II. Two important uprisings against Byzantine rule took place in the Bitola area in 1040 and 1072. After the Bulgarian state was restored in late 11th century, Bitola was incorporated under the rule of tsar [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]]. It was conquered again by Byzantium at the end of the 13th century, but it became part of [[Serbia]] in the first half of the 14th century, after the conquests of [[Stefan Dušan]].

As a military, political and cultural center, Bitola played a very important role in the life of the medieval society in the region, prior to the Ottoman conquest in the mid-14th century. On the eve of the Ottoman conquest, Bitola (Monastir in Ottoman Turkish) experienced great growth with its well-established trading links all over the Balkan Peninsula, especially with big economic centers like [[Constantinople]], [[Thessalonica]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] and [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]. Caravans of various goods moved to and from Bitola.

===Ottoman rule===
[[Image:Bitola old.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Bitola in the 19th century]]
From 1382 to 1912, Manastır (now Bitola) was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Fierce battles took place near the city during the arrival of Turkish forces. Turkish rule was completely established after the death of [[Prince Marko]] in 1395. For several centuries, Turks were a majority in this city, while the villages were populated mostly with  Slavs. [[Evliya Çelebi]] says in his ''[[Seyahatname|Book of Travels]]'' that the city had 70 mosques, several coffee-tea rooms, a [[bazaar]] (market) with iron gates and 900 shops. Manastır became a [[sanjak]] centre in the [[Rumelia|Rumeli]] [[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|eyalet]] (Ottoman province).

After the [[Austro-Ottoman War (disambiguation)|Austro-Ottoman war]]s, the trade development and the overall thriving of the city was stifled. But in late 19th century, it again it became the second-biggest city in the wider southern Balkan region after [[Salonica]]. The city is also known as &quot;city of consuls&quot;, because 12 diplomatic consuls resided here from 1878 to 1913.

In 1864, Manastır became the center of [[Monastir eyalet]] which included the sanjaks of [[Debar|Debre]], [[Servia, Greece|Serfiçe]], [[Elbasan]], Manastır (Bitola), [[Koritsa|Görice]] and towns of [[Kicevo|Kırcaova]], [[Prilep|Pirlepe]], [[Florina]], [[Kastoria|Kesriye]] and [[Grevena]].

[[File:Амамот во Битола, сега стоковна куќа.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Turkish bath]]

There is opposing ethnographic data from that period, but it appears that no specific ethnic or religious group could claim an absolute majority of the population. According to the [http://www.univ.trieste.it/~storia/corsi/Dogo/tabelle/popolaz-ottomana1911.jpg 1911 Ottoman census], [[Greeks]] were the largest Christian population in the vilayet, with 740,000 Greeks, 517,000 Bulgarians and 1,061,000 Muslims in the vilayets of Selanik (Thessaloniki) and Manastır. However, it should be noted that the basis of the Ottoman censuses was the millet system. People were assigned an ethnicity according to their religion. So all Sunni Muslims were categorised as Turks and all members of the Greek Orthodox church as Greeks, although their numbers included a vast majority of [[Aromanians]] and some Macedonian Slavs. The rest were divided between Bulgarian and Serb Orthodox churches.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ortayli 2006 89-8&quot;&gt;Ortaylı, İlber. ''&quot;Son İmparatorluk Osmanlı (The Last Empire: Ottoman Empire)&quot;'', İstanbul, Timaş Yayınları (Timaş Press), 2006. pp. 87–89. ISBN 975-263-490-7 {{tr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Also see &quot;Jewish community&quot; below.) But the Ottoman register of Bedel-I Askeriye Tax of 1873 says the Manastır vilayet had about 150,000 Bulgarian men (heads of households), 40,000 Muslim and only 700 Greek. Ottoman population data from 1901 counts 566,000 Slavs, 363,000 Turks and 260,000 Greeks in the [[Thessaloniki]] and Manastır vilayets.[http://wallaby.vu.edu.au/adt-VVUT/uploads/approved/adt-VVUT20060426.160820/public/03ch2.pdf].

In 1894, Manastır was connected with [[Salonika|Selanik]] by train. The first motion picture made in the Balkans was recorded by the [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] [[Manakis brothers]] in Manastır in 1903. In their honour, the annual Manaki Brothers International Film Camera Festival is held in modern Bitola. The [[Manastır congress]] of 1908 which defined the modern [[Albanian alphabet]] was held in the city.

===Ilinden Uprising===
[[File:Bitola.1914.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Street in Bitola in 1914]]

The Bitola region was a stronghold of the [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising|Ilinden Uprising]]. The uprising was started as decided in 1903 in Thessaloniki by the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO). [[Gotse Delchev]] opposed the timing of the uprising, saying that the people were not ready. He was killed on 4 May 1903 near [[Banitsa (ruins)|Banitza]] village (today in [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greece]]).   The uprising in the Bitola region was planned in [[Smilevo]] village in May 1903. The battles were fought in the villages of Bistrica, Rakovo, Buf, Skocivir, Paralovo, Brod, Novaci, Smilevo, Gjavato, Capari and others. Smilevo was defended by 600 rebels led by [[Dame Gruev]] and [[Georgi Sugarev]], but when they were defeated, villages were burned.

===Balkan wars===
In 1912, [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Greece]] fought the Ottomans in the [[First Balkan War]]. According to the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1913]], the region of Macedonia was divided in 3 parts among Greeks, Serbs and Bulgarians. Bitola was to be in Bulgaria, according to a pre-war alliance agreement between Bulgaria and Serbia. But the Serbian army entered the city and refused to hand it to Bulgaria. From that moment, the city started to lose its importance and the population started rapidly decreasing, emigrating outside Macedonia and to the [[New World]].

===World War I===
[[File:Vivat-bander - 1915-12-04 - Monastir by O. R. Bossert.jpg|thumb|80px|left|German [[Vivat ribbons|Vivat ribbon]] commemorating the taking of Monastir by Bulgarian forces in 1915]]

During [[World War I]] Bitola was on the Thessaloniki front line. In 1915 Bulgarian forces took the city and the Serb forces were forced to either surrender or try a dangerous escape through the Albanian mountains. In 1916, Bitola was occupied by the [[Allied Powers]] which entered the city from the South fighting the Bulgarian army. Bitola was divided into French, Russian, Italian and Serbian regions, under the command of French general [[Maurice Sarrail]]. Until Bulgaria's surrender in late autumn 1918, Bitola remained a front line city and was almost every day bombarded by airplanes and battery and suffered almost total destruction.

===Between the two world wars===
[[Image:Partizani Bitola.JPG|thumb|260px|right|Macedonian partisans liberating the city of Bitola.]]
After the end of World War I (1918) Bitola was included in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later called the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The city became a neglected border town, just 14 kilometres from [[Greece]]. Bitola's decline continued throughout this period, together with the general decline in Vardarska Banovina (Vardar Banovina), which remained one of the poorest regions in Yugoslavia.

===World War II===
During the [[World War II]] (1941–1945), the Germans and later Bulgarians took control of the city. But in September 1944, Bulgaria switched sides in the war and withdrew from Yugoslavia, and Bitola was freed by Macedonian pro-[[Titoism|Tito]]ist Partisans. On 4 November, the 7th Macedonian Liberation Brigade entered Bitola victoriously. After the end of the war, a Macedonian state was established for the first time in modern history, within Yugoslavia. This had cost about 25,000 human lives. In 1945, the first Gymnasium (named &quot;[[Josip Broz Tito]]&quot;) to use the Macedonian language, was opened in Bitola.

===Jewish community===
{{See also|History of the Jews in the Republic of Macedonia|History of the Jews in Monastir}}

After the [[Alhambra decree|Expulsion of 1492]], [[Sephardi Jews|Spanish-speaking Jews]] harassed and persecuted by the [[Inquisition]], accepted by [[Sultan Bayezid II]] to the Ottoman territories and arrived in waves from the Iberian peninsula ([[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]). A majority settled in [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]], but a large community grew in Monastir and made up over ten percent of the city's population in 1900. The local Jewish population referred to themselves as ''[[Monastirli]]'', and a Monastirli synagogue exists to this day in modern [[Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cassorla.net/Families.html Families of Monastir]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was little evidence of anti-Semitism among other local communities. The Jews and the [[Aromanians]] were the only communities who did not make a national claim on Macedonian territory and were generally seen as neutral in these disputes.

Most Jews of Monastir were murdered during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], and at present none remain in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sephardicstudies.org/monastir1839-1943.html &quot;Last Century of a Sephardic Community, The Jews of Monastir, 1839-1943&quot;, by Mark Cohen]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sights==
The city has many historical building dating from many historical periods. The most notable ones are from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman age]], but there are some from the more recent past.

===Clock Tower===
[[Image:saat.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The clock tower in Bitola.]]
It is unknown when Bitola's [[clock tower]] was built. Written sources from the 16th century mention a clock tower, but it is not clear if it is the same one. Some believe it was built at the same time as St. Dimitrija Church, in 1830. Legend says that the Ottoman authorities collected around 60,000 eggs from nearby villages and mixed them in the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] to make the walls stronger.
[[File:Magnolija bitola.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Russian consulate and the Austrian library in the center of Bitola, with the clock tower in the background.]]
The tower has a rectangular base and is about 30 meters high. Near the top is a rectangular terrace with an iron fence. On each side of the fence is an iron console construction which holds the lamps for lighting the clock. The clock is on the highest of three levels. The original clock was replaced during World War II with a working one, given by the Nazis because the city had maintained German graves from World War I.
[[File:Slavic University of Moscow in Bitola.JPG|The headquarters of the Slavic Institute of Moscow in Bitola|thumb|right|200px]]
The massive tower is composed of walls, massive spiral stairs, wooden mezzanine constructions, pendentives (triangular pass from square to cupola) and cupola. During the construction of the tower, the facade was simultaneously decorated with simple stone plastic.
[[File:Museum and fountain Bitola.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The museum of Bitola, with a fountain in the foreground, next to an old block]]

===St. Dimitrija Church===
The St. Dimitrija Church was built in 1830 with voluntary contributions of local merchants and craftsmen. It is plain on the outside, as all churches in the [[Ottoman Empire]] had to be, but of rare beauty inside, lavishly decorated with [[chandelier]]s, a carved bishop throne and an engraved [[iconostasis]]. According to some theories, the iconostasis is a work of the [[Miyak]] engravers. Its most impressive feature is the arc above the imperial quarters with modeled figures of [[Jesus]] and the apostles.

Other engraved wood items include the bishop's throne made in the spirit of Miyak engravers, several [[icon frames]] and five more-recent pillars shaped like thrones. The frescos originate from two periods: the end of the 19th century, and the end of [[World War I]] to the present. The icons and frescos were created thanks to voluntary contributions of local businessmen and citizens. The authors of many of the icons had a vast knowledge of iconography schemes of the [[New Testament]]. The icons show a great sense of color, dominated by red, green and ochra shades. The abundance of golden ornaments is noticeable and points to the presence of [[late-Byzantine]] artwork and [[baroque style]]. The icon of St. Dimitrij is signed with the initials &quot;D. A. Z.&quot;, showing that it was made by iconographer [[Dimitar Andonov]] the [[zograph]] in 1889. There are many other items, including the putiri made by local masters, a darohranilka of Russian origin, and several paintings of scenes from the New Testament, brought from Jerusalem by pilgrims.

The opening scenes of the film ''[[The Peacemaker (1997 film)|The Peacemaker]]'' were shot in the &quot;St. Dimitrija&quot; church in Bitola, as well as some ''[[Welcome to Sarajevo]]'' scenes.

===Ajdar-kadi mosque===
[[Image:Ajdar Kadi.JPG|thumb|180px|right|Ajdar-kadi mosque]]

The Ajdar-kadi (Turkish judge) Mosque is one of the most attractive monuments of Islamic architecture in Bitola. It was built in the early 1560s, as the project of the famous architect [[Mimar Sinan]], ordered by the Bitola kadija Ajdar-kadi. Over time, it was abandoned and heavily damaged, but recent restoration and conservation has restored to some extent its original appearance.

===Jeni mosque===
The Jeni mosque is located in the center of the city. It has a square base, topped with a cupola. Near the mosque is a minaret, 40 m high. Today, the mosque's rooms house permanent and temporary art exhibitions. Recent archaeological excavations have revealed that it has been built upon an old church.

===Ishak mosque===
The Ishak mosque is the inheritance of the kadi [[Ishak Çelebi]]. In its spacious yard are several tombs, attractive because of the soft, molded shapes of the sarcophagi.

===The old bazaar===
The old [[bazaar]] ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: ''Стара Чаршија'') is mentioned in a description of the city from the 16th and the 17th century. The present bezisten does not differ much in appearance from the original one. The bezisten had 86 shops and 4 large iron gates. The shops used to sell textiles, and today sell food products.

===Deboj Bath===
The Deboj Bath is a [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] bath ([[Turkish bath|hamam]]). It is not known when exactly it was constructed. At one point, it was heavily damaged, but after repairs it regained its original appearance: beautiful facade, two large cupolas and several minor ones.

{{Campaignbox Wars of the Roses}}

The '''Battle of Bosworth Field''' (or the '''Battle of Bosworth''') was the penultimate battle of the [[Wars of the Roses]], the [[civil war]] between the [[House of Lancaster]] and the [[House of York]] that raged across England in the latter half of the 15th century.  Fought on 22&amp;nbsp;August 1485, the battle was won by the Lancastrians.  Their leader [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond]], became the first English monarch of the [[Tudor dynasty]] by his victory and subsequent marriage to a Yorkist princess.  His opponent [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the last king of the House of York, was killed in the battle.  Historians consider Bosworth Field to mark the end of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet dynasty]], making it one of the defining moments of English history.

Richard's reign began in 1483 when he seized the throne from his twelve-year-old nephew [[Edward V of England|Edward V]].  The boy and his younger brother soon disappeared, to the distress of many, and Richard's support was further eroded by rumours of his involvement in the death of his wife.  Across the [[English Channel]] Henry Tudor, a descendant of the greatly diminished House of Lancaster, seized on Richard's difficulties and laid claim to the throne.  Henry's first attempt to invade England in 1483 was frustrated by a storm, but his second arrived unopposed on 1&amp;nbsp;August 1485 on the southwest coast of Wales. Marching inland, Henry gathered support as he made for London.  Richard hurriedly mustered his troops and intercepted Henry's army south of the town of [[Market Bosworth]] in [[Leicestershire]].  [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Lord Thomas Stanley]] and [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|Sir William Stanley]] also brought a force to the battlefield, but held back while they decided which side it would be more advantageous to support.

Richard divided his army, which outnumbered Henry's, into three groups (or &quot;battles&quot;). One was assigned to the [[John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] and another to the [[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]]. Henry kept most of his force together and placed it under the command of the experienced [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]]. Richard's vanguard, commanded by Norfolk, attacked but struggled against Oxford's men, and some of Norfolk's troops fled the field. Northumberland took no action when signalled to assist his king, so Richard decided to gamble everything on a charge across the battlefield to kill Henry and end the fight. Seeing the king's knights separated from his army, the Stanleys intervened; Sir William led his men to Henry's aid, surrounding and killing Richard.  After the battle, Henry was crowned king on Crown Hill.

Henry hired chroniclers to portray his reign favourably; the Battle of Bosworth Field was popularised to represent his Tudor dynasty as the start of a new age. From the 15th to 18th centuries the battle was glamorised as a victory of good over evil, and as the climax of [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Richard III (play)|play]] about Richard's rise and fall, it provides a focal point for critics in later film adaptations. The exact site of the battle is disputed because of the lack of conclusive data, and memorials have been erected at different locations. The Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre was built, in 1974, on a site chosen based on a theory that has been challenged by several scholars and historians in the following years.  In October 2009, a team of researchers, who had performed geological surveys and archaeological digs in the area from 2003, suggested a location two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of [[Ambion Hill]].

During the 15th century, civil war raged across England as the [[House of York|Houses of York]] and [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] fought each other for the English throne.  In 1471, the Yorkists defeated their rivals in the battles of [[Battle of Barnet|Barnet]] and [[Battle of Tewkesbury|Tewkesbury]]. The Lancastrian [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] and his only son, [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Edward of Lancaster]], died in the aftermath of the Battle of Tewkesbury. Their deaths left the House of Lancaster with no direct claimants to the throne.  The Yorkist king, [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], was in complete control of England.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|pp=172&amp;ndash;173}}  He [[Attainder|attainted]] those who refused to submit to his rule, such as [[Jasper Tudor]] and his nephew [[Henry VII of England|Henry]], naming them traitors and confiscating their lands.  The Tudors tried to flee to France but strong winds forced them to land in [[Brittany]], then a semi-independent duchy, where they were taken into the custody of [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany]].{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=17}} Henry's mother, [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]], was a distant descendant of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], uncle of [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]] and father of [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]].{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=3}}  The Beauforts were originally [[Bastard (Law of England and Wales)|bastards]], but Henry IV legitimated them on the condition that their descendants were not eligible to inherit the throne.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=21}}  Henry Tudor, the only remaining Lancastrian noble with a trace of the royal bloodline, had a weak claim to the throne,{{Sfn|Ross|1997|pp=172&amp;ndash;173}} and Edward regarded him as &quot;a nobody&quot;.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=192}}  Francis, however, viewed Henry as a valuable tool to bargain for England's aid and kept the Tudors under his protection.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=192}}

Edward IV died twelve years later on 9&amp;nbsp;April 1483.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=21}}  His twelve-year-old elder son succeeded him as [[Edward V of England|King Edward V]]; the younger son, nine-year-old [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard of Shrewsbury]], was next in line to the throne.  Edward V was too young to rule and a [[Royal Council]] was established to rule the country until the king's coming of age.  The royal court was worried when they learned that the Woodvilles, relatives of the [[Elizabeth Woodville|Queen Mother Elizabeth]], were plotting to seize control of the council.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=65}}  Having offended many in their quest for wealth and power, the Woodville family was not popular.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=35&amp;ndash;43}}  To frustrate the Woodvilles' ambitions, [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|Lord William Hastings]] and other members of the council turned to the new king's uncle&amp;mdash;Richard, [[Richard III of England|Duke of Gloucester]], brother of Edward IV.  The courtiers urged Gloucester to assume the role of Protector quickly, as had been previously requested by his now dead brother.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=40&amp;ndash;41}}  On 29&amp;nbsp;April, Gloucester, accompanied by a contingent of guards and [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]], took Edward V into custody and arrested several prominent members of the Woodville family.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=71&amp;ndash;72}}  After bringing the young king to London, Gloucester had the Woodvilles executed, without trial, on charges of treason.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=63}}

On 13&amp;nbsp;June, Gloucester accused Hastings of plotting with the Woodvilles and had him beheaded.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=83&amp;ndash;85}}  Nine days later, Gloucester convinced [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] to declare the marriage between Edward IV and Elizabeth illegal, rendering their children illegitimate and disqualifying them from the throne.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=88&amp;ndash;91}}  With his nephews out of the way, he was next in the line of succession and was proclaimed King Richard III on 26&amp;nbsp;June.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=93}}  The timing and extrajudicial nature of the deeds done to obtain the throne for Richard won him no popularity, and rumours that spoke ill of the new king spread throughout England.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=94&amp;ndash;95}}  After they were declared bastards, the two princes were confined in the [[Tower of London]] and never seen in public again.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=99&amp;ndash;100}}  Except for those in the north, the people of England firmly believed that Richard, the &quot;tyrant&quot;,{{Sfn|Lander|1981|p=327}} had murdered his nephews.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=104}}

Discontent with Richard's actions manifested itself in the summer after he took control of the country, as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne.  The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=105&amp;ndash;111}}  Their plans were co-ordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne.  The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham.  No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian [[Charles Ross (historian)|Charles Ross]] proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=116}}  Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.{{Sfn|Jones|Underwood|1993|p=64}}

[[File:Elizabeth of York, right facing portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A blond woman with rosy cheeks holds a white rose. She wears a gilded black shawl over her head, and a red robe trimmed in white spotted fur.|Elizabeth of York: rumours of her marriage launched Henry's invasion.]]
The plan was to stage uprisings within a short time in southern and western England, overwhelming Richard's forces.  Buckingham would support the rebels by invading from Wales, while Henry came in by sea.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=112&amp;ndash;115}}  Bad timing and weather wrecked the plot.  An uprising in [[Kent]] started 10&amp;nbsp;days prematurely, alerting Richard to muster the royal army and take steps to put down the insurrections.  Richard's spies informed him of Buckingham's activities, and the king's men captured and destroyed the bridges across the [[River Severn]].  When Buckingham and his army reached the river, they found it swollen and impossible to cross because of a violent storm that broke on 15&amp;nbsp;October.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=115&amp;ndash;116}}  Buckingham was trapped and had no safe place to retreat; his Welsh enemies seized his home castle after he had set forth with his army.  The duke abandoned his plans and fled to [[Wem]], where he was betrayed by his servant and arrested by Richard's men.  On 2&amp;nbsp;November, he was executed.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=117}}  Henry had attempted a landing on 10&amp;nbsp;October (or 19&amp;nbsp;October), but his fleet was scattered by a storm.  He reached the coast of England (at either [[Plymouth]] or [[Poole]]), and a group of soldiers hailed him to come ashore.  They were, in truth, Richard's men, prepared to capture Henry once he set foot on English soil.  Henry was not deceived and returned to Brittany, abandoning the invasion.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=26&amp;ndash;27}}  Without Buckingham or Henry, the rebellion was easily crushed by Richard.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=117}}

The survivors of the failed uprisings fled to Brittany, where they openly supported Henry's claim to the throne.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=118}}  At Christmas, Henry Tudor swore an oath to marry Edward IV's daughter, [[Elizabeth of York]], to unite the warring houses of York and Lancaster.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=196}}  Henry's rising prominence made him a great threat to Richard, and the Yorkist king made several overtures to the Duke of Brittany to surrender the young Lancastrian.  Francis refused, holding out for the possibility of better terms from Richard.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=19}}  In mid-1484, Francis was incapacitated by illness and while recuperating, his treasurer, Peter Landois, took over the reins of government.  Landois reached an agreement with Richard to send back Henry and his uncle in exchange for military and financial aid.  John Morton, a bishop of [[Flanders]],&lt;!--not [[John Morton (archbishop)]], who was Bishop of Ely at this time --&gt; learned of the scheme and warned the Tudors, who fled to France.{{Sfn|Lander|1981|p=324}}  The French court allowed them to stay; the Tudors were useful pawns to ensure that Richard's England did not interfere with French plans to annex Brittany.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=31}}  On 16&amp;nbsp;March 1485, Richard's queen, [[Anne Neville]], died,{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=144}} and rumours spread across the country that she was murdered to pave the way for Richard to marry his niece, Elizabeth.  The gossip alienated Richard from some of his northern supporters,{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=145&amp;ndash;146}} and upset Henry across the [[English Channel]].{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=38}}  The loss of Elizabeth's hand in marriage could unravel the alliance between Henry's supporters who were Lancastrians and those who were loyalists to Edward IV.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=39}}  Anxious to secure his bride, Henry assembled approximately 2,000&amp;nbsp;men and set sail from France on 1&amp;nbsp;August.{{Sfn|Lander|1981|p=325}}

By the 15th century, English [[chivalry|chivalric]] ideas of selfless service to the king had been [[Bastard feudalism|corrupted]].{{Sfn|Harriss|2007|pp=184&amp;ndash;185}}  Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in individual estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to their lord's call to arms, and each noble had exclusive authority over his [[Militia (English)|militia]].  Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through the support of his nobles.  Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships.{{Sfn|Downing|1992|pp=159&amp;ndash;160}}  Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side or else they might turn against him.{{Sfn|Downing|1992|p=59}}  Three groups, each with their own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=47}}

===Yorkist===
Small and slender, Richard III did not have the robust physique associated with many of his Plantagenet predecessors.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=138}}  However, he enjoyed rough sports and activities that were considered manly.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=142}}  His performances on the battlefield impressed his brother greatly, and he became Edward's right hand man.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=21&amp;ndash;22}}  During the 1480s, Richard defended the northern borders of England.  In 1482, Edward charged him to lead an army into Scotland with the aim of replacing [[James III of Scotland|King James III]] with the [[Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]].{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=44&amp;ndash;45}}  Richard's army [[Capture of Berwick (1482)|broke through the Scottish defences and occupied the capital]], Edinburgh, but Albany decided to give up his claim to the throne in return for the post of Lieutenant General of Scotland.  As well as obtaining a guarantee that the Scottish government would concede territories and diplomatic benefits to the English crown, Richard's campaign retook the town of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], which the Scots had conquered in 1460.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=45&amp;ndash;47}}  Edward was not satisfied by these gains,{{Sfn|Lander|1981|p=327}} which, according to Ross, could have been greater if Richard had been resolute enough to capitalise on the situation while in control of Edinburgh.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|pp=289&amp;ndash;290}}  In her analysis of Richard's character, Christine Carpenter sees him as a soldier who was more used to taking orders than giving them.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=210}} However, he was not averse to displaying his militaristic streak; on ascending the throne he made known his desire to lead a [[Crusades|crusade]] against &quot;not only the Turks, but all [his] foes&quot;.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=142}}

Richard's most loyal subject was [[John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk]].{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=168}}  The duke served Richard's brother for many years and was one of Edward IV's closer confidantes.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=226}}  He was a military veteran, having fought in the [[Battle of Towton]] in 1461 and served as Hastings' deputy at Calais in 1471.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|pp=36, 181}}  Ross speculates that he may have borne a grudge against Edward for depriving him of a fortune.  Norfolk was due to inherit a share of the wealthy Mowbray estate on the death of eight-year-old [[Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk|Anne de Mowbray]], the last of her family. However, Edward convinced Parliament to circumvent the law of inheritance and transfer the estate to his younger son, who was married to Anne.  Consequently, Howard supported Richard III in deposing Edward's sons, for which he received the dukedom of Norfolk and his original share of the Mowbray estate.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=35&amp;ndash;38, 175}}

[[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland]], also supported Richard's seizure of the throne of England.  The Percys were loyal Lancastrians, but Edward IV eventually won the earl's allegiance.  Northumberland had been captured and imprisoned by the Yorkists in 1461, losing his titles and estates; however, Edward released him eight years later and restored his earldom.{{Sfn|Hicks|2002|p=280}}  From that time Northumberland served the Yorkist crown, helping to defend northern England and maintain its peace.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=180}}  Initially the earl had issues with Richard III as Edward groomed his brother to be the leading power of the north.  Northumberland was mollified when he was promised he would be the [[Lord Warden of the Marches|Warden of the East March]], a position that was formerly hereditary for the Percys.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=185}} He served under Richard during the 1482 invasion of Scotland, and the allure of being in a position to dominate the north of England if Richard went south to assume the crown was his likely motivation for supporting Richard's bid for kingship.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=78}}  However, after becoming king, Richard began moulding his nephew, [[John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln]], to manage the north, passing over Northumberland for the position.  According to Carpenter, although the earl was amply compensated he despaired of any possibility of advancement under Richard.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=215}}

===Lancastrian===
Henry Tudor was unfamiliar with the arts of war and a stranger to the land he was trying to conquer.  He spent the first fourteen years of his life in Wales and the next fourteen in Brittany and France.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=3, 15&amp;ndash;17}}  Slender but strong and decisive, Henry lacked a penchant for battle and was not much of a warrior; chroniclers such as [[Polydore Vergil]] and ambassadors like [[Pedro de Ayala]] found him more interested in commerce and finance.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=299, 301, 318}}  Having not fought in any battles,{{Sfn|Saccio|2000|p=183}} Henry recruited several experienced veterans on whom he could rely for military advice and the command of his armies.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=211}}
&lt;!-- Mediaeval historian Thomas Brynmor Pugh believes that instead of participating in the battle, Jasper stayed behind in Wales to secure an escape route for his nephew, in case the battle was lost.{{Sfn|Pugh|1992|p=50}}--&gt;

[[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford]] was Henry's principal military commander.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=54}}  He was adept in the arts of war.  At the Battle of Barnet, he commanded the Lancastrian right wing and routed the division opposing him.  However, as a result of confusion over identities, Oxford's group came under [[friendly fire]] from the Lancastrian main force and retreated from the field.  The earl fled abroad and continued his fight against the Yorkists, raiding shipping and eventually capturing the island fort of [[St Michael's Mount]] in 1473. He surrendered after receiving no aid or reinforcement, but in 1484 escaped from prison and joined Henry's court in France, bringing along his erstwhile gaoler [[James Blount|Sir James Blount]].{{Sfn|Britnell|1997|p=101}}  Oxford's presence raised morale in Henry's camp and troubled Richard III.{{Sfn|Gravett|1999|p=15}}

===Stanleys===
In the early stages of the Wars of the Roses the Stanleys of Cheshire were predominantly Lancastrians.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=159}}  Sir [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|William Stanley]], however, was a staunch Yorkist supporter, fighting in the [[Battle of Blore Heath]] in 1459 and helping Hastings to put down uprisings against Edward IV in 1471.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hicks|2002|p=163}}; {{Harvnb|Ross|1997|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Richard took the crown, Sir William showed no inclination to turn against the new king, refraining from joining Buckingham's rebellion, for which he was amply rewarded.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=212}}  Sir William's elder brother, [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley]], was not as steadfast.  By 1485, he had served three kings, namely Henry VI, Edward IV, and Richard III.  Lord Stanley's skilled political manoeuvrings&amp;mdash;vacillating between opposing sides until it was clear who would be the winner&amp;mdash;gained him high positions;{{Sfn|Coward|1983|pp=2, 9&amp;ndash;10}} he was Henry's chamberlain and Edward's steward.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=334}}  His non-committal stance, until the crucial point of a battle, earned him the loyalty of his men, who felt he would not needlessly send them to their deaths.{{Sfn|Gravett|1999|p=15}}

Even though Lord Stanley had served as Edward IV's steward, his relations with the king's brother, the eventual Richard III, were not cordial.  The two had conflicts with each other that erupted into violence around March 1470.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=134}}  Furthermore, having taken Lady Margaret as his second wife in June 1472,{{Sfn|Jones|Underwood|1993|p=59}} Stanley was Henry Tudor's stepfather, a relationship which did him nothing to win Richard's favour.  Despite these differences, Stanley did not join [[Buckingham's revolt]] in 1483.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=212}}  When Richard executed those conspirators who were unable to flee England,{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=117}} he spared Lady Margaret.  However, he forfeited her titles and transferred her estates to Stanley's name, to be held in trust for the Yorkist crown.  Richard's act of mercy was calculated to reconcile with Stanley,{{Sfn|Jones|Underwood|1993|p=64}} but it may have been to no avail—Carpenter has identified a further cause of friction in Richard's intention to reopen an old land dispute that involved Thomas Stanley and the Harrington family.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=216}}  Edward IV had ruled the case in favour of Stanley in 1473,{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=409}} but Richard planned to overturn his brother's ruling and give the wealthy estate to the Harringtons.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=216}}  Wary of Stanley, Richard took his son, [[George Stanley, 9th Baron Strange|Lord Strange]], as hostage to discourage him from joining Henry.{{Sfn|Horrox|1991|p=323}}

The Stanleys stood at the south, observing the situation.]]
Henry's crossing of the English Channel in 1485 was without incident. He sailed from [[Harfleur]] on 1&amp;nbsp;August and, with fair winds, landed at Mill Bay on the north side of [[Milford Haven]] on 7&amp;nbsp;August, easily capturing nearby Dale Castle.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=40&amp;ndash;41, 342}} Although hailed by contemporary Welsh bards as the native prince to bring their country back to glory,{{Sfn|Elton|2003|p=89}} Henry received a muted response from the local population. No joyous welcome awaited him on shore, and few individual Welshmen joined his army as it marched inland.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=211&amp;ndash;212}} Historian [[Geoffrey Elton]] suggests only Henry's ardent supporters felt pride over his Welsh blood.{{Sfn|Elton|2003|pp=88&amp;ndash;89}} It was a different story when Henry moved to [[Haverfordwest]], the county town of [[Pembrokeshire]]. Richard's lieutenant in South Wales, Sir Walter Herbert, failed to move against Henry, and two of his officers, Richard Griffith and Evan Morgan, deserted to Henry with their men.{{Sfn|Rowse|1998|p=215}}

Henry also won over [[Rhys ap Thomas]], who was the leading figure in West Wales.{{Sfn|Rowse|1998|p=215}} Another prominent local figure, [[Rhys Fawr ap Maredudd]], also joined Henry.{{Sfn|Gravett|1999|p=40}} Rhys ap Thomas's defection, in particular, was a coup for Henry. Richard had appointed Rhys Lieutenant in West Wales for his refusal to join Buckingham's rebellion, asking that he surrender his son [[Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas]] as surety, although by some accounts Rhys had managed to evade this condition. However, Henry successfully courted Rhys, offering the Lieutenancy of Wales in exchange for his fealty. Henry marched via [[Aberystwyth]] while Rhys followed a separate, more southerly route, recruiting 500 Welshmen ''en route'' to swell Henry's army when they reunited at [[Welshpool]].{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=42&amp;ndash;43}} By 15 or 16&amp;nbsp;August, Henry and his men had crossed the English border, making for the town of [[Shrewsbury]].{{Sfn|Gravett|1999|p=40}}

Since 22&amp;nbsp;June 1485 Richard had been aware of Henry's impending invasion, and had ordered his lords to maintain a high level of readiness.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=208&amp;ndash;209}}  News of Henry's landing reached Richard on 11&amp;nbsp;August, but it took three to four days for his messengers to notify his lords of their king's mobilisation.  On 16&amp;nbsp;August, the Yorkist army started to gather; Norfolk set off for [[Leicester]], the assembly point, that night.  The city of York, a traditional stronghold of Richard's family, asked the king for instructions, and receiving a reply three days later sent 80&amp;nbsp;men to join the king.  Simultaneously Northumberland, whose northern territory was the most distant from the capital, had gathered his men and ridden to Leicester.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=212&amp;ndash;215}}

Although London was his goal,{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=44}} Henry did not move directly towards the city. After resting in Shrewsbury, his forces went eastwards and picked up Gilbert Talbot and other English allies, including deserters from Richard's forces.  Although its size had increased substantially since the landing, Henry's army was not yet large enough to contend with the numbers Richard could muster.  Henry's pace through [[Staffordshire]] was slow, delaying the confrontation with Richard so that he could gather more recruits to his cause.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=212}}  Henry had been communicating on friendly terms with the Stanleys for some time before setting foot in England,{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=39}} and the Stanleys had mobilised their forces on hearing of Henry's landing. They ranged themselves ahead of Henry's march through the English countryside,{{Sfn|Gravett|1999|pp=44&amp;ndash;45}} meeting twice in secret with Henry as he moved through Staffordshire.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=217}}  At the second of these, at [[Atherstone]] in [[Warwickshire]], they conferred &quot;in what sort to arraign battle with King Richard, whom they heard to be not far off&quot;.{{Sfn|Rowse|1998|loc=p. 217: a quote from Vergil}}  On 21&amp;nbsp;August, the Stanleys were making camp on the slopes of a hill north of [[Dadlington]], while Henry encamped his army at White Moors to the northwest of their camp.{{Sfn|Gravett|1999|p=45}}

On 20&amp;nbsp;August, Richard reached Leicester, joining Norfolk.  Northumberland arrived the following day.  The royal army proceeded westwards to intercept Henry's march on London.  Passing [[Sutton Cheney]], Richard moved his army towards [[Ambion Hill]]—which he thought would be of tactical value—and made camp on it.{{Sfn|Gravett|1999|p=45}}  Richard's sleep was not peaceful and, according to the ''[[Croyland Chronicle]]'', in the morning his face was &quot;more livid and ghastly than usual&quot;.{{Sfn|Gravett|1999|p=46}}

==Engagement==

Northumberland and Lord Stanley remain stationary.|Late battle (a scenario based on historical interpretations): Richard led a small group of men around the main battle and charged Henry, who was moving towards the Stanleys. William Stanley rode to Henry's rescue.]]

The Yorkist army, numbering about 10,000&amp;nbsp;men, deployed on the hilltop{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=215}}{{Sfn|Mackie|1983|p=52}} along the ridgeline from west to east.  Norfolk's group (or &quot;battle&quot; in the parlance of the time) of spearmen stood on the right flank, protecting the cannon and about 1,200&amp;nbsp;archers.  Richard's group, comprising 3,000&amp;nbsp;infantry, formed the centre.  Northumberland's men guarded the left flank; he had approximately 4,000&amp;nbsp;men, many of them mounted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gravett|1999|pp=54&amp;ndash;55}}; {{Harvnb|Ross|1999|pp=217&amp;ndash;218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Standing on the hilltop, Richard had a wide, unobstructed view of the area.  He could see the Stanleys and their 6,000 men holding their position at Dadlington Hill, while to the southwest was Henry's army.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=217}}

Henry had very few Englishmen&amp;mdash;fewer than a thousand&amp;mdash;in his army.  Between three and five hundred of them were exiles who had fled from Richard's rule,{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=40}} and the remainder were Talbot's men and recent deserters from Richard's army.  Historian John Mackie believes that 1,800&amp;nbsp;French mercenaries, led by Philibert de Chandée, formed the core of Henry's army.{{Sfn|Mackie|1983|p=51}} [[John Mair]], writing thirty-five years after the battle, claimed that this force contained a significant Scottish component,{{Sfn|Major|1892|p=393}} and this claim is accepted by some modern writers,{{Sfn|Gravett|1999|pp=34&amp;ndash;36}} but Mackie reasons that the French would not have released their [[Garde Ecossaise|elite Scottish knights and archers]], and concludes that there were probably few Scottish troops in the army, although he accepts the presence of captains like [[Bernard Stewart, Lord of Aubigny]].{{Sfn|Mackie|1983|p=51}}{{Sfn|Major|1892|p=393}} In total, Henry's army was around 5,000 strong,{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=215}}{{Sfn|Mackie|1983|p=52}} a substantial portion of which was made up by the recruits picked up in Wales. Rhys ap Thomas's Welsh force was described as being large enough to have &quot;annihilated&quot; the rest of Henry's force.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=213}}

In their interpretations of the vague mentions of the battle in the old text, historians placed areas near the foot of Ambion Hill as likely regions where the two armies clashed, and thought up possible scenarios of the engagement.{{Sfn|Hicks|1995|p=23}}{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=216}}{{Sfn|Gravett|1999|pp=46&amp;ndash;52}}  In their recreations of the battle, Henry started by moving his army towards Ambion Hill where Richard and his men stood.  As Henry's army advanced past the marsh at the southwestern foot of the hill, Richard sent a message to Stanley, threatening to execute his son, Strange, if Stanley did not join the attack on Henry immediately.  Stanley replied that he had other sons.  Incensed, Richard gave the order to behead Strange but his officers temporised, saying that battle was imminent, and it would be more convenient to carry out the execution afterwards.{{Sfn|Rowse|1998|p=219}}  Henry had also sent messengers to Stanley asking him to declare his allegiance.  The reply was evasive&amp;mdash;the Stanleys would &quot;naturally&quot; come, after Henry had given orders to his army and arranged them for battle. Henry had no choice but to confront Richard's forces alone.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=47}}

Well aware of his own military inexperience, Henry handed command of his army to Oxford and retired to the rear with his bodyguards.  Oxford, seeing the vast line of Richard's army strung along the ridgeline, decided to keep his men together instead of splitting them into the traditional three battles: vanguard, centre, and rearguard.  He ordered the troops to stray no further than {{convert|10|ft|m}} from their banners, fearing that they would become enveloped.  Individual groups clumped together, forming a single large mass flanked by horsemen on the wings.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=48}}

[[File:Battle of Bosworth Field diorama.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Miniatures of knights, archers, and infantry on tufted sand depict an instance of the battle.|The clash between Richard's and Henry's armies as depicted by Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre]]
The Lancastrians were harassed by Richard's cannon as they manoeuvred around the marsh, seeking firmer ground.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=220&amp;ndash;221}}  Once Oxford and his men were clear of the marsh, Norfolk's battle and several contingents of Richard's group started to advance.  Hails of arrows showered both sides as they closed.  Oxford's men proved the steadier in the ensuing hand-to-hand combat; they held their ground and several of Norfolk's men, recruits from southern England, fled the field.{{Sfn|Adams|2002|p=19}}  Recognising that his force was at a disadvantage, Richard signalled for Northumberland to assist but Northumberland's group showed no signs of movement.  Historians, such as Horrox and Pugh, believe Northumberland chose not to aid his king for personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Horrox|1991|pp=319&amp;ndash;320}}; Pugh (1992), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ross doubts the aspersions cast on Northumberland's loyalty, suggesting instead that Ambion Hill's narrow ridge hindered him from joining the battle. The earl would have had to either go through his allies or execute a wide flanking move&amp;mdash;near impossible to perform given the standard of drill at the time&amp;mdash;to engage Oxford's men.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=221&amp;ndash;223}}

At this juncture Henry rode off towards the Stanleys.  Seeing this, Richard decided to end the fight quickly by killing the enemy commander.  He led a charge of 800&amp;nbsp;mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry's group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gravett|1999|p=69}}; {{Harvnb|Ross|1999|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer [[William Brandon (standard-bearer)|Sir William Brandon]] in the initial charge and unhorsed burly [[John Cheyne, Baron Cheyne|John Cheyne]], Edward IV's former standard-bearer,{{Sfn|Horrox|1991|p=325}} with a blow to the head from his broken lance.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=49}}  Henry's bodyguards surrounded their master and succeeded in keeping him away from the Yorkist king.  On seeing Richard embroiled with Henry's men and separated from his main force, William Stanley made his move.  He led his men into the fight at Henry's side.  Outnumbered, Richard's group was surrounded and gradually pressed back against the marsh.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=49}}  Richard's banner man&amp;mdash;Sir Percival Thirwell&amp;mdash;lost his legs but held the Yorkist banner aloft until he was hacked to death.{{Sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}  The king's horse got mired in the soft ground and he was forced to continue the fight on foot.{{Sfn|Gravett|1999|p=73}}  His followers offered him their horses to escape but Richard refused.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=224}}  All chroniclers agree that Richard fought bravely to the end;{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=49}}{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=225}} overwhelmed by the masses of Welsh spearmen around him, the last Yorkist king died on the battlefield.{{Sfn|Elton|2003|p=89}}{{Sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}  Richard's forces disintegrated as news of his death spread.  Northumberland and his men fled north on seeing the king's fate, and Norfolk was killed.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=49}}

==Post-battle==
[[File:Lord Stanley Brings the Crown of Richard (wide).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Against a background of cheering men, an armoured man on the left hands a crown to a mounted armoured man on the right.|Finding Richard's circlet after the battle, Lord Stanley hands it to Henry.]]
After the battle, Richard's [[circlet]] was found and brought to Henry, who was crowned king at the top of Crown Hill, near the village of Stoke Golding.  According to Vergil, Henry's official historian, Lord Stanley found the circlet. Historian Stanley Chrimes and Professor Sydney Anglo dismiss the legend of the crown's finding in a [[Crataegus|hawthorn bush]]; none of the contemporary sources reported such an event.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=49}}  Ross, however, does not ignore the legend.  He opines that the hawthorn bush would not be part of Henry's coat of arms if it did not have a strong relationship to his ascendance.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=52}}  In Vergil's chronicle, 100 of Henry's men, compared to 1,000 of Richard's, died in this battle&amp;mdash;a ratio Chrimes believes to be an exaggeration.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=49}}  The bodies of the fallen were brought to St James Church at Dadlington for burial.{{Sfn|Battlefields Trust|2004|loc=&quot;[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/warsoftheroses/battlepageview.asp?pageid=392 Battlefield Monuments]}}  However, Henry denied any immediate rest for Richard; instead the last Yorkist king's corpse was stripped naked and strapped across a horse.  His body was brought to Leicester and openly exhibited in a church to show his death.  After two days, the corpse was interred in a plain unmarked tomb.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|pp=225&amp;ndash;226}}

Henry dismissed the mercenaries in his force, retaining only a small core of local soldiers to form the &quot;[[Yeomen of the Guard|Yeomen of his Garde]]&quot;,{{Sfn|Mackie|1983|p=58}} and proceeded to establish his rule of England.  He convinced Parliament to reverse his attainder and record Richard's kingship as illegal, although the Yorkist king's reign remained officially in the annals of England history.  The proclamation of Edward IV's children as illegitimate was also reversed, restoring Elizabeth's status to a royal princess.{{Sfn|Baker|2003|pp=58&amp;ndash;59}}  The marriage of Elizabeth, the heiress to the House of York, to Henry, the master of the House of Lancaster, marked the end of the feud between the two houses and the start of the [[Tudor dynasty]].  The royal matrimony, however, was delayed until Henry was crowned king and had established his claim on the throne firmly enough to preclude that of Elizabeth and her kin.{{Sfn|Laynesmith|2005|p=81}}  Henry further convinced Parliament to backdate his reign to the day before the battle,{{Sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}} effectively enabling those who fought against him at Bosworth Field to be declared traitors.{{Sfn|Baker|2003|p=59}}  Northumberland, who had remained inactive during the battle, was imprisoned but later released and reinstated to pacify the north in Henry's name.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=222}}  The purge of those who fought for Richard occupied Henry's first two years of rule, although later he proved prepared to accept those who submitted to him regardless of their former allegiances.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|pp=224&amp;ndash;225}}

Of his supporters, Henry rewarded the Stanleys the most generously.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|p=54}}  Aside from making William his chamberlain, he bestowed the earldom of Derby upon Lord Stanley along with grants and offices in other estates.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=223}}  Henry rewarded Oxford by restoring to him the lands and titles confiscated by the Yorkists and appointing him as [[Constable of the Tower]] and admiral of England, Ireland, and [[Aquitaine]].  For his kin, Henry created Jasper Tudor the Duke of Bedford.{{Sfn|Chrimes|1999|pp=54&amp;ndash;55}}  He returned to his mother the lands and grants stripped from her by Richard, and proved to be a filial son, installing her as Queen Mother in the palace and faithfully attending to her throughout his reign.  Parliament's declaration of Margaret as ''femme sole'' effectively empowered her; she no longer needed to manage her estates through Stanley.{{Sfn|Jones|Underwood|1993|pp=98&amp;ndash;99}}  Elton points out that despite his initial largesse, Henry's supporters at Bosworth would only enjoy his special favour for the short term; in later years, he would instead promote those who best served his interests.{{Sfn|Elton|2003|pp=78&amp;ndash;80}}

Like the kings before him, Henry faced dissenters.  The first open revolt occurred two years after Bosworth Field;  [[Lambert Simnel]] claimed to be [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick]], who was Edward IV's nephew.  The Earl of Lincoln backed him for the throne and led rebel forces in the name of the House of York.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=222}}  The rebel army fended off several attacks by Northumberland's forces, before engaging Henry's army at the [[Battle of Stoke Field]] on 16&amp;nbsp;June 1487.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=223}}  Oxford and Bedford led Henry's men,{{Sfn|Mackie|1983|p=73}} including several former supporters of Richard III.{{Sfn|Horrox|1991|p=318}}  Henry won this battle easily, but other malcontents and conspiracies would follow.{{Sfn|Pugh|1992|pp=52&amp;ndash;56}}  A rebellion in 1489 started with Northumberland's murder; military historian Michael C. C. Adams says that the author of a note, which was left next to Northumberland's body, blamed the earl for Richard's death.{{Sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}

==Legacy==
Contemporary accounts of the Battle of Bosworth Field can be found in four main sources, one of which is the English ''Croyland Chronicle'', written by a senior Yorkist chronicler who relied on second-hand information from nobles and soldiers.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=6}}  The other accounts were written by foreigners&amp;mdash;Vergil, Jean Molinet, and Diego de Valera.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=4, 7}}  Whereas Molinet was sympathetic to Richard,{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=7}} Vergil was in Henry's service and drew information from the king and his subjects to portray them in a good light.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}}  Diego de Valera, whose information Ross regards as unreliable,{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=216}} compiled his work from letters of Spanish merchants.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=7}}  However, other historians have used Valera's work to deduce possibly valuable insights not readily evident in other sources.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=8}}  Ross finds the poem, ''The Ballad of Bosworth Field'', a useful source to ascertain certain details of the battle.  The multitude of different accounts, mostly based on second- or third-hand information, has proved an obstacle to historians as they try to reconstruct the battle.{{Sfn|Ross|1999|p=216}}  Their common complaint is that, except for its outcome, very few details of the battle are found in the chronicles.  According to historian [[Michael Hicks]], the Battle of Bosworth Field is one of the worst-recorded clashes of the Wars of the Roses.{{Sfn|Hicks|1995|p=23}}

[[File:Battle of Bosworth Field re-enactment.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An armoured and mounted man leads a small party, similarly dressed in mediaeval attire, along a road.|Newport History Society re-enacts Henry's march through Wales to Bosworth Field during the battle's quincentenary.]]
Henry tried to present his victory as a new beginning for the country;{{Sfn|Burrow|2000|p=11}} he hired chroniclers to portray his reign as a &quot;modern age&quot; with its dawn in 1485.{{Sfn|Carpenter|2002|p=219}}  Hicks states that the works of Vergil and the blind historian [[Bernard André]], promoted by subsequent Tudor administrations, became the authoritative sources for writers for the next four hundred years.{{Sfn|Hicks|1995|pp=28, 39}}  As such, Tudor literature paints a flattering picture of Henry's reign, depicting the Battle of Bosworth Field as the final clash of the civil war and downplaying the subsequent uprisings.{{Sfn|Hicks|1995|p=23}}  For England the [[Middle Ages]] ended in 1485, and [[English Heritage]] claims that other than [[William the Conqueror]]'s  successful [[Battle of Hastings|invasion]] of 1066, no other year holds more significance in English history.  By portraying Richard as a hunchbacked tyrant who usurped the throne by killing his nephews, the Tudor historians attached a sense of myth to the battle: it became an epic clash between good and evil with a satisfying moral outcome.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=11}}  According to [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] Colin Burrow, André was so overwhelmed by the historic significance of the battle that he represented it with a blank page in his ''Henry VII'' (1502).{{Sfn|Burrow|2000|p=12}}  For Professor Peter Saccio, the battle was indeed a unique clash in the annals of English history, because &quot;the victory was determined, not by those who fought, but by those who delayed fighting until they were sure of being on the winning side.&quot;{{Sfn|Saccio|2000|p=183}}

Historians such as Adams and Horrox believe that Richard lost the battle not for any mythic reasons, but because of morale and loyalty problems in his army. Most of the common soldiers found it difficult to fight for a liege whom they distrusted, and some lords believed that their situation might improve if Richard was dethroned.{{Sfn|Adams|2002|p=19}}{{Sfn|Horrox|1991|p=318}}  According to Adams, against such duplicities Richard's desperate charge was the only knightly behaviour on the field.  As fellow historian Michael Bennet puts it, the attack was &quot;the swan-song of [mediaeval] English chivalry&quot;.{{Sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}  Adams believes this view was shared at the time by the printer [[William Caxton]], who enjoyed sponsorship from Edward IV and Richard III.  Nine days after the battle, Caxton published [[Thomas Malory]]'s story about chivalry and death by betrayal&amp;mdash;''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''&amp;mdash;seemingly as a response to the circumstances of Richard's death.{{Sfn|Adams|2002|p=20}}

Elton does not believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, pointing out that the 20th century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration.  In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle&amp;mdash;no-one even knows exactly where it took place&amp;mdash;demonstrates its insignificance to English society.  Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.{{Sfn|Elton|2003|p=78}}  Mackie agrees that contemporary historians, wary of the three royal successions during the long Wars of the Roses, considered Bosworth Field just another in a lengthy series of such battles.  It was through the works and efforts of [[Francis Bacon]] and his successors that the public started to believe the battle had decided their futures by bringing about &quot;the fall of a tyrant&quot;.{{Sfn|Mackie|1983|p=7}}  Mackie concludes that, in hindsight, Bosworth Field is notable as the decisive battle that established a dynasty which would rule unchallenged over England for more than a hundred years.{{Sfn|Mackie|1983|p=8}}

===Shakespearian dramatisation===
[[William Shakespeare]] gives prominence to the Battle of Bosworth Field in his play, ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.  It is the &quot;one big battle&quot;; no other fighting scene distracts the audience from this action,{{Sfn|Grene|2001|p=92}} represented by a one-on-one swordfight between Henry Tudor and Richard III.{{Sfn|Edelman|1992|p=80}}  Shakespeare uses their duel to bring a climactic end to the play and the Wars of the Roses; he also uses it to champion morality, portraying the &quot;unequivocal triumph of good over evil&quot;.{{Sfn|Grene|2001|p=93}}  Richard, the villainous lead character, has been built up in the battles of Shakespeare's earlier play, ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', as a &quot;formidable swordsman and a courageous military leader&quot;&amp;mdash;in contrast to the dastardly means by which he becomes king in ''Richard III''.{{Sfn|Edelman|1992|p=79}}  Although the Battle of Bosworth Field has only five sentences to direct it, three scenes and more than four hundred lines precede the action, developing the background and motivations for the characters in anticipation of the battle.{{Sfn|Grene|2001|p=93}}

Shakespeare's account of the battle was mostly based on chroniclers [[Edward Hall]]'s and [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s dramatic versions of history, which were sourced from Vergil's chronicle.  However, Shakespeare's attitude towards Richard was shaped by scholar [[Thomas More]], whose writings displayed extreme bias against the Yorkist king.{{Sfn|Lull|Shakespeare|1999|p=1}}  The result of these influences is a script that vilifies the king, and Shakespeare had few qualms about departing from history to incite drama.{{Sfn|Saccio|2000|p=14}}  Margaret of Anjou died in 1482, but Shakespeare had her speak to Richard's mother before the battle to foreshadow Richard's fate and fulfil the prophecy she had given in ''Henry VI''.{{Sfn|Lull|Shakespeare|1999|p=48}}  Shakespeare exaggerated the cause of Richard's restless night before the battle, imagining it as a haunting by the ghosts of those whom the king had murdered, including Buckingham.{{Sfn|Grene|2001|p=154}}  Richard is portrayed as suffering a pang of conscience, but as he speaks he regains his confidence and asserts that he will be evil, if such needed to retain his crown.{{Sfn|Lull|Shakespeare|1999|p=18}}

The fight between the two armies is simulated by rowdy noises made off-stage (''alarums'' or alarms) while actors walk on-stage, deliver their lines, and exit.  To build anticipation for the duel, Shakespeare requests more ''alarums'' after Richard's councillor, [[William Catesby]], announces that the king is &quot;[enacting] more wonders than a man&quot;.  Richard punctuates his entrance with the classic line, &quot;A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!&quot;{{Sfn|Edelman|1992|p=80}}  He refuses to withdraw, continuing to seek to slay Henry's doubles until he has killed his nemesis.  There is no documentary evidence that Henry had five [[Political decoy|decoys]] at Bosworth Field; the idea was Shakespeare's invention.  He drew inspiration from [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]'s use of them at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] (1403) to amplify the perception of Richard's courage on the battlefield.{{Sfn|Edelman|1992|p=81}}  Similarly, the single combat between Henry and Richard is Shakespeare's creation.  ''The True Tragedy of Richard III'', a play earlier than Shakespeare's, has no signs of staging such an encounter: its stage directions give not a hint of visible combat.{{Sfn|Edelman|1992|pp=16&amp;ndash;17}}

Men dressed as soldiers lounge and drink behind the props.|''The Battle of Bosworth Field, a Scene in the Great Drama of History'', illustrating Beckett's mocking of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] attitude towards history]]
Despite the dramatic licences taken, Shakespeare's version of the Battle of Bosworth Field was the model of the event for English textbooks for many years during the 18th and 19th centuries.{{Sfn|Mitchell|2000|p=209}}  This glamorised version of history, promulgated in books and paintings and played out on stages across the country, perturbed humorist [[Gilbert Abbott à Beckett]].{{Sfn|Mitchell|2000|p=208}}  He voiced his criticism in the form of a poem, equating the romantic view of the battle to watching a &quot;fifth-rate production of ''Richard III''&quot;: shabbily costumed actors fight the Battle of Bosworth Field on-stage while those with lesser roles lounge at the back, showing no interest in the proceedings.{{Sfn|Mitchell|2000|pp=209&amp;ndash;210}}

In [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[Richard III (1955 film)|1955 film adaptation]] of ''Richard III'', the Battle of Bosworth Field is represented not by a single duel but a general melee that became the film's most recognised scene and a regular screening at Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|1990|p=74}}; {{Harvnb|English Heritage|1995|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film depicts the clash between the Yorkist and Lancastrian armies on an open field, focusing on individual characters amidst the savagery of hand-to-hand fighting, and received accolades for the realism portrayed.{{Sfn|Davies|1990|pp=74&amp;ndash;75, 135}}  One reviewer for ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' newspaper, however, was not impressed, finding the number of combatants too sparse for the wide plains and a lack of subtlety in Richard's death scene.{{Sfn|Davies|1990|p=176}}  The means by which Richard is shown to prepare his army for the battle also earned acclaim.  As Richard speaks to his men and draws his plans in the sand using his sword, his units appear on-screen, arraying themselves according to the lines that Richard had drawn.  Intimately woven together, the combination of pictorial and narrative elements effectively turns Richard into a storyteller, who acts out the plot he has constructed.{{Sfn|Davies|1990|p=75}}  Shakespearian critic Herbert Coursen extends that imagery: Richard sets himself up as a creator of men, but dies amongst the savagery of his creations.  Coursen finds the depiction a contrast to that of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] and his &quot;band of brothers&quot;.{{Sfn|Coursen|2000|pp=100&amp;ndash;101}}

The adaptation of the setting for ''Richard III'' to a 1930s [[fascism|fascist]] England in [[Ian McKellen]]'s [[Richard III (1995 film)|1995 film]], however, did not sit well with historians.  Adams posits that the original Shakespearian setting for Richard's fate at Bosworth teaches the moral of facing one's fate, no matter how unjust it is, &quot;nobly and with dignity&quot;.{{Sfn|Adams|2002|p=28}}  By overshadowing the dramatic teaching with special effects, McKellen's film reduces its version of the battle to a pyrotechnic spectacle about the death of a one-dimensional villain.{{Sfn|Adams|2002|pp=28&amp;ndash;29}}  Coursen agrees that, in this version, the battle and Richard's end are trite and underwhelming.{{Sfn|Coursen|2000|pp=102&amp;ndash;103}}

Officially the site of the battle is deemed by [[Leicestershire County Council]] to be in the vicinity of the town of [[Market Bosworth]].{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=1}}  The council engaged historian Daniel Williams to research the battle, and in 1974 his findings were used to build the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre and the presentation it houses.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}}  Williams's interpretation, however, has since been questioned. Sparked by the battle's quincentenary celebration in 1985,{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=1}} a dispute among historians has led many to suspect the accuracy of Williams's theory.{{Sfn|Dunn|2000|p=2}}{{Sfn|Battlefields Trust|2004|loc=&quot;[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/warsoftheroses/battlepageview.asp?pageid=387 Visiting the Battlefield]&quot;}}  In particular, geological surveys conducted from 2003 to 2009 by the Battlefields Trust, a charitable organisation that protects and studies old English battlefields, show that the southern and eastern flanks of Ambion Hill were solid ground in the 15th century, contrary to Williams's claim that it was a large area of marshland.{{Sfn|Foard|2004|p=21}} [[Landscape archaeology|Landscape archaeologist]] Glenn Foard, leader of the survey,{{Sfn|Williamson|2008|p=2}} said the collected soil samples and finds of mediaeval military equipment suggest that the battle took place two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of Ambion Hill (52°34′41″N 1°26′02″W),{{Sfn|Foard|2010|p=29}} contrary to the popular belief that it was fought near the foot of the hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wainwright|2009}}; {{Harvnb|Walker|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English Heritage argues that the battle was named after Market Bosworth because the town was the nearest significant settlement to the battlefield in the 15th century.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}} As explored by Professor Philip Morgan, a battle might initially be treated by society as an unremarkable event, deeming it of no memorable quality and therefore not requiring a name.  As time passes, writers of administrative and historical records find it necessary to identify the battle, ascribing it a name that is usually [[toponymy|toponymical]] in nature and sourced from combatants or observers.  This official name becomes accepted by society and future generations without question.{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|p=42}}  Early records associated the Battle of Bosworth Field with &quot;Brownehethe&quot;, &quot;''bellum Miravallenses''&quot;, &quot;Sandeford&quot; and &quot;Dadlyngton field&quot;.{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|p=44}}  The earliest record, a municipal memorandum of 23 August 1485 from York,{{Sfn|Foard|2004|p=17}} locates the battle &quot;on the field of Redemore&quot;.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=1&amp;ndash;2}}  This is corroborated by a 1485&amp;ndash;86 letter that mentions &quot;Redesmore&quot; as its site.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}}  According to historian Peter Foss, records did not associate the battle with &quot;Bosworth&quot; until 1510.{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|p=44}}

Foss is named by English Heritage as the principal advocate for &quot;Redemore&quot; as the battlesite.  He suggests the name is derived from &quot;''Hreod Mor''&quot;, an Anglo-Saxon phrase that means &quot;reedy marshland&quot;.  Basing his opinion on 13th- and 16th-century church records, he believes &quot;Redemore&quot; was an area of wetland that lay between Ambion Hill and the village of [[Dadlington]], and was close to the Fenn Lanes, a [[Roman roads|Roman road]] running east to west across the region.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}}  Foard believes this road to be the most probable route that both armies took to reach the battlefield.{{Sfn|Foard|2004|p=51}}  Williams dismisses the notion of &quot;Redmore&quot; as a specific location, calling the word a general term used to describe a large area of reddish soil;  Foss argues that Williams's sources are local stories and flawed interpretations of records.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=3}}  Moreover, he proposes that Williams was influenced by [[William Hutton (Birmingham historian)|William Hutton]]'s 1788 ''The Battle of Bosworth-Field'', which Foss blames for introducing the notion that the battle was fought west of Ambion Hill on the north side of the [[River Sence]].{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}}  Hutton, as Foss suggests, misinterpreted a passage from his source, [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s 1577 ''Chronicle''.  Holinshed wrote, &quot;King Richard pitched his field on a hill called Anne Beame, refreshed his soldiers and took his rest.&quot;  Foss believes that Hutton mistook &quot;field&quot; to mean &quot;field of battle&quot;, thus creating the idea that the fight took place on Anne Beame (Ambion) Hill.  To &quot;[pitch] his field&quot;, as Foss clarifies, was a period expression for setting up a camp.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=3}}

[[File:St James the Greater, Dadlington.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Side view of a building, which has a small tower on the left side: tombstones lie in rows on plots in front.|St James the Greater, Dadlington: the dead of Bosworth Field were buried here.]]
Foss brings further evidence for his &quot;Redemore&quot; theory by quoting [[Edward Hall]]'s 1550 ''Chronicle''.  Hall stated that Richard's army stepped onto a plain after breaking camp the next day.  Furthermore, historian [[William Burton (antiquary)|William Burton]], author of ''Description of Leicestershire'' (1622),{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=2}} wrote that the battle was &quot;fought in a large, flat, plaine, and spacious ground, three&amp;nbsp;miles [5&amp;nbsp;km] distant from [Bosworth], between the Towne of Shenton, Sutton [Cheney], Dadlington and Stoke [Golding]&quot;.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=3}}  In Foss's opinion both sources are describing an area of flat ground north of Dadlington.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}}

English Heritage, responsible for managing England's historic sites, used both theories to designate the site for Bosworth Field.  Without preference for either theory, they constructed a single continuous battlefield boundary that encompasses the locations proposed by both Williams and Foss.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|pp=12&amp;ndash;13}}  The region has experienced extensive changes over the years, starting after the battle.  Holinshed stated in his chronicle that he found firm ground where he expected the marsh to be, and Burton confirmed that by the end of the 16th century, areas of the battlefield were enclosed and had been [[Land improvement|improved]] to make them agriculturally productive.  Trees were planted on the south side of Ambion Hill, forming Ambion Wood.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[Ashby Canal]] carved through the land west and south-west of Ambion Hill.  Winding alongside the canal at a distance, the [[Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway]] crossed the area on an embankment.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}}{{Sfn|Gravett|1999|p=83}}  The changes to the landscape were so extensive that when Hutton revisited the region in 1807 after an earlier 1788 visit, he could not readily find his way around.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=4}}

[[File:King Richard's Well.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A pyramidal stone structure stands in a small clearing surrounded by small trees and bushes. The structure, enclosed by a fence, has an opening in the front.|Richard's Well, where the last Yorkist king supposedly took a drink of water on the day of the battle.]]
Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre was built on Ambion Hill, near Richard's Well.  According to legend, Richard III drank from one of the several springs in the region on the day of the battle.{{Sfn|Gravett|1999|p=72}}  In 1788, a local pointed out one of the springs to Hutton as the one mentioned in the legend.{{Sfn|Battlefields Trust|2004|loc=&quot;[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/warsoftheroses/battlepageview.asp?pageid=392 Battlefield Monuments]}}  A stone structure was later built over the location.  The inscription on the well reads:
{{quote|&quot;Near this spot, on August 22nd 1485, at the age of 32, King Richard III fell fighting gallantly in defence of his realm &amp; his crown against the usurper Henry Tudor.

The Cairn was erected by Dr. Samuel Parr in 1813 to mark the well from which the king is said to have drunk during the battle.

It is maintained by the Fellowship of the White Boar.&quot;{{Sfn|Battlefields Trust|2004|loc=&quot;[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/popup.asp?imageid=353 The Plaque on Richard's Well]&quot;}}}}
Northwest of Ambion Hill, just across the northern tributary of the Sence, a flag and memorial stone mark Richard's Field.  Erected in 1973, the site was selected on the basis of Williams's theory.{{Sfn|English Heritage|1995|p=12}}  St James's Church at Dadlington is the only structure in the area that is reliably associated with the Battle of Bosworth Field; the bodies of those killed in the battle were buried there.{{Sfn|Battlefields Trust|2004|loc=&quot;[http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/warsoftheroses/battlepageview.asp?pageid=392 Battlefield Monuments]}}

'''Brassicaceae''' or '''Cruciferae''', also known as the '''crucifers''', the '''mustard family''' or '''cabbage family''' is a [[Family (biology)|family]] of flowering plants ([[Angiosperms]]). The name Brassicaceae is derived from the included [[genus]] ''[[Brassica]]''. '''Cruciferae''' is an older name, meaning &quot;cross-bearing&quot;, because the four [[petal]]s of their flowers are reminiscent of a [[cross]]. According to [[ICBN]] Art. 18.5 (Vienna Code) both ''Cruciferae'' and ''Brassicaceae'' are regarded as validly published, and are thus accepted as names for the family.

It contains over 330 [[genus|genera]] and about 3,700 [[species]], according to the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]. The largest genera are ''[[Draba]]'' (365 species), ''[[Cardamine]]'' (200 species, but its definition is controversial), ''[[Erysimum]]'' (225 species), ''[[Lepidium]]'' (230 species) and ''[[Alyssum]]'' (195 species.)

The family contains well-known species such as ''[[Brassica oleracea]]'' (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, etc.), ''[[Brassica rapa]]'' (turnip, Chinese cabbage, etc.), ''[[Brassica napus]]'' (rapeseed, etc.), ''[[Raphanus sativus]]'' (common radish), ''[[Armoracia rusticana]]'' (horseradish), ''[[Matthiola]]'' (stock), ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' ([[model organism]]) and many others.

==Distribution==
The family is cosmopolitan, but is concentrated in the northern [[temperate]] regions and reaches maximal diversity around the [[Mediterranean area]].

==Taxonomy==
The family is included in [[order (biology)|Brassicales]] according to the [[APG system]]. Older systems (e.g. [[Cronquist system|Arthur Cronquist's]]) placed them into the [[Capparales]], a now defunct order which had a similar definition.

A close relationship has long been acknowledged between Brassicaceae and the [[caper]] family, [[Capparaceae]], in part because members of both groups produce [[glucosinolate]] (mustard oil) compounds. Recent research (Hall et al. 2002) suggests that Capparaceae as traditionally circumscribed are [[paraphyletic]] with respect to Brassicaceae, with ''[[Cleome]]'' and several related genera being more closely related to Brassicaceae than to other Capparaceae. The [[APG II]] system therefore has merged the two families under the name 'Brassicaceae'. Other classifications have continued to recognize Capparaceae but with a more restricted circumscription, either including ''Cleome'' and its relatives in Brassicaceae or recognizing them in the segregate family [[Cleomaceae]]. The [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/welcome.html angiosperm phylogeny website], has recently adopted this last solution, but this may change as a consensus arises on this point. This article deals with Brassicaceae ''sensu stricto'', i.e. treating Cleomaceae and Capparaceae as segregate families.

==Description==
[[Image:Purple rock cress.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Aubrieta deltoidea]]'' (commonly known as purple rock cress) is a perennial wild flower that is used in gardening for its ornamental large inflorescence]]
The family consists mostly of [[herbaceous]] plants with annual, biennial or perennial lifespans. However, around the Mediterranean they include also a dozen woody shrubs 1m - 3m tall, e.g. in northern Africa ''(Zilla spinosa'' and ''Ptilotrichum spinosum)'', in the Dalmatian islands ''(Dendralyssum'' and ''Cramboxylon)'', and chiefly in Canarias with some woody cruciferous genera: ''Dendrosinapis, Descurainia, Parolinia, Stanleya, etc.''. 

The '''[[leaf|leaves]]''' are [[phyllotaxis|alternate]] (rarely [[phyllotaxis|opposite]]), sometimes organized in basal [[rosette (botany)|rosette]]s; in rare shrubby crucifers of Mediterranean their leaves are mostly in terminal rosettes, and may be coriaceous and evergreen. They are very often pinnately incised and do not have [[stipule]]s.

The structure of the '''[[flower]]s''' is extremely uniform throughout the family. They have four free saccate [[sepal]]s and four clawed free [[petals]], staggered. They can be [[Floral symmetry|disymmetric]] or slightly [[Floral symmetry|zygomorphic]], with a typical cross-like arrangement (hence the name 'Cruciferae'). They have six [[stamen]]s, four of which are longer (as long as the petals, so relatively short in fact) and are arranged in a cross like the petals and the other two are shorter ('''tetradynamous''' flower). The [[pistil]] is made up of two fused [[carpel]]s and the style is very short, with two lobes. Superior ovary. The flowers form ebracteate [[Inflorescence#Simple_inflorescences|racemose]] inflorescences, often apically corymb-like.

[[Pollination]] occurs by [[entomogamy]], nectar is produced at the base of the stamens and stored on the sepals.

[[Image:Cardamine.impatiens.pods.jpg|thumb|Siliquae of ''[[Cardamine impatiens]]'']]
The '''[[fruit]]''' is a peculiar kind of [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] named '''siliqua''' (plural siliquae, American English silique/siliques). It opens by two valves, which are the modified carpels, leaving the [[seed]]s attached to a framework made up of the placenta and tissue from the junction between the valves ('''replum'''). There is often an indehiscent beak at the top of the style and one or more [[seeds]] may be borne there. Where a siliqua is less than three times as long as it is broad, it is usually termed a '''silicula'''. The siliqua may break apart at constrictions occurring between the segments of the seeds, thus forming a sort of [[loment]] (e.g. ''[[Raphanus]]''), it may eject the seeds explosively (e.g. ''[[Cardamine]]'') or may be evolved in a sort of [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] (e.g. ''[[Isatis]]''). Unsurprisingly the fruit is often the most important diagnostic character for plants in this family. 

The Brassicaceae do not form [[mycorrhizae]], although rare exceptions do exist.

Most members share a suite of glucosinolate compounds that has a typical pungent odour usually associated with cole crops.

==Uses==
[[Image:LunariaAnnua1.jpg|thumb|''[[Lunaria annua]]'']]
The importance of this family for '''food crops''' has led to its selective breeding throughout history. Some examples of cruciferous food plants are the [[cabbage]], [[broccoli]], [[cauliflower]], [[turnip]], [[rapeseed]], [[Mustard plant|mustard]], [[radish]], [[horseradish]], [[garden cress|cress]], [[wasabi]] and [[watercress]].
{{main|Cruciferous vegetables}}

''[[Matthiola]]'' (stock), ''[[Cheiranthus]]'', ''[[Alyssum]]'' and ''[[Iberis]]'' (candytufts) are appreciated for their flowers. ''[[Lunaria]]'' (honesty) is cultivated for the decorative value of the translucent repulum of the round silicula that remains on the dried stems after dehiscence. 

''[[Capsella bursa-pastoris]]'', ''[[Lepidium]]'' and many ''[[Cardamine]]'' are common weeds.

''[[Isatis tinctoria]]'' (woad) was used in the past to produce the colour [[indigo]].

''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is a very important [[model organism]] in the study of the flowering plants ([[Angiospermae]]).

{{Merge|Biblical canons|date=September 2010}}
The '''Books of the Bible''' are listed differently in the canons of [[Judaism]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]], Greek Orthodox, Slavonic Orthodox, Georgian, Armenian Apostolic, Syriac and Ethiopian churches, although there is substantial overlap. A table comparing the canons of some of these traditions appears below, comparing the Jewish Bible with the Christian [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]]. For a detailed discussion of the differences, see &quot;[[Biblical canon]]&quot;.

The [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books. The list given here for these churches is the most inclusive: if at least one Eastern church accepts the book it is included here.

==Old Testament, Tanakh, or Hebrew Bible==
{{See also|Development of the Jewish Bible canon|Development of the Old Testament canon}}
[[File:Development of the Old Testament.svg|thumb|right|350px|The books of the Old Testament, showing their positions in both the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible, shown with their names in Hebrew) and Christian Bibles. The [[Deuterocanon]] or [[biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] are colored differently from the [[Protocanon]] (the Hebrew Bible books which are considered canonical by all).]]

{{Books of the Old Testament}}
The disputed books are often called the [[Biblical apocrypha|Biblical ''apocrypha'']], a term that is sometimes used specifically (and possibly pejoratively in English) to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canons that are absent from the Jewish [[Masoretic Text]] (also called the [[Tanakh]] or ''Miqra'') and most modern [[Protestant]] Bibles. Catholic Christians, following the [[Canon of Trent]], describe these books as ''[[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]]'', meaning of &quot;the second canon,&quot; while Greek Orthodox Christians, following the [[Synod of Jerusalem (1672)]], use the traditional name of ''[[Biblical apocrypha#Anagignoskomena|anagignoskomena]]'', meaning &quot;that which is to be read.&quot; They are present in a few historic Protestant versions: the German [[Luther Bible]] included such books, as did the English 1611 [[King James Version]].&lt;ref name=&quot;39articles&quot;&gt;The foundational [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of [[Anglicanism]], in [[:s:Thirty-Nine Articles|Article VI]], asserts that these disputed books are not (to be) used &quot;to establish any doctrine,&quot; but &quot;read for example of life.&quot; Though the &quot;Biblical apocrypha&quot; are still used in [[Anglican Liturgy]], (&quot;Two of the hymns used in the American Prayer Book office of Morning Prayer, the Benedictus es and [[Benedicite]], are taken from the Apocrypha. One of the offertory sentences in Holy Communion comes from an apocryphal book (Tob. 4: 8-9). Lessons from the Apocrypha are regularly appointed to be read in the daily, Sunday, and special services of Morning and Evening Prayer. There are altogether 111 such lessons in the latest revised American Prayer Book Lectionary [The books used are: II Esdras, Tobit, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, Three Holy Children, and I Maccabees.]&quot; &amp;mdash;[http://orthodoxanglican.net/downloads/apocrypha.pdf The Apocrypha, Bridge of the Testaments]), the modern trend has been to not even print the Old Testament apocrypha in editions of Anglican-used Bibles, the last English translation for the Biblical Apocrypha being the [[Revised Standard Version]] of 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that this table uses current spellings of the [[New American Bible|NAB]]. Spellings of the 1609-1610 [[Douay-Rheims Bible]] describing the Catholic biblical canon were translated differently but the same books. In the spirit of ecumenism more recent Catholic translations, such as the 1970 use similar or identical spellings (e.g. 1 Chronicles) as Protestant Bibles in those books which are jointly considered canonical, i.e. the [[Protocanonical books|protocanonicals]]. The Talmud in Bava Batra 14b gives a different order for the books in Nevi'im and Ketuvim. This order is also quoted in Mishneh Torah Hilchot Sefer Torah 7:15. It is not clear why the present order of the books in the Tanakh doesn't match the order given in the Talmud.

Empty table cells indicate that a book is absent from that canon.

The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] has a few additional books in its canon: [[Jubilees]], [[Book of Enoch]], [[4 Baruch]] along with three books of [[Meqabyan]] that are unique to their canon.

The [[Third Epistle to the Corinthians]] and the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]] were once considered part of the [[Armenian Orthodox]] Bible, but are no longer printed with modern editions.

The New Testament has different orders in the Slavonic, Ethiopian, Syriac,&lt;ref group=N name=Peshitta/&gt; and Armenian traditions. Protestant Bibles in Russia and Ethiopia usually follow the local Orthodox order for the New Testament.

==Apocryphal or Deuterocanonical books==
These are the [[Biblical Apocrypha]]; books recognized by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox &amp; Oriental Orthodox Churches as being part of scripture (and thus [[deuterocanonical]] rather than apocryphal), but most Protestants do not recognize them except as part of The Apocrypha. Many other Christians recognize them as good, but not on the level of the other books of the Bible.

'''Statistics''' play an important role in summarizing [[baseball]] performance and evaluating players in the [[sport]].

Since the flow of a baseball game has natural breaks to it, the sport lends itself to easy record-keeping and [[statistics]]. Statistics have been kept for [[professional baseball]] since the creation of the [[American League]] and [[National League]], now part of [[Major League Baseball]].

Many statistics are also available from outside of Major League Baseball, from [[sports league|leagues]] such as the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] and the [[Negro League]]s.

== Development of statistics ==
The practice of keeping [[document|records]] of player achievements was started in the 19th century by [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on his experience with [[cricket]], Chadwick devised the predecessors to modern day [[statistics]] including [[Batting average#Baseball|batting average]], [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored, and [[Earned run|runs allowed]].

Traditionally, statistics such as batting average (the number of hits divided by the number of at bats) and earned run average (approximately the number of runs allowed by a pitcher per nine innings) have dominated attention in the statistical world of baseball. However, the recent advent of [[sabermetrics]] has created statistics drawing from a breadth of player performance measures and playing field variables. Sabermetrics and comparative statistics attempt to provide an improved measure of a player's performance and contributions to his team from year to year, frequently against a statistical performance average.

Comprehensive, historical baseball statistics were difficult for the average fan to access until 1951, when researcher [[Hy Turkin]] published ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Baseball''. In 1969, [[Macmillan Publishing]] printed its first ''[[Baseball Encyclopedia]]'', using a [[computer]] to compile statistics for the first time. Known as &quot;Big Mac&quot;, the encyclopedia became the standard baseball reference until 1988, when ''[[Total Baseball]]'' was released by Warner Books using more sophisticated technology. The publication of ''Total Baseball'' led to the discovery of several &quot;phantom ballplayers&quot;, including [[Lou Proctor]], who did not belong in official record books and were removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of statistics ==
Throughout much of modern baseball, several core statistics have been traditionally referenced—[[Batting average#Baseball|batting average]], [[Run batted in|RBIs]], and [[home run]]s. To this day, a player who leads the league in these three statistics is referred to as the &quot;[[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]]&quot; winner. For pitchers, [[Win (baseball)|wins]], [[Earned run average|ERA]], and [[strikeouts]] are the most often cited traditional statistics, with a pitcher leading a league in these statistics referred to as a &quot;Triple Crown&quot; winner.  General managers and [[scout (sport)|baseball scouts]] have long used the major statistics, among other factors and opinions, to understand player ability. Managers, catchers and pitchers use statistics of batters against opposing teams to develop pitching strategies and set [[baseball positioning|defensive positioning]] on the field. Managers and batters study opposing pitcher performance and motion in attempts to improve hitting.

Some [[sabermetric]] statistics have entered the mainstream baseball world that measure a batter's overall performance including [[On-base plus slugging]], commonly referred to as OPS. OPS adds the hitter's [[on base percentage]] (number of times reached base by any means divided by total plate appearances) to his [[slugging percentage]] ([[total bases]] divided by at bats).  Some argue that the OPS formula is flawed and that more weight should be shifted towards OBP (on base percentage).&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot;/&gt;

OPS is also useful when determining a pitcher's level of success. &quot;Opponent On-base Plus Slugging&quot; (OOPS) is becoming a popular way to evaluate a pitcher's actual performance.  When analyzing a pitcher's statistics, some useful categories to consider include [[K/9IP]] (strikeouts per nine innings), [[Strikeout-to-walk ratio|K/BB]] (strikeouts per walk), HR/9, WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched) and OOPS (opponent on-base plus slugging).

However, since 2001, more emphasis has been placed on [[Defense independent pitching statistics|Defense-Independent Pitching Statistics]], including Defense-Independent ERA (dERA), in an attempt to evaluate a pitcher performance regardless of the strength of the defensive players behind him.

Also important are all of the above statistics in certain in-game situations. For example, a certain hitter's ability to hit left-handed pitchers might incline a manager to provide increased opportunities to face left-handed pitchers. Other hitters may have a history of success against a given pitcher (or vice versa), and the manager may use this information to create a favorable
match-up. Broadcast commentators often refer to this as &quot;playing the percentages&quot;.

{{Cleanup-rewrite|date=November 2009}}

[[Image:Ichiro Suzuki bottom of the 3rd inning July 6 2009.JPG|right|350px]]
In [[baseball]], an '''at bat''' ('''AB''') or '''time at bat''' is used to calculate certain [[baseball statistics|statistics]], including [[batting average]], [[on base percentage]], and [[slugging percentage]]. It is a more restricted definition of a [[plate appearance]]. A [[batter (baseball)|batter]] starts with an at bat every time he faces a [[pitcher]]; however, the batter gets &quot;no time at bat&quot; in the following circumstances:
* He receives a [[base on balls]] (BB).&lt;ref&gt;In [[1887 in baseball|1887]], [[Major League Baseball]] counted bases on balls as [[hit (baseball)|hits]]. The result was high [[batting average]]s, including some near .500, and the experiment was abandoned the following season.&lt;/ref&gt;
* He is [[hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]] (HBP).
* He hits a [[sacrifice fly]] or a [[sacrifice hit]] (also known as sacrifice bunt).
* He is awarded [[Baseball field#First base|first base]] due to interference or obstruction, usually by the [[catcher]].
* The [[inning]] ends while he is still at bat (due to the third [[out (baseball)|out]] being made by a runner [[caught stealing]], for example). In this case, the batter will come to bat again in the next inning, though he now has no balls or strikes on him.
* He is replaced by another hitter before his at bat is completed (unless he is replaced with two strikes and his replacement strikes out).

Section 10.02.a.1 of the official rules of [[Major League Baseball]] defines an at bat as:
&quot;Number of times batted, except that no time at bat shall be charged when a player: (1) hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly; (2) is awarded first base on four called balls; (3) is hit by a pitched ball; or (4) is awarded first base because of interference or obstruction...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MLBatbat&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

  | work = Official Baseball Rules
  | format = PDF
  | publisher = Commissioner of Baseball, [[Major League Baseball]]
  | accessdate = 2010-03-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
An at bat is counted when:
*The batter reaches first base on a [[Hit (baseball statistics)|hit]]
*The batter reaches first base on an [[Error (baseball statistics)|error]]
*The batter is called [[Out (baseball)|out]] for any reason other than as part of a sacrifice
*There is a [[fielder's choice]]

==At bat as a phrase==
&quot;At bat&quot;, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;up at bat&quot;, and &quot;at the plate&quot; are all phrases describing a batter who is facing the pitcher. Note that just because a player is described as being &quot;at bat&quot; in this sense, he will not necessarily be given an at bat in his statistics; the phrase actually signifies a [[plate appearance]] (assuming it is eventually completed). This ambiguous terminology is usually clarified by context. To refer explicitly to the technical meaning of &quot;at bat&quot; described above, the term &quot;official at bat&quot; is sometimes used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[baseball]], an '''earned run''' is any [[Run (baseball)|run]] for which the [[pitcher]] is held accountable (i.e., the run scored as a result of normal pitching, and not due to a fielding [[error (baseball statistics)|error]] or a [[passed ball]]).  Any runner(s) who tags his base and reaches home plate is scored against the pitcher as an '''earned run(s)'''.  An error made by the pitcher in fielding at his position is counted the same as an error by any other player.

Earned runs are specially denoted because of their use in calculating a pitcher's [[earned run average]] – the number of earned runs allowed per 9 innings (regulation game) pitched.  Earned runs proceed from the theory that the pitcher has sole responsibility to earn strikes against opposing batter(s) until at least three batters are retired in each inning of play, and nine innings (a complete game) are pitched.

To determine whether a run is earned, the [[official scorer]] must reconstruct the [[innings|inning]] as it would have occurred without the errors (for purposes of this rule, the &quot;errors&quot; also include passed balls).  The benefit of the doubt is always given to the pitcher in determining which bases would have been reached by errorless play.

If no errors and no passed balls occur during the inning, all runs scored are automatically earned (assigned responsible to the pitcher).  In a few cases, an error can be rendered harmless while the inning is still going on.  For example, a runner on first base advances to second on a passed ball.  The next batter walks.  Since the runner would now have been at second anyway, the passed ball no longer has any impact on the earned/unearned calculation.

== Unearned run ==
A run is counted as unearned when:

* A batter reaches base on an error (including catcher's interference), and later scores a run in that inning by any means.
* A baserunner remains on base as the result of an error on a fielder's choice play that would put the baserunner out except for the error, and subsequently scores.
* A batter reaches first base on a [[passed ball]] (but not a [[wild pitch]]) and subsequently scores by any means.
* A baserunner scores after the third out would have been made except for an error other than catcher's interference.
* A batter reaches base on a [[fielder's choice]] which removes a baserunner who has reached base safely on an error or has remained on base as the result of an error, reaching first base on a passed ball on a called or swinging third strike, or remained on base on an error on a fielders' choice play that should have retired him, and subsequently scores.
* A batter or runner advances one or more bases on an error or passed ball and scores on a play that would otherwise not have provided the opportunity to score.

In the first two cases above, &quot;on an error&quot; includes situations where the batter makes a clean hit (or walks, is hit by pitch, reaches base on a fielder's choice in which no out is made, or reaches base on a wild pitch on a called or swinging third strike), but should have been out earlier in his at bat on a foul fly ball which was dropped by a fielder for an error. This also includes any run (or any subsequent run) that scores on plays that result in outs with one out or a double play with none out if an error has extended the inning.

While the inning is still being played, this last scenario can cause a temporary situation where a run has already scored, but its earned/unearned status is not yet certain.  For example, with two outs, a runner on [[third baseman|third base]] scores on a passed ball.  For the time being, the run is unearned since the runner ''should'' still be at third.  If the batter [[strikeout|strikes out]] to end the inning, it will stay that way.  If the batter gets a [[base hit]], which would have scored the runner anyway, the run now becomes earned.

A runner who reaches on [[catcher's interference]] and subsequently scores with two outs scores an unearned run, but baserunners who subsequently score after the runner who has reached on catcher's interference exclusively on clean plays score earned runs; the baserunner  cannot be assumed to have been put out except for the error. (Rule 10.16(4)).

Neither the use of a [[pinch-runner]] to replace a baserunner who represents an unearned run nor the use of a [[pinch-hitter]] to continue the turn at bat of a batter who would be out except for an error transforms a run scored by such a person or his successors on base from an unearned run to an earned run.

When pitchers are changed in the middle of an inning, and one or more errors have already occurred, it is possible to have a run charged as earned against a specific pitcher, but unearned to the team.  The simplest example is when the defensive team records two outs and makes an error on a play that would have been the third out.  A new pitcher comes into the game, and the next batter hits a [[home run]].  The runner who reached on the error comes around to score, and his run is unearned to both the prior pitcher and the team.  However, the run scored by the batter is counted as earned against the relief pitcher, but unearned to the team (since there should have already been three outs).  Had the team not switched pitchers, neither run would be counted as an earned run because that pitcher should have already been out of that inning.

A pitcher is only charged with the number of runners that reached base while he was pitching, and this does not include baserunners who reach base as the result of a fielder's choice play that removes an existing runner; such a runner is charged to the pitcher whose baserunner has been removed by the fielder's choice play.  When a pitching change occurs, the new pitcher is said to &quot;[[List of baseball jargon (I)#inherited runner|inherit]]&quot; any runners that are on base at the time, and if they later score, those runs are charged (earned or unearned) to the prior pitcher.  Most [[box score (baseball)|box scores]] now list inherited runners, and the number that scored, as a statistic for the relief pitcher.

==Historical differences==
In the early history of major league baseball, the difference between the number of earned runs given up by a pitcher and the total number of runs given up was much more significant than today.  For instance, [[Jim Devlin]] in [[1876 in baseball|1876]] pitched 66 [[complete game]]s (662 innings pitched) with a 1.56 ERA but managed to record only five [[shutout]]s.  The seeming discrepancy comes from the difference in the number of allowed runs (309) versus earned runs (108).

A '''base on balls''' ('''BB''') is credited to a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] and against a [[pitcher]] in [[baseball statistics]] when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls [[strike zone|''balls'']]. It is better known as a '''walk'''. The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball's Official Rules,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/definition_terms_2.jsp rule 2.00 &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and further detail is given in 6.08(a).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp rule 6.00&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is called a &quot;walk&quot; because the batter is then entitled to walk to first base, or more specifically (as defined in the rules of baseball) he is &quot;entitled to first base without liability to be put out.&quot; However, the term &quot;base on balls&quot; is used in official context because it is considered a [[faux pas]] for a [[professional baseball|professional]] player to walk to first base (as opposed to physically running), and also to distinguish from the other manners in which a batter can be awarded first base without liability to be put out (e.g., [[hit by pitch]], [[catcher's interference]]).

A batter who draws a base on balls is commonly said to have been &quot;walked&quot; by the pitcher. When the batter is walked, runners advance one base without liability to be put out only if forced to vacate their base to allow the batter to take first base. If a batter draws a walk with the [[bases loaded]], all preceding runners are forced to advance, including the runner on third base who is forced to home plate to score a run, and the batter is credited with an [[RBI]] per rule 10.04.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp rule 10.00 &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Receiving a base on balls does not count as a [[hit (baseball)|hit]] or an [[at bat]] for a batter but does count as a [[times on base|time on base]] and a [[plate appearance]]. Therefore, a base on balls does not increase nor decrease a player's [[batting average]], but it does increase his [[on-base percentage]], unless a player's on-base percentage is 1.000, in which it remains the same.&lt;ref&gt;In [[1887 in baseball|1887]], [[Major League Baseball]] counted bases on balls as [[Hit (baseball)|hits]].  The result was skyrocketed [[batting average]]s, including some near .500, and the experiment was abandoned the following season. Current record books do not count walks in 1887 as hits.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[hit by pitch]] is not counted statistically as a walk, though the effect is mostly the same, with the batter receiving a free pass to first base.  The one exception is that on a HBP, the ball is dead and any runners who were stealing on the play must return to their original base unless forced to the next base anyways.

==Intentional base on balls==
{{main|Intentional base on balls}}
A subset of the base on balls, an '''intentional base on balls''' ('''IBB''') or '''intentional walk''' is when the pitcher deliberately pitches the ball away from the batter in order to issue a base on balls. As with any other walk, an intentional walk entitles the batter to first base without liability to be put out, and entitles any runners to advance if forced. Intentional walks are a strategic defensive maneuver, usually done to bypass one hitter for one the defensive team believes is less likely to initiate a run-scoring play (e.g., a [[home run]], [[sacrifice fly]], or [[RBI]] [[hit (baseball)|base hit]]), or to set up a [[double play]] or [[force play|force out]] situation for the next batter. They do carry an inherent risk, however, as they give the offensive team another runner on base, without any effort on their part, who could potentially score a run.

[[Image:Escobar IBB.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mark Hendrickson]] of the [[Florida Marlins]] intentionally walking the [[Atlanta Braves]]' [[Yunel Escobar]] in 2008. Note the Florida [[catcher]], [[Mike Rabelo]], in a standing position behind the opposite batter's box to receive the pitch]]

An intentional walk is signaled by the catcher standing and extending one arm to the side away from the batter. The pitcher then pitches the ball to that side several feet outside from home plate, usually outside the reach of the batter. A ball pitched in this manner is called an '''intentional ball''' and counts as a ball in the pitcher's [[pitch count]]. In order to count as an intentional ball, the ball must be legally pitched, i.e., the pitcher's foot must be on the [[baseball field#Pitcher's mound|pitcher's rubber]], the catcher must be in the [[baseball field#Batter's box and catcher's box|catcher's box]], and the batter must be in the [[baseball field#Batter's box and catcher's box|batter's box]] appearing ready to take a pitch at the time the ball is thrown. An intentional walk may be signaled at any time during the batter's turn at the plate; in these cases only enough additional intentional balls need to be thrown to bring the total to four. Only walks issued by the catcher signaling as described above are recorded as intentional walks (see below); walks issued without the catcher signaling – even if the pitches ''are'' intentionally thrown outside of the strike zone – are not recorded as intentional.

Another risk taken by the defensive team in issuing a base on balls is that since intentional balls must be pitched in a legal manner, they can legally become [[wild pitch]]es or [[passed ball]]s. Likewise, a baserunner can attempt to [[stolen base|steal]] a base, or the batter can choose to swing at an intentional ball; however, these rarely occur since taking these risks is rarely more beneficial to the offensive team than allowing the walk. In the Major Leagues, the most recent example of a swing at an intentional ball resulting in a hit occurred during a June 22, 2006 game between the [[Florida Marlins]] and the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. In the top of the 10th inning, with a runner on second base, Baltimore pitcher [[Todd Williams]] was signaled to intentionally walk the Marlins' [[Miguel Cabrera]]. Noticing that the intentional ball came in too close to the plate, Cabrera swung at the ball, resulting in a b
