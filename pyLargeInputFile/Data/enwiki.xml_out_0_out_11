===Churchmanship===
[[File:Tridentine mass.jpg|right|thumb|An eastward-facing [[Solemn High Mass]], a [[Catholic]] liturgical phenomenon which re-emerged in Anglicanism following the [[Oxford Movement|Catholic Revival]] of the nineteenth century.]]

&quot;Churchmanship&quot; can be defined as the manifestation of theology in the realms of liturgy, piety and, to some extent, spirituality. Anglican diversity in this respect has tended to reflect the diversity in the tradition's Reformed and Catholic identity. Different individuals, groups, parishes, dioceses and provinces may identify more closely with one or the other, or some mixture of the two.

The range of Anglican belief and practice became particularly divisive during the 19th century when some clergy were disciplined and even imprisoned on charges of [[ritual heresy]] while, at the same time, others were criticised for engaging in public worship services with ministers of Reformed churches. Resistance to the growing acceptance and restoration of traditional Catholic ceremonial by the mainstream of Anglicanism ultimately led to the formation of small breakaway churches such as the [[Free Church of England]] in England (1844) and the [[Reformed Episcopal Church]] in North America (1873).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcofe.org.uk/about_the_free_church_of_england.htm Accessed 9 November 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rechurch.org/recus/?MIval=/recweb/foundations.html&amp;display=overview Accessed 9 November 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anglo-Catholic]] (and some Broad Church) Anglicans celebrate public liturgy in ways that understand worship to be something very special and of utmost importance. [[Vestments]] are worn by the clergy, sung settings are often used and [[incense]] may be used. Nowadays, in most Anglican churches, the Eucharist is celebrated in a manner similar to the usage of Roman Catholics and some Lutherans though, in many churches, more traditional, &quot;pre-Vatican II&quot;, models of worship are common, (e.g. an &quot;eastward orientation&quot; at the altar). Whilst many Anglo-Catholics derive much of their liturgical practice from that of the pre-Reformation English church, others more closely follow traditional Roman Catholic practices. The Eucharist may be sometimes be celebrated, in the form known as [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]], with a priest, deacon and [[subdeacon]] dressed in traditional vestments, with incense and [[sanctus bell]]s and with prayers adapted from the Roman [[missal]] or other sources by the celebrant. Such churches may also have forms of [[Eucharistic adoration]] such as Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. In terms of personal piety some Anglicans may recite the [[Anglican Rosary|rosary]] and [[angelus]], be involved in a devotional society dedicated to &quot;Our Lady&quot; (the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]) and seek the intercession of the saints.

In recent years the prayer books of several provinces have, out of deference to a greater agreement with Eastern [[Conciliarism]] (and a perceived greater respect accorded Anglicanism by Eastern Orthodoxy than by Roman Catholicism), instituted a number of historically Eastern and [[Oriental Orthodox]] elements in their liturgies, including introduction of the [[Trisagion]] and deletion of the [[filioque]] clause from the [[Nicene Creed]].

For their part, those [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] (and some Broad Church) Anglicans who emphasise the more Protestant aspects of the Church stress the Reformation theme of [[Salvation#Christian views of salvation|salvation]] by grace through faith. They emphasise the two dominical sacraments of Baptism and Eucharist, viewing the other five as &quot;lesser rites&quot;. Some Evangelical Anglicans may even tend to take the inerrancy of Scripture literally, adopting the view of Article VI that it contains all things necessary to salvation in an explicit sense. Worship in churches influenced by these principles tends to be significantly less elaborate, with greater emphasis on the [[Liturgy of the Word]] (the reading of the scriptures, the sermon and the intercessory prayers). The Order for Holy Communion may be celebrated bi-weekly or monthly (in preference to the [[daily office]]s), by priests attired in [[choir habit]], or more regular clothes, rather than Eucharistic vestments. Ceremony may be in keeping with their view of the provisions of the 17th century Puritans – being a [[Reformed]] interpretation of the [[Ornaments Rubric]] – no candles, no incense, no bells and a minimum of manual actions by the presiding celebrant (such as touching the elements at the [[Words of Institution]]).

In recent decades there has been a growth of [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] worship among Anglicans. Both Anglo-Catholics and Evangelicals have been affected by this movement such that it is not uncommon to find typically charismatic postures, music, and other themes evident during the services of otherwise Anglo-Catholic or Evangelical parishes.

The spectrum of Anglican beliefs and practice is too large to be fit into these labels. Many Anglicans locate themselves somewhere in the spectrum of the Broad Church tradition and consider themselves an amalgam of Evangelical and Catholic. Such Anglicans stress that Anglicanism is the &quot;''[[via media]]''&quot; (middle way) between the two major strains of Western Christianity and that Anglicanism is like a &quot;bridge&quot; between the two strains.

===Sacramental doctrine and practice===
{{Main|Anglican sacraments}}

As befits its prevailing self-identity as a ''[[via media]]'' or &quot;middle path&quot; of [[Western Christianity]], Anglican sacramental theology expresses elements in keeping with its status as being both a church in the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] tradition as well as a church of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]]. With respect to sacramental theology the Catholic heritage is perhaps most strongly asserted in the importance Anglicanism places on the [[sacrament]]s as a means of [[Divine grace|grace]], [[sanctification]] and [[salvation]] as expressed in the church's [[liturgy]] and doctrine.

Of the seven sacraments, Anglicans recognise [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist|Holy Eucharist]] as being directly instituted by Christ. The other five— [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession and absolution]], [[Christian view of marriage|Holy Matrimony]], [[Confirmation (sacrament)|Confirmation]], [[Holy Orders]] (also called Ordination), and [[Anointing of the Sick]] (also called Unction)— are regarded variously as full sacraments by [[Anglo-Catholic]]s, many [[High Church]], and some [[Broad Church]] Anglicans, but merely as &quot;sacramental rites&quot; by other Broad Church and [[Low Church]] Anglicans, and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]], such as [[Reform (Anglican)|Reform UK]] and the [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney|Diocese of Sydney]].

====Eucharistic theology====
{{Main|Anglican Eucharistic theology}}

Anglican Eucharistic theology is divergent in practice, reflecting the essential comprehensiveness of the tradition. Some Low Church Anglicans take a strictly memorialist ([[Zwingli]]an) view of the sacrament. In other words, they see Holy Communion as a memorial to Christ's suffering, and participation in the Eucharist as both a re-enactment of the Last Supper and a foreshadowing of the heavenly banquet – the fulfilment of the Eucharistic promise. Other Low Church Anglicans believe in the [[Real Presence]] but deny that the presence of Christ is carnal or is necessarily localised in the bread and wine. Despite explicit criticism in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], many High Church or Anglo-Catholic Anglicans hold, more or less, the Roman Catholic view of the Real Presence, as expressed in the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]], seeing the Eucharist as a liturgical representation of Christ's atoning sacrifice with the elements actually transformed into Christ's Body and Blood.

Most Anglicans, however, implicitly or explicitly adopt the eucharistic theology of [[consubstantiation]], first articulated by the Lollards, or &quot;Sacramental Union&quot; first articulated by Martin Luther.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Luther's analogy of Christ's presence was that of the heat of a horseshoe thrust into a fire until it is glowing. In the same way, Christ is present in the bread and the wine. Some{{Who|date=September 2010}} though see it as an unknowable and describe it as a [[holy mystery]].

The classical Anglican aphorism regarding Christ's presence in the sacrament is found in a poem by [[John Donne]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:He was the Word that spake it;
:He took the bread and brake it;
:and what that Word did make it;
:I do believe and take it.&lt;ref&gt;Donne, John. Divine Poems – On the Sacrament, (Flesher's Edition) http://www.giga-usa.com/quotes/topics/doctrine_t001.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An Anglican position on the eucharistic sacrifice (&quot;Sacrifice of the Mass&quot;) was expressed in the response ''[[Saepius Officio]]'' of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s Papal Encyclical ''[[Apostolicae curae]]''.

Anglican and Roman Catholic representatives declared that they had &quot;substantial agreement on the doctrine of the Eucharist&quot; in the [http://www.prounione.urbe.it/dia-int/arcic/doc/e_arcic_Eucharist.html Windsor Statement on Eucharistic Doctrine from the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Consultation]{{dead link|date=December 2010}} and the [http://www.prounione.urbe.it/dia-int/arcic/doc/e_arcic_elucid_euch.html Elucidation of the ARCIC Windsor Statement]. Despite this agreement, other ecclesiological differences between the two churches prevent full intercommunion.

In Anglicanism there is a distinction between liturgy, which is the formal public and communal worship of the Church, and personal prayer and devotion which may be public or private. Liturgy is regulated by the prayer books and consists of the Holy Eucharist (some call it Holy Communion or Mass), the other six Sacraments, and the Divine Office or Liturgy of the Hours.

===Book of Common Prayer===
[[File:Book of common prayer 1596.jpg|left|thumb|The 1596 Book of Common Prayer]]
The ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (BCP) is the foundational prayer book of Anglicanism. The original book of 1549 (revised 1552) was one of the instruments of the [[English Reformation]], replacing the various 'uses' or rites in Latin that had been used in different parts of the country with a single compact volume in the language of the people, so that &quot;now from henceforth all the Realm shall have but one use&quot;. Suppressed under Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], it was revised in 1559, and then again in 1662, after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. This version was made mandatory in England and Wales by the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]] and was in standard use until the mid 20th century.

With [[British Empire|British colonial]] expansion from the 17th century onwards, the Anglican church was planted around the globe. These churches at first used and then revised the Book of Common Prayer, until they, like their parent church, produced prayer books which took into account the developments in liturgical study and practice in the 19th and 20th centuries, which come under the general heading of the [[Liturgical Movement]].

===Worship===
{{See also|Church of England parish church}}

Anglican worship services are open to all visitors. Anglican worship originates principally in the reforms of [[Thomas Cranmer]], who aimed to create a set order of service like that of the pre-Reformation church but less complex in its seasonal variety and said in English rather than [[Latin]]. This use of a set order of service is not unlike the Roman Catholic tradition. Traditionally the pattern was that laid out in the [[Book of Common Prayer]]. Although many Anglican churches now use a wide range of modern service books written in the local language, the structures of the Book of Common Prayer are largely retained. Churches which call themselves Anglican will have identified themselves so because they use some form or variant of the Book of Common Prayer in the shaping of their worship.

Anglican worship, however, is as diverse as Anglican theology. A contemporary &quot;[[low church]]&quot; or Evangelical service may differ little from the worship of many mainstream Protestant churches. The service is constructed around a sermon focused on Biblical exposition and opened with one or more Bible readings and closed by a series of prayers (both set and extemporised) and hymns or songs. A &quot;[[high church]]&quot; or Anglo-Catholic service, by contrast, is usually a more formal [[liturgy]] celebrated by clergy in distinctive [[vestments]] and may be almost indistinguishable from a Roman Catholic service, often resembling the &quot;pre-Vatican II&quot; [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine rite]]. Between these extremes are a variety of styles of worship, often involving a robed choir and the use of the organ to accompany the singing and to provide music before and after the service. Anglican churches tend to have [[pew]]s or chairs and it is usual for the congregation to kneel for some prayers but to stand for hymns and other parts of the service such as the Gloria, Collect, Gospel reading, Creed and either the Preface or all of the Eucharistic Prayer. High Anglicans may genuflect or cross themselves in the same way as Roman Catholics.

Until the mid-20th century the main Sunday service was typically [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|morning prayer]], but the [[Eucharist]] has once again become the standard form of Sunday worship in many Anglican churches; this again is similar to Roman Catholic practice. Other common Sunday services include an early morning Eucharist without music, an abbreviated Eucharist following a service of morning prayer and a service of [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|evening prayer]], sometimes in the form of sung [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]], usually celebrated between 3 and 6&amp;nbsp;pm The late-evening service of [[Compline]] was revived in parish use in the early 20th century. Many Anglican churches will also have daily morning and evening prayer and some have midweek or even daily celebration of the Eucharist.

An Anglican service (whether or not a Eucharist) will include readings from the Bible that are generally taken from a standardised [[lectionary]], which provides for much of the Bible (and some passages from the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]]) to be read out loud in the church over a three year cycle. The [[sermon]] (or [[homily]]) is typically about ten to twenty minutes in length, though it may be much longer in Evangelical churches. Even in the most informal Evangelical services it is common for set prayers such as the weekly [[Collect]] to be read. There are also set forms for [[intercessory prayer]], though this is now more often extemporaneous. In high and Anglo-Catholic churches there are generally prayers for the dead.

Although Anglican public worship is usually ordered according to the canonically approved services, in practice many Anglican churches use forms of service outside these norms. Many Evangelical churches sit lightly to the set forms of morning and evening prayer, though generally respecting the canonical order of Holy Communion. Liberal churches may use freely structured or experimental forms of worship, including patterns borrowed from ecumenical traditions such as those of [[Taizé Community]] or the [[Iona Community]].

[[Anglo-Catholic]] parishes might use the modern Roman Catholic liturgy of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or more traditional forms, such as the [[Tridentine Mass]] (which is translated into English in the [[English Missal]]), the [[Anglican Missal]], or, less commonly, the [[Sarum Rite]]. Traditional Catholic devotions such as the [[Rosary]], [[Angelus]] and [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]] are also common among Anglo-Catholics.

====Eucharistic discipline====
Only [[Baptism|baptised]] persons are eligible to receive communion,&lt;ref name=&quot;communion&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gc2006.org/?id=368&amp;type=CURRENT |publisher=ECUSA |title=Upholding Communion of the Baptized |date=22 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in many churches communion is restricted to those who have not only been baptised but also [[Confirmation|confirmed]]. In many Anglican provinces, however, all baptised Christians are now often invited to receive communion and some dioceses have regularised a system for admitting baptised young people to communion before they are confirmed.

The discipline of fasting before communion is practised by some Anglicans. Most Anglican priests require the presence of at least one other person for the celebration of the Eucharist (referring back to Christ's statement in Math 18:20 &quot;When two or more are gathered in my name, I will be in the midst of them&quot;), though some Anglo-Catholic priests (like Roman Catholic priests) may say private Masses. As in the Roman Catholic Church, it is a canonical requirement to use fermented [[wine]] for the Communion; unlike in mainstream Roman Catholicism, however, the consecrated bread and wine are always offered together to the congregation in a Eucharistic service (&quot;Communion in Both Kinds&quot;). This practice is gradually being adopted in the Roman Catholic Church too, especially through the [[Neocatechumenal Way]]. In some churches the sacrament is reserved in a tabernacle or [[aumbry]] with a lighted candle or lamp nearby. Only a priest or a bishop may be the celebrant at the Eucharist, though [[Sydney Anglican]]s may soon authorise lay people to celebrate the Eucharist (or Lord's Supper).

===Divine office===
[[File:Evensong in York Minster.jpg|right|thumb|Evensong at [[York Minster]]]]
All Anglican prayer books contain offices for [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]] (Matins) and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] (Evensong). In the original Book of Common Prayer these were derived from combinations of the ancient monastic offices of [[Matins]] and [[Lauds]]; and [[Vespers]] and [[Compline]] respectively. The prayer offices have an important place in Anglican history. Prior to the [[Oxford Movement|Catholic revival]] of the 19th century, which eventually restored the [[Holy Eucharist]] as the principal Sunday liturgy, and especially during the 18th century, a morning service combining Matins, the [[Litany]] and ante-Communion comprised the usual expression of common worship; while Matins and Evensong were sung daily in cathedrals and some collegiate chapels. This nurtured a tradition of distinctive [[Anglican chant]] applied to the [[canticle]]s and [[psalm]]s used at the offices (although [[plainsong]] is often used as well).

In some official and many unofficial Anglican service books these offices are supplemented by other offices such as the [[Little Hours]] of [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]] and prayer during the day such as ([[Terce]], [[Sext]], [[None (liturgy)|None]] and [[Compline]]). Some Anglican monastic communities have a [[Daily Office]] based on that of the Book of Common Prayer but with additional antiphons and canticles, etc. for specific days of the week, specific psalms, etc. See, for example, [[Order of the Holy Cross]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holycrossmonastery.com/ Holy Cross Monastery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Order of St Helena, editors, ''A Monastic Breviary'' (Wilton, Conn.: Morehouse-Barlow, 1976). The All Saints Sisters of the Poor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/xnomad4/index.html]{{dead link|date=December 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2009|bot=WebCiteBOT}}&lt;/ref&gt; with convents in Catonsville, Maryland and elsewhere use an elaborated version of the Anglican Daily Office. The [[Society of St. Francis]] publishes Celebrating Common Prayer which has become especially popular for use among Anglicans.

In England, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and some other Anglican provinces the modern prayer books contain four offices:
* Morning Prayer, corresponding to Matins, Lauds and Prime.
* Prayer During the Day, roughly corresponding to the combination of Terce, Sext and None (Noonday Prayer in the USA)
* Evening Prayer, corresponding to Vespers (and Compline).
* Compline
In addition, most prayer books include a section of prayers and devotions for family use. In the US, these offices are further supplemented by an &quot;Order of Worship for the Evening&quot;, a prelude to or an abbreviated form of Evensong, partly derived from [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] prayers. In the United Kingdom, the publication of ''Daily Prayer'', the third volume of [[Common Worship]] was published in 2005. It retains the services for Morning and Evening Prayer and Compline and includes a section entitled &quot;Prayer during the Day&quot;. 'A New Zealand Prayer Book' of 1989 provides different outlines for Matins and Evensong on each day of the week, as well as &quot;Midday Prayer&quot;, &quot;Night Prayer&quot; and &quot;Family Prayer&quot;.

Some Anglicans who pray the office on daily basis use the present [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] of the Roman Catholic Church. In many cities, especially in England, Anglican and Roman Catholic priests and lay people often meet several times a week to pray the office in common. A small but enthusiastic minority use the [[Anglican Breviary]], or other translations and adaptations of the Pre-Vatican II Roman Rite and [[Sarum Rite]], along with supplemental material from cognate western sources, to provide such things as a common of Octaves, a common of Holy Women and other additional material. Others may privately use idiosyncratic forms borrowed from a wide range of Christian traditions.

==== &quot;Quires and Places where they sing&quot; ==== &lt;!-- Please do not &quot;correct&quot; the capitalisation or spelling as it is a direct quote --&gt;
{{Main|Anglican church music}}

In the late medieval period, many English cathedrals and monasteries had established small choirs of trained [[lay clerk]]s and boy [[choir|choristers]] to perform [[polyphony|polyphonic]] settings of the [[Mass (music)|Mass]] in their [[Lady Chapel]]s. Although these &quot;Lady Masses&quot; were discontinued at the Reformation, the associated musical tradition was maintained in the [[Elizabethan Settlement]] through the establishment of choral foundations for daily singing of the Divine Office by expanded choirs of men and boys. This resulted from an explicit addition by Elizabeth herself to the injunctions accompanying the 1559 [[Book of Common Prayer]] (that had itself made no mention of choral worship) by which existing choral foundations and choir schools were instructed to be continued, and their endowments secured. Consequently, some thirty-four cathedrals, collegiate churches and royal chapels maintained paid establishments of lay singing men and choristers in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mould |first=Alan |title=The English Chorister: A History |page=94 |isbn=1847250580 |year=2007 |publisher=Hambledon Continuum |location=London |oclc=71165225}}&lt;/ref&gt; All save four of these have – with an interruption during the [[English Interregnum|Commonwealth]] – continued daily choral prayer and praise to this day. In the Offices of [[Matins]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, these choral establishments are specified as &quot;Quires and Places where they sing&quot;.

For nearly three centuries, this round of daily professional choral worship represented a tradition entirely distinct from that embodied in the intoning of [[Parish Clerk]]s, and the singing of &quot;[[West gallery music|west gallery choirs]]&quot; which commonly accompanied weekly worship in English parish churches. However, in 1841, the rebuilt [[Leeds Parish Church]] established a surpliced [[choir]] to accompany parish services; drawing explicitly on the musical traditions of the ancient choral foundations; and over the next century, the Leeds example proved immensely popular and influential for choirs in cathedrals, parish churches and schools throughout the Anglican communion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mould |first=Alan |title=The English Chorister: A History |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; More or less extensively adapted, this choral tradition also became the direct inspiration for robed choirs leading congregational worship in a wide range of Christian denominations.

In 1719 the cathedral choirs of [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]], [[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]] and [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]] combined to establish the annual [[Three Choirs Festival]], the precursor for the multitude of summer music festivals since. By the 20th century, the choral tradition had become for many the most accessible face of worldwide Anglicanism – especially as promoted through the regular broadcasting of choral evensong by the [[BBC]]; and also in the annual televising of the festival of [[Nine lessons and carols]] from [[King's College, Cambridge]]. Composers closely concerned with this tradition include [[Edward Elgar]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] and [[Benjamin Britten]]. A number of important 20th century works by non-Anglican composers were originally commissioned for the Anglican choral tradition – for example the ''[[Chichester Psalms]]'' of [[Leonard Bernstein]], and the ''[[Nunc dimittis]]'' of [[Arvo Pärt]].

==Organization of the Anglican Communion==
{{Main|Anglican Communion}}

===Principles of governance===
Contrary to popular misconception, the British monarch is not the constitutional &quot;Head&quot; but in law &quot;The Supreme Governor&quot; of the Church of England, nor does he or she have any role in provinces outside England. The role of the crown in the Church of England is practically limited to the appointment of bishops, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, and even this role is limited, as the Church presents the government with a short list of candidates to choose from. This process is accomplished through collaboration with and consent of ecclesial representatives ''(see [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]])''. The monarch has no constitutional role in Anglican churches in other parts of the world, although the prayer books of several countries where she is head of state maintain prayers for her as sovereign.

A characteristic of Anglicanism is that it has no international juridical authority. All thirty-nine provinces of the Anglican Communion are independent, each with their own [[primate (religion)|primate]] and governing structure. These provinces may take the form of national churches (such as in Canada, Uganda, or Japan) or a collection of nations (such as the West Indies, Central Africa, or South Asia), or geographical regions (such as Vanuatu and Solomon Islands) etc. Within these Communion provinces may exist subdivisions called [[ecclesiastical province]]s, under the jurisdiction of a metropolitan archbishop. All provinces of the Anglican Communion consist of [[diocese]]s, each under the jurisdiction of a [[bishop]]. In the Anglican tradition, bishops must be consecrated according to the strictures of [[apostolic succession]], which Anglicans consider one of the marks of [[Catholicism|catholicity]]. Apart from bishops, there are two other orders of ordained ministry: [[deacon]] and [[priest]]. No requirement is made for [[clerical celibacy]], though many Anglo-Catholic priests have traditionally been bachelors. Because of innovations that occurred at various points after the latter half of the 20th century, women may be ordained as deacons in almost all provinces, as priests in some, and as bishops in a few provinces. [[Anglican religious order]]s and communities, suppressed in England during the Reformation, have re-emerged, especially since the mid-19th century, and now have an international presence and influence.

Government in the Anglican Communion is [[synod]]ical, consisting of three houses of [[laity]] (usually elected parish representatives), [[clergy]], and bishops. National, provincial, and diocesan synods maintain different scopes of authority, depending on their [[canon law|canons and constitutions]]. Anglicanism is not [[Congregationalist polity|congregational]] in its polity: It is the diocese, not the parish church, which is the smallest unit of authority in the church, and diocesan bishops must give their assent to resolutions passed by synods. ''(See [[Episcopal polity]]).

===Archbishop of Canterbury===
[[File:Archbishcantarms.PNG|thumb|right|150px|Arms of the [[episcopal see|See]] of Canterbury]]
The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] has a precedence of honour over the other primates of the Anglican Communion, and for a province to be considered a part of the Communion means specifically to be in full communion with the [[episcopal see|See]] of [[Province of Canterbury|Canterbury]]. The Archbishop is, therefore, recognised as ''[[primus inter pares]]'', or first amongst equals even though he does not exercise any direct authority in any [[province (Anglican)|province]] outside England, of which he is chief primate. [[Rowan Williams]], the Archbishop of Canterbury since 2003, was the first archbishop appointed from outside the Church of England since the Reformation: he was formerly the [[Archbishop of Wales]].

As &quot;spiritual head&quot; of the Communion, the Archbishop of Canterbury maintains a certain moral authority, and has the right to determine which churches will be in communion with his [[Episcopal See|See]]. He hosts and chairs the [[Lambeth Conference]]s of Anglican Communion bishops, and decides who will be invited to them. He also hosts and chairs the [[Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting]] and is responsible for the invitations to it. He acts as president of the secretariat of the Anglican Communion Office, and its deliberative body, the [[Anglican Consultative Council]].

===Conferences===
The Anglican Communion has no international juridical organisation. All international bodies are consultative and collaborative, and their resolutions are not legally binding on the independent provinces of the Communion. There are three international bodies of note.

* The [[Lambeth Conference]] is the oldest international consultation. It was first convened by Archbishop [[Charles Longley]] in 1867 as a vehicle for bishops of the Communion to &quot;discuss matters of practical interest, and pronounce what we deem expedient in resolutions which may serve as safe guides to future action.&quot; Since then, it has been held roughly every ten years. Invitation is by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
* The [[Anglican Consultative Council]] was created by a 1968 Lambeth Conference resolution, and meets [[wikt:biennial|biennially]]. The council consists of representative bishops, clergy, and laity chosen by the thirty-eight provinces. The body has a permanent secretariat, the Anglican Communion Office, of which the Archbishop of Canterbury is president.
* The [[Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting]] is the most recent manifestation of international consultation and deliberation, having been first convened by Archbishop [[Donald Coggan]] in 1978 as a forum for &quot;leisurely thought, prayer and deep consultation&quot;{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

===Ordained ministry===
[[File:Chasublepurple.jpg|right|thumb|Priest in Eucharistic [[vestment]]s]]

{{details|Anglican ministry|the Anglican priesthood}}
Like the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic]] churches, the Anglican Communion maintains the threefold ministry of deacons, priests and bishops.

====Episcopate====
{{Main|Bishop}}
[[Bishop]]s, who possess the fullness of Christian priesthood, are the successors of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. Primates, archbishops and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]] are all bishops and members of the [[historical episcopate]] who derive their authority through [[apostolic succession]] – an unbroken line of bishops that can be traced back to the 12 apostles of [[Jesus]].

====Priesthood====
Bishops are assisted by [[Episcopal priest|priests]] and [[deacon]]s. Most ordained ministers in the Anglican Communion are [[priest]]s, who usually work in [[parish]]es within a [[diocese]]. Priests are in charge of the spiritual life of parishes are usually called the [[rector]] or [[vicar]]. A [[curate]] (or, more correctly, an 'assistant curate') is a term often used for a priest or deacon who assists the parish priest. Non-parochial priests may earn their living by any vocation, although employment by educational institutions or charitable organizations is most common. Priests also serve as chaplains of hospitals, schools, prisons, and in the armed forces.

An [[archdeacon]] is a priest or deacon responsible for administration of an [[archdeaconry]], which is often the name given to the principal subdivisions of a [[diocese]]. An archdeacon represents the diocesan bishop in his or her archdeaconry. In the [[Church of England]] the position of archdeacon can only be held by someone in priestly orders who has been ordained for at least six years. In some other parts of the Anglican Communion the position can also be held by deacons. In parts of the Anglican Communion where women cannot be ordained as priests or bishops but can be ordained as deacons, the position of archdeacon is effectively the most senior office an ordained woman can be appointed to.

A [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] is a priest who is chief resident cleric of a cathedral or other collegiate church and the head of the chapter of canons. If the cathedral or collegiate church has its own parish, the dean is usually also rector of the parish. However, in the Church of Ireland the roles are often separated, and most cathedrals in the Church of England do not have associated parishes. In the Church in Wales, however, most cathedrals are parish churches, and their deans are now also vicars of their parishes.

The Anglican Communion recognizes [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] ordinations as valid. Outside the Anglican Communion, Anglican ordinations (at least of male priests) are recognized by the [[Old Catholic Church]] and various [[Independent Catholic]] churches.

====Diaconate====
[[File:Stoledeacon.jpg|thumb|The vestments of a deacon, including a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] over his left shoulder]]
{{Main|Deacon}}
In Anglican churches, deacons often work directly in ministry to the marginalised inside and outside the church: the poor, the sick, the hungry, the imprisoned. Unlike Orthodox and Roman Catholic deacons who may be married only before ordination, deacons are permitted to marry freely both before and after ordination, as are priests. Most deacons are preparing for priesthood, and usually only remain as deacons for about a year before being ordained priests. However, there are some deacons who remain deacons. Many provinces of the [[Anglican Communion]] ordain both women and men as deacons. Many of those provinces that ordain women to the priesthood previously allowed them to be ordained only to the diaconate. The effect of this was the creation of a large and overwhelmingly female diaconate for a time, as most men proceeded to be ordained priest after a short time as a deacon.

Deacons may [[baptism|baptize]] and in some dioceses are granted licences to [[wedding|solemnize matrimony]], usually under the instruction of their parish priest and [[bishop]]. They sometimes officiate at [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]], in the churches that have this service. Deacons are not permitted to preside at the [[Eucharist]] (but can lead worship with the distribution of already-consecrated Communion where this is permitted), [[absolution (religious)|absolve sins]] or [[blessing|pronounce a blessing]] in the name of the Church,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katapi.org.uk/ChristianFaith/LXIII.htm#IV The Christian Faith: Ch 63- Ordination- (2) As a Sacrament&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (however, these last two are sometimes permitted in an indirect form). It is the prohibition against deacons pronouncing a blessing in the Church's name that leads some in the church to believe that a deacon cannot properly solemnize matrimony. In most cases, deacons minister alongside other clergy.

===Laity===
All baptised members of the church are called Christian [[Faithful (baptized Catholic)|faithful]], truly equal in dignity and in the work to build the church. Some non-ordained people also have a formal public ministry, often on a full-time and life-long basis – such as [[lay reader]]s (also known as readers), [[churchwarden]]s, [[verger]]s and [[sexton (office)|sextons]]. Other lay positions include acolytes (male or female, often children), lay [[eucharistic minister]]s (also known as chalice bearers) and lay eucharistic visitors (who deliver consecrated bread and wine to &quot;shut-ins&quot; or members of the parish who are unable to leave home or hospital to attend the eucharist). Lay people also serve on the parish altar guild (preparing the altar and caring for its candles, linens, flowers, etc.), in the choir and as cantors, as ushers and greeters and on the church council (called the &quot;vestry&quot; in some countries) which is the governing body of a parish.

===Religious life===
{{See also|Anglican religious order|Anglican devotions}}
A small yet influential aspect of Anglicanism is its [[Anglican religious order|religious orders]] and communities. Shortly after the beginning of the [[Catholic Revival]] in the Church of England, there was a renewal of interest in re-establishing religious and monastic orders and communities. One of Henry VIII's earliest acts was their [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] and seizure of their assets. In 1841 [[Marian Rebecca Hughes]] became the first woman to take the vows of religion in communion with the [[Province of Canterbury]] since the Reformation. In 1848, [[Priscilla Lydia Sellon]] became the superior of the [[Society of the Most Holy Trinity]] at Devonport, Plymouth, the first organised religious order. Sellon is called &quot;the restorer, after three centuries, of the religious life in the Church of England.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Thomas J.|last=Williams|title=Priscilla Lydia Sellon|location=London|publisher=SPCK|year=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next one hundred years, religious orders for both men and women proliferated throughout the world, becoming a numerically small but disproportionately influential feature of global Anglicanism.

Anglican religious life at one time boasted hundreds of orders and communities, and thousands of [[religious order|religious]]. An important aspect of Anglican religious life is that most communities of both men and women lived their lives consecrated to [[God]] under the [[vow]]s of [[poverty]], [[sexual abstinence|chastity]] and [[Vow of obedience|obedience]] (or in [[Benedictine]] communities, Stability, Conversion of Life, and Obedience) by practicing a mixed life of reciting the full eight services of the [[Breviary]] in choir, along with a daily [[Eucharist]], plus service to the poor. The mixed life, combining aspects of the contemplative orders and the active orders remains to this day a hallmark of Anglican religious life. Another distinctive feature of Anglican religious life is the existence of some mixed-gender communities.

Since the 1960s there has been a sharp decline in the number of professed religious in most parts of the Anglican Communion, especially in North America, Europe, and Australia. Many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single [[convent]] or [[monastery]] with memberships of elderly men or women. In the last few decades of the 20th century, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct. There are however, still thousands of Anglican religious working today in approximately 200 communities around the world, and religious life in many parts of the Communion – especially in developing nations – flourishes.

The most significant growth has been in the [[Melanesia]]n countries of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[Melanesian Brotherhood]], founded at [[Tabalia]], [[Guadalcanal (Pacific Ocean island)|Guadalcanal]], in 1925 by Ini Kopuria, is now the largest Anglican Community in the world with over 450 [[monk|brothers]] in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, the [[Philippines]] and the United Kingdom. The [[Sisters of the Church]], started by Mother [[Emily Ayckbowm]] in England in 1870, has more [[nun|sisters]] in the Solomons than all their other communities. The [[Community of the Sisters of Melanesia]], started in 1980 by [[Sister Nesta Tiboe]], is a growing community of women throughout the Solomon Islands. The [[Society of Saint Francis]], founded as a union of various [[Franciscan]] orders in the 1920s, has experienced great growth in the Solomon Islands. Other communities of religious have been started by Anglicans in Papua New Guinea and in Vanuatu. Most Melanesian Anglican religious are in their early to mid 20s – vows may be temporary and it is generally assumed that brothers, at least, will leave and marry in due course – making the average age 40 to 50 years younger than their brothers and sisters in other countries. Growth of religious orders, especially for women, is marked in certain parts of [[Africa]].

===Worldwide distribution===
[[File:Anglican C., Porvoo C., Utrecht Union.svg|right|thumb|250px|A world map showing the Provinces of the '''Anglican Communion''' (Blue). Shown are the Churches in full communion with the Anglican Church: The Nordic Lutheran churches of the [[Porvoo Communion]] (Green), and the [[Old Catholic Church]]es in the [[Utrecht Union]] (Red).]]
Anglicanism represents the third largest Christian communion in the world, after the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es. The number of Anglicans in the world is slightly over 77&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Christianity Major Branches of Religions]&lt;/ref&gt; The 11 provinces in Africa saw explosive growth in the last two decades. They now include 36.7&amp;nbsp;million members, more Anglicans than there are in England. England remains the largest single Anglican province, with 26&amp;nbsp;million members. In most industrialised countries, church attendance has decreased since the 19th century. Anglicanism's presence in the rest of the world is due to large-scale emigration, the establishment of expatriate communities or the work of missionaries.

The [[Church of England]] has been a church of [[missionary|missionaries]] since the 17th century when the Church first left English shores with colonists who founded what would become the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa and established Anglican churches. For example, an Anglican chaplain, [[Robert Wolfall]], with [[Martin Frobisher]]'s [[Arctic]] expedition celebrated the Eucharist in 1578 in [[Frobisher Bay]].

[[File:St Mary's Church Chennai.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Church of South India|CSI]] [[St. Mary's Church Chennai|St. Mary's Church]], [[Chennai]]. This is the first Anglican Church in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2005/12/18/stories/2005121801371100.htm The Hindu Restoration work under way at St. Mary's Church]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The first Anglican church in the Americas was built at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1607. By the 18th century, missionaries worked to establish Anglican churches in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The great Church of England missionary societies were founded; for example the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]] (SPCK) in 1698. [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]] (SPG) in 1701, and the [[Church Mission Society]] (CMS) in 1799. The 19th century saw the founding and expansion of social oriented evangelism with societies such as the [[Church Pastoral Aid Society]] (CPAS) in 1836, [[Mission to Seafarers]] in 1856, [[Mothers' Union]] in 1876 and [[Church Army]] in 1882 all carrying out a personal form of evangelism. The 20th century saw the Church of England developing new forms of evangelism such as the [[Alpha course]] in 1990 which was developed and propagated from [[Holy Trinity Brompton Church]] in [[London]]. In the 21st century, there has been renewed effort to reach children and youth. [[Fresh expressions]] is a Church of England missionary initiative to youth begun in 2005, and has ministries at a [[skate park]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacyweb.org/YouthCong.htm Legacy XS Youth Centre &amp; Skatepark, St. George's, Benfleet]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the efforts of St George's Church, [[Benfleet]], [[Essex]] – [[Diocese of Chelmsford]] – or youth groups with evocative names, like the C.L.A.W (Christ Little Angels – Whatever!) youth group at [[Coventry Cathedral]]. And for the unchurched who do not actually wish to visit a bricks and mortar church there are Internet ministries such as the [[Diocese of Oxford]]'s online Anglican [[i-Church]] which appeared on the web in 2005.

===Ecumenism===
{{details|Anglican communion and ecumenism|the on-going dialogue between Anglicanism and the wider Church}}

Anglican interest in [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] dialogue can be traced back to the time of the Reformation and dialogues with both Orthodox and Lutheran churches in the 16th century. In the 19th century, with the rise of the Oxford Movement, there arose greater concern for reunion of the churches of &quot;Catholic confession.&quot; This desire to work towards full [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with other denominations led to the development of the [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]], approved by the Third [[Lambeth Conference]] of 1888. The four points (the sufficiency of scripture, the historic creeds, the two dominical sacraments, and the historic episcopate) were proposed as a basis for discussion, although they have frequently been taken as a non-negotiable bottom-line for any form of reunion.

===Theological diversity===
Anglicanism in general has always sought a balance between the emphases of [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]], while tolerating a range of expressions of [[evangelicalism]] and ceremony. Clergy and laity from all Anglican [[churchmanship]] traditions have been active in the formation of the Continuing movement.

While there are [[high church]], [[broad church]], and [[low church]] Continuing Anglicans, many Continuing churches are [[Anglo-Catholic]] with highly ceremonial liturgical practices. Others belong to a more Evangelical or [[low church]] tradition and tend to support the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] and simpler worship services. [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]], for instance, is often used instead of the [[Holy Eucharist]] for Sunday worship services, although this is not necessarily true of all low church parishes.

Most Continuing churches in the United States reject the 1979 revision of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] by the Episcopal Church and use the 1928 version for their services instead. In addition, Anglo-Catholic bodies may use the [[Anglican Missal]] or [[English Missal]] in celebrating the Eucharist.

===Basis for Unity===
{{See also|Federation of Anglican Churches in the Americas}}
In 2008 various jurisdictions made attempts at overcoming the movement's divisions. The [[Anglican Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Province of Christ the King]], and the [[United Episcopal Church of North America]] entered into discussions about possible organic unity. In January 2009 one bishop from each jurisdiction consecrated three suffragan bishops in St. Louis, just a few miles from where the [[Congress of St. Louis]] first met. The three new bishops will serve all three jurisdictions.

In addition, the [[Anglican Episcopal Church]] and the [[Diocese of the Great Lakes]] formed the ''North American Anglican Conference'' for mutual assistance between Evangelical Anglican churches. A suffragan bishop was consecrated for the Anglican Episcopal Church in late 2008 by its presiding bishop and three bishops of the Diocese of the Great Lakes.

The principles of the [[Affirmation of St. Louis]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of Religion, provide some basis for unity in the movement, but the jurisdictions are numerous, usually quite small in membership and often splinter and recombine. Reports put the number of jurisdictions at somewhere between 20 and 40, mostly in North America, but fewer than a dozen of the churches popularly called Continuing churches can be traced back to the meeting in St. Louis.

==Role in civilisation==
Anglican concern with broader issues of social justice can be traced to its earliest divines. Richard Hooker, for instance, wrote that &quot;God hath created nothing simply for itself, but each thing in all things, and of every thing each part in other have such interest, that in the whole world nothing is found whereunto any thing created can say, 'I need thee not.'&quot; This, and related statements, reflect the deep thread of [[Incarnation|incarnational theology]] running through Anglican social thought – a theology which sees God, nature, and humanity in dynamic interaction, and the interpenetration of the secular and the sacred in the make-up of the cosmos. Such theology is informed by a traditional English spiritual ethos, rooted in Celtic Christianity and reinforced by Anglicanism's origins as an [[established church]], bound up by its structure in the life and interests of civil society.

Repeatedly, throughout Anglican history, this principle has reasserted itself in movements of social justice. For instance, in the 18th century the influential Evangelical Anglican [[William Wilberforce]], along with others, campaigned against the slave trade. In the 19th century, the dominant issues concerned the adverse effects of industrialisation. The usual Anglican response was to focus on education and give support to 'The National Society for the Education of the Children of the Poor in the principles of the Church of England'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kitson Clark |first=G. |authorlink=George Kitson Clark|title=Churchmen and the Condition of England 1832–1885 |year=1973 |publisher=Methuen |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Shaftesbury, a devout Evangelical, campaigned to improve the conditions in factories, in mines, for chimney sweeps, and for the education of the very poor. For years he was chairman of the Ragged School Board. Frederick Denison Maurice was a leading figure advocating reform, founding so-called &quot;producer's co-operatives&quot; and the [[Working Men's College]]. His work was instrumental in the establishment of the [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] movement, although he himself was not in any real sense a socialist but, &quot;a Tory paternalist with the unusual desire to theories his acceptance of the traditional obligation to help the poor&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=E.&amp;nbsp;R. |last=Norman |title=Church and Society in England 1770–1970 |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |year=1976 |pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced Anglo-Catholics such as Charles Gore, who wrote that, &quot;the principle of the incarnation is denied unless the Christian spirit can be allowed to concern itself with everything that interests and touches human life.&quot; Anglican focus on labour issues culminated in the work of [[William Temple (archbishop)|William Temple]] in the 1930s and 1940s.

===Pacifism===
{{Ref improve section|date=December 2010}}

A question of whether or not Christianity is a [[pacifist]] religion has remained a matter of debate for Anglicans. In 1937, the [[Anglican Pacifist Fellowship]] emerged as a distinct reform organisation, seeking to make pacifism a clearly defined part of Anglican theology. The group rapidly gained popularity amongst Anglican intellectuals, including [[Vera Brittain]], [[Evelyn Underhill]] and former British political leader [[George Lansbury]]. Furthermore, the Reverend [[Hugh Richard Lawrie Sheppard|Dick Sheppard]], who during the 1930s was one of Britain's most famous Anglican priests due to his landmark sermon broadcasts for [[BBC]] [[radio]], founded the [[Peace Pledge Union]] a [[secular]] pacifist organisation for the non-religious that gained considerable support throughout the 1930s.

Whilst never actively endorsed by the Anglican Church, many Anglicans unofficially have adopted the Augustinian &quot;[[Just War]]&quot; doctrine. The Anglican Pacifist Fellowship remain highly active throughout the Anglican world. It rejects this doctrine of &quot;just war&quot; and seeks to reform the Church by reintroducing the pacifism inherent in the beliefs of many of the earliest Christians and present in their interpretation of Christ's [[Sermon on the Mount]]. The principles of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowhip are often formulated as a statement of belief that &quot;Jesus' teaching is incompatible with the waging of war, that a Christian church should never support or justify war and that our Christian witness should include opposing the waging or justifying of war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/ Anglican Pacifist Fellowship&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Confusing the matter was the fact that the 37th Article of Religion in the Book of Common Prayer states that &quot;it is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to wear weapons, and serve in the wars.&quot; Therefore, the Lambeth Council in the modern era has sought to provide a clearer position by repudiating modern war and developed a statement that has been affirmed at each subsequent meeting of the Council. This statement was strongly reasserted when &quot;the 67th General Convention of the Episcopal Church reaffirms the statement made by the Anglican Bishops assembled at Lambeth in 1978 and adopted by the 66th General Convention of the Episcopal Church in 1979, calling &quot;Christian people everywhere ... to engage themselves in non-violent action for justice and peace and to support others so engaged, recognizing that such action will be controversial and may be personally very costly... this General Convention, in obedience to this call, urges all members of this Church to support by prayer and by such other means as they deem appropriate, those who engaged in such non-violent action, and particularly those who suffer for conscience' sake as a result; and be it further Resolved, that this General Convention calls upon all members of this Church seriously to consider the implications for their own lives of this call to resist war and work for peace for their own lives.&quot;

===After World War II===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}

[[File:Archbishop-Tutu-medium.jpg|right|thumb|[[Desmond Tutu]] (born 1931), former Primate of the Anglican [[Church of the Province of South Africa]], is a noted [[pacifist]] and a leading figure in the successful fight against apartheid]]
The focus on other social issues became increasingly diffuse after the [[Second World War]]. On the one hand, the growing independence and strength of Anglican churches in the global south brought new emphasis to issues of global poverty, the inequitable distribution of resources, and the lingering effects of colonialism. In this regard, figures such as [[Desmond Tutu]] and [[Ted Scott]] were instrumental in mobilizing Anglicans worldwide against the [[apartheid]] policies of [[South Africa]]. Rapid social change in the industrialised world during the 20th century compelled the church to examine issues of gender, sexuality and marriage.

These changes led to Lambeth Conference resolutions countenancing [[contraception]] and the [[remarriage]] of divorced persons. They led to most provinces approving the [[ordination of women]]. In more recent years it has led some jurisdictions to permit the ordination of people in same-sex relationships and to authorise rites for the blessing of same-sex unions (see [[homosexuality and Anglicanism]]). More conservative elements within Anglicanism (primarily African churches and factions within North American Anglicanism) have opposed these proposals. Some liberal and moderate Anglicans see this opposition as representing a new [[fundamentalism]] within Anglicanism. Others see the advocacy for these proposals as representing a breakdown of Christian theology and commitment. The lack of social consensus among and within provinces of diverse cultural traditions has resulted in considerable conflict and even schism concerning some or all of these developments (see [[Anglican realignment]]). Some Anglicans opposed to various liberalising changes, in particular the [[ordination of women]], have converted to Roman Catholicism. Others have, at various times, joined the [[Continuing Anglican movement]].

These latter trends reflect a countervailing tendency in Anglicanism towards insularity, reinforced perhaps by the &quot;big tent&quot; nature of the movement, which seeks to be comprehensive of various views and tendencies. The insularity and complacency of the early established [[Church of England]] has tended to influence Anglican self-identity, and inhibit engagement with the broader society in favour of internal debate and dialogue. Nonetheless, there is significantly greater cohesion among Anglicans when they turn their attention outward. Anglicans worldwide are active in many areas of social and environmental concern.

==Continuing Anglicanism==
{{Continuing Anglican}}{{Main|Continuing Anglican movement}}
Continuing Anglican refers to a number of church bodies formed outside of the [[Anglican Communion]]. These churches generally believe that traditional forms of Anglican faith and worship have been unacceptably revised or abandoned within some Anglican Communion churches in recent decades and thus claim that they are &quot;continuing&quot; the traditional forms of Anglicanism. The modern Continuing movement principally dates to the [[Congress of St. Louis]] in the United States in 1977, at which participants rejected changes that had been made in the Episcopal Church's [[Book of Common Prayer]] and the [[ordination of women]]. More recent changes in the North American churches of the Anglican Communion, such as the ordination of gay and lesbian people to the [[priesthood]] and [[episcopate]], have created further separations.

Continuing churches have generally been formed by people and churches who have left the [[Anglican Communion]]. These older Anglican churches are charged by the Continuing movement with being greatly compromised by secular cultural standards and liberal approaches to theology. Many Continuing Anglicans believe that the faith of some churches in communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury has become either [[heterodox|unorthodox]] or un-Christian{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} and therefore have not sought to also be in communion with him.

Although the term ''Anglican'' usually refers to those churches in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/faith/anglican/ Accessed 9 November 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; many Continuing Anglicanism bodies in the United States, use the term ''Anglican'' to differentiate themselves from the Episcopal Church.

The original generation of Continuing parishes in the United States were found mainly in metropolitan areas. Since the late 1990s a number have appeared in smaller communities, often as a result of a division in the town's existing Episcopal parish(es) or mission(s). The 2007–08 ''Directory of Traditional Anglican and Episcopal Parishes'', published by The Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen, contained information on over 900 parishes affiliated with either the Continuing Anglican churches or the Anglican realignment movement.

==Ordinariates within the Roman Catholic Church==
On 4 November 2009 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] issued an [[apostolic constitution]], ''[[Anglicanorum Coetibus]]'', to allow groups of former Anglicans to enter into [[full communion]] with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as members of [[personal ordinariate]]s. The announcement of the imminent constitution on 20 October 2009 mentioned:

{{quote|Today's announcement of the Apostolic Constitution is a response by Pope Benedict XVI to a number of requests over the past few years to the Holy See from groups of Anglicans who wish to enter into full visible communion with the Roman Catholic Church, and are willing to declare that they share a common Catholic faith and accept the Petrine ministry as willed by Christ for his Church.

Pope Benedict XVI has approved, within the Apostolic Constitution, a canonical structure that provides for Personal Ordinariates, which will allow former Anglicans to enter full communion with the Catholic Church while preserving elements of distinctive Anglican spiritual patrimony.

The announcement of this Apostolic Constitution brings to an end a period of uncertainty for such groups who have nurtured hopes of new ways of embracing unity with the Catholic Church. It will now be up to those who have made requests to the Holy See to respond to the Apostolic Constitution.|The Archbishop of Westminster and The Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/news.cfm/2009/10/20/ACNS4662 &quot;Joint Statement by The Archbishop of Westminster and The Archbishop of Canterbury&quot;], Anglican Communion News Network, 20 October 2009. Retrieved on 20 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For each personal ordinariate the [[ordinary]] may be a former Anglican bishop or priest. It is expected that provision will be made to allow the retention of aspects of Anglican liturgy; cf. [[Anglican Use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/oct/20/roman-catholic-church-receives-anglicans | accessdate = 20 October 2009 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Roman Catholic church to receive Anglicans | first1=Riazat | last1=Butt | first2=John | last2=Hooper | date=20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heritage of the [[Classical Greece|classical era]] is still evident in the city, represented by a number of [[ancient monument]]s and works of art, the most famous of all being the [[Parthenon]], widely considered a key landmark of early [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. The city also retains a vast variety of [[Roman Greece|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] monuments, as well as a smaller number of remaining [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] monuments projecting the city's long history across the centuries. Athens is home to two [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]], the [[Acropolis of Athens]] and the medieval [[Daphni Monastery]]. Landmarks of the modern era, dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1833, include the [[Hellenic Parliament]] (19th century) and the Athens Trilogy consisting of the [[National Library of Greece]], the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|Athens University]] and the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]].

==Etymology==
{{See|Names of European cities in different languages: A}}
[[File:Athena column-Academy of Athens.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Statue of [[Athena]], patron goddess of the city of Athens. [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]].]]

In [[Ancient Greek]], the name of Athens was: '''{{Polytonic|Ἀθῆναι}}''' {{IPA-el|atʰɛ̂ːnai|}}, related tο the name of the goddess [[Athena]] ([[Attic Greek|Attic]] {{Polytonic|Ἀθηνᾶ}} {{IPA|[atʰɛːnâː]}} and [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] {{Polytonic|Ἀθήνη}} {{IPA|[aˈtʰɛːnɛː]}}).
In [[Homeric Greek]] the city's name was in the [[Grammatical number|singular]] form ({{Polytonic|Ἀθήνη}}&lt;ref&gt;As for example in [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+7&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0135 Od.7.80]&lt;/ref&gt;) then changed in the plural, like those of {{Polytonic|Θῆβαι}} ([[Thebes, Greece|''Thēbai'']]), {{Polytonic|Μυκῆναι}} ([[Mycenae|''Mukēnai'']]), and {{Polytonic|Δελφοί}} ([[Delphi|''Delphoi'']]).

An [[etiological myth]] explaining how Athens acquired this name was well known amongst ancient Athenians and even became the theme of the sculpture on the West pediment of the [[Parthenon]]. Both [[Athena]] and [[Poseidon]] requested to be patrons of the city and to give their name to it, so they competed with one another for the honor, offering the city one gift each. Poseidon produced a salt water [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] by striking the ground with his trident, symbolizing [[naval power]]. Athena created the [[Olive oil#History|olive tree]], symbolizing [[Olive branch|peace]] and [[prosperity]]. The Athenians, under their ruler [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], accepted the olive tree and named the city after Athena.

Since the official abandonment of [[Katharevousa]] Greek in the 1970s, the [[demotic Greek|demotic]] ''Αθήνα'' (''Athína'' / {{IPA|[aˈθina]}}) has become the city's official name in place of  {{Polytonic|Ἀθῆναι}}.

==History==
{{Main|History of Athens}}

The oldest known human presence in Athens is the Cave of Schist which has been dated to between the 11th and 7th millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=11380&amp;subid=2&amp;tag=8796&amp;pubid=2530782 |title=v4.ethnos.gr – Οι πρώτοι... Αθηναίοι – τεχνες , πολιτισμος |publisher=Ethnos.gr |accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athens has been continuously inhabited for at least 7000 years.&lt;ref&gt;S. Immerwahr, The Athenian Agora XII: the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, Princeton 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tung/&gt;

By 1400 BC the settlement had become an important centre of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] civilization and the Acropolis was the site of a major [[Mycenae]]an fortress whose remains can be recognised from sections of the characteristic [[Cyclopean]] walls.&lt;ref&gt;Iakovides, S. 1962. 'E mykenaïke akropolis ton Athenon'. Athens.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other Mycenaean centers, such as [[Mycenae]] and [[Pylos]], it is not known whether Athens suffered destruction in about 1200 BC, an event often attributed to a [[Dorians|Dorian]] invasion, and the Athenians always maintained that they were &quot;pure&quot; [[Ionia]]ns with no Dorian element. However, Athens, [[Bronze Age collapse|like many other Bronze Age settlements]], went into economic decline for around 150 years following this.

{{wide image|Acropolis from a top Philopappos Hill.jpg|600px|&lt;center&gt;[[Acropolis of Athens]].&lt;/center&gt;.}}

[[Iron Age]] burials, in the [[Kerameikos]] and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900 BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region; as were [[Lefkandi]] in [[Euboea]] and [[Knossos]] in Crete.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, R. 1996, 2009. ''Greece in the Making 1200 – 479 BC''.&lt;/ref&gt; This position may well have resulted from its central location in the Greek world, its secure stronghold on the Acropolis and its access to the sea, which gave it a natural advantage over inland rivals such as [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and [[Sparta]].

[[File:Bonfils, Félix (1831-1885) - Athens - Acropolis about 1868-1875.jpg|thumb|Athens c.1868.]]

[[Classical Athens]] became the leading city of [[Ancient Greece]] in the 5th century BC, with its cultural achievements laying the foundations of [[western culture|Western civilization]]. It was eventually overcome by its rival city-state of [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aroundgreece.com/ancient-greece-history/sparta-greece.php |title=Sparta Ancient Greece – Greek History |publisher=Aroundgreece.com |date=5 April 2007 |accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of [[Late Antiquity]] the city experienced decline followed by recovery in the second half of the Middle Byzantine Period (9th–10th centuries AD), and was relatively prosperous during the [[Crusades]], benefiting from Italian trade. In 1453 it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and entered a long period of decline.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Following the [[Greek War of Independence]], Athens was chosen as the capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely due to historical and sentimental reasons. At the time it was a town of modest size built around the foot of the Acropolis. The first [[King of Greece]], Otto of Bavaria, commissioned the architects Stamatios Kleanthis and Gustav Schaubert to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.

The first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the [[Acropolis]], the ancient cemetery of [[Kerameikos]] and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the [[Greek Parliament]]), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital. In 1896 Athens hosted the first modern [[Olympic Games]]. During the 1920s a number of Greek refugees, expelled from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]], swelled Athens' population; nevertheless it was most particularly following [[World War II]], and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded, and Athens experienced a gradual expansion in all directions. In the 1980s it became evident that smog from factories and an ever increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge. A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the [[Attiki Odos]] motorway, the expansion of the [[Athens Metro]], and the new [[Athens International Airport]]), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city.

==Politics==
[[File:Prefectures of Attica athens.png|thumb|The former [[Athens Prefecture]] (blue), within the periphery of [[Attica]] (grey).]]

Athens became the [[Capital city|capital]] of Greece in 1834, following [[Nafplion]] which was the provisional capital from 1829. In addition, the municipality of Athens is the capital of the [[Attica Periphery]]. ''Athens'' can refer either to the municipality of Athens or to the entire [[urban area]]. It sometimes refers only to the Athens Prefecture, which is part of the urban area.

===Attica Periphery===

Athens is located within the Attica Periphery, which encompasses the most populated region of Greece, with around 3.7 million people.&lt;ref name=population/&gt; The Attica Periphery itself is split into eight [[peripheral units of Greece|peripheral units]], out of which four form the Greater Athens area:&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;{{PDFlink|1=[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis reform law text]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is, however, one of the smaller peripheries in Greece, with an area of {{convert|3808|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=area/&gt;

Until 2010, the first four municipalities comprised the [[Athens Prefecture]], which was the most populous of the [[Prefectures of Greece]], accounting for 2,664,776 people (in 2001),&lt;ref name=population/&gt; with an area of {{convert|361|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=area/&gt;

===Athens Municipality===
[[File:Athens dimotiko diamerisma.PNG|thumb|The seven districts of Athens municipality]]

The [[municipality]] of Athens is the [[List of cities in Greece|most populous in Greece]], with a population of 745,514 people (in 2001)&lt;ref name=population/&gt; and an area of {{convert|39|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=area/&gt; The current [[List of mayors of Athens|mayor of Athens]] is [[Giorgos Kaminis]]. It is divided into seven municipal districts. The 7-district division is mainly used for administrative purposes. For Athenians the most popular way of dividing the city proper is through its neighbourhoods such as [[Pangrati|Pagkrati]], [[Ambelokipi, Athens|Ambelokipi]], [[Exarcheia]], [[Patissia]], [[Ilissia]], [[Petralona]], [[Koukaki]] and [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]], each with its own distinct history and characteristics.

==Geography==
[[File:Athene-sat.JPG|thumb|View of the ''Attica Basin'' from space.]]

Athens sprawls across the central plain of [[Attica]] that is often referred to as the ''Attica or Athens Basin''. The basin is bound by four large mountains; Mount [[Egaleo|Aegaleo]] to the west, Mount [[Parnitha]] to the north, Mount [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]] to the northeast and Mount [[Hymettus]] to the east of the Athens Metropolitan Area&lt;ref name=&quot;Focus on Athens&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanheatisland.info/images/newsletter/UHI_newsletter_Issue_1.pdf | title=Focus on Athens| accessdate=18 March 2011 | work=UHI Quarterly Newsletter, Issue 1, May 2009, page 2|publisher=www.urbanheatisland.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also the extension of the Athens basin is the [[Thriasian plain]] west of the capital. The [[Saronic Gulf]] lies in the southwest. Mount Parnitha is the tallest of the four mountains ({{convert|1413|m|ft|0|abbr=on}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parnitha-np.gr/welcome.htm |title=Welcome!!! |publisher=Parnitha-np.gr |accessdate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been declared a [[national park]].

Athens is built around a number of hills. [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus]] is one of the tallest hills of the city proper and provides a view of the entire Attica Basin. The geomorphology of Athens is deemed to be one of the most complex in the world due to its mountains and causes a [[inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]] phenomenon which, along with the failure of the Greek Government to control industrial pollution, is responsible for the air pollution problems the city has recently faced.&lt;ref name=tung/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minenv.gr/1/12/122/12204/e1220400.html |work=Hellenic Ministry of the Environment and Public Works |title=Daily Report on Air Pollution Levels |accessdate=26 January 2007 |publisher=www.minenv.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Los Angeles]] and [[Mexico City]] also suffer with similar geomorphology inversion problems).&lt;ref name=tung&gt;{{cite book |last=Tung |first=Anthony |chapter=The City the Gods Besieged |title=Preserving the World's Great Cities: The Destruction and Renewal of the Historic Metropolis |year=2001 |location=New York |publisher=Three Rivers Press |isbn=0-609-80815-X |page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==

The Athens region enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa'') with typically warm summers and mild winters. 

With an average of 414.1&amp;nbsp;mm of yearly precipitation, rainfall occurs largely between October and April. July and August are the driest months, with typically one or two sparse thunderstorms a month. 

[[Parnitha|Mount Parnitha]] acts as a rainshadow for the city, as a result of which precipitation is typically lower than other parts of the country.

Athens is perhaps Europe's warmest [[capital city]] during the summer months, surpassed only by a handful of large European cities such as [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] and [[Seville]]. Daily average highs for July have been measured at {{convert|33.5|C|1}} at [[Nea Filalelfia]] weather station, but other parts of the cities may be even warmer. Temperatures often surpass  {{convert|38|°C|°F|0}} during the city's notorious heatwaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Focus on Athens&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esciencenews.com/articles/2009/08/29/esa.helps.make.summer.city.more.bearable|title=European Space Agency to help Athens become bearable in summer |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Winters are mild and rainy, with a January average of {{convert|8.9|C|1}}; in Nea Filadelfia and {{convert|10.3|C|1}} in Hellenikon; 

Snowstorms are infrequent but can cause significant disruption when they occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12674491 visited may 6, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Temperature record===
Athens holds the [[World Meteorological Organisation]] record for the highest temperature ever being recorded in Europe of {{convert|48.0|C|F|1}} which was recorded in [[Eleusina|Elefsina]] and Tatoi suburbs of Athens on 10 July 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wmo.asu.edu/europe-highest-temperature|title=Europe's highest temperature |accessdate=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban Landscape==

The city of Athens contains a variety of different [[architectural style]]s, ranging from [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]], to modern. They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style. Many of the most prominent buildings of the city are either Greco-Roman or neo-classical in styling. Some of the neo-classical structures to be found are public buildings erected during the mid-19th century, under the guidance of [[Baron Theophil von Hansen|Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]] and [[Ernst Ziller]], and include the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]], [[Athens City Hall]], [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek Parliament]], [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament]] (1875–1932) (Now the National Historical Museum),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=1761 Hellenic Ministry of Culture: The Old Parliament Building] – Retrieved 16 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]], and [[Zappeion]] Hall.

====Modern architecture====

[[File:Aigyptou Square Athens.JPG|thumb|The left apartment building constructed in the 1930s is an example of modern architecture in Athens, while the right, built in the 1950s, combines modern and classical elements.]]

Beginning in the 1930s, the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] and other architectural movements such as [[Bauhaus]] and [[Art Deco]] began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and many buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include [[Kolonaki]], and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]].

In the 1950s and 1960s during the vast extension and development of Athens, modern architecture played a very important role. The centre of Athens was largely rebuilt, leading to the demolition of a number of neoclassical buildings. The architects of this era employed materials such as glass, marble and aluminium, while some blended modern and classical elements. After [[World War II]], internationally known architects to have designed and built in the city included [[Walter Gropius]], with his design for the US Embassy, and, amongst others, [[Eero Saarinen]], in his postwar design for the east terminal of the [[Ellinikon International Airport|Ellinikon Airport]].

Notable Greek architects of the 1930s–1960s included [[Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis|Konstantinos Doxiadis]], [[Dimitris Pikionis]], [[Pericles A. Sakellarios]], [[Aris Konstantinidis]] and others.

[[File:Athens - Mount Lycabettus - 20080729a.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mount Lycabettus]] at night.]]
The Municipality of Athens is divided into several districts: [[Omonoia Square|Omonoia]], [[Syntagma Square|Syntagma]], [[Exarcheia]], Agios Nikolaos, Neapolis, [[Mount Lycabettus|Lykavittos]], Lofos Strefi, Lofos Finopoulou, Lofos Filopappou, [[Pedion tou Areos|Pedion Areos]], [[Metaxourgeio]], Aghios Kostantinos, Larissa Station, [[Kerameikos]], [[Psiri]], [[Monastiraki]], [[Gazi, Athens|Gazi]], [[Thiseio|Thission]], [[Church of Panaghia Kapnikarea|Kapnikarea]], Aghia Irini, Aerides, Anafiotika, [[Plaka]], [[Acropolis]], [[Pnyx|Pnyka]], Makrygianni, Lofos Ardittou, [[Zappeion]], Aghios Spyridon, [[Pangrati]]on, [[Kolonaki]], Dexameni, Evaggelismos, Gouva, Aghios Ioannis, [[Neos Kosmos, Athens|Neos Kosmos]], [[Koukaki]], Kynosargous, Fix, Ano Petralona, Kato Petralona, Rouf, [[Votanikos]], Profitis Daniil, [[Akadimia Platonos]], [[Colonus|Kolonos]], Kolokynthou, Attikis Square, Lofos Skouze, Sepolia, [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]], Aghios Meletios, Nea Kypseli, Gyzi, Polygono, [[Ambelokipi, Athens|Ampelokipoi]], Panormou-Gerokomeio, Pentagono, Ellinorosson, [[Filothei|Kato Filothei]], Ano Kypseli, Tourkovounia-Lofos Patatsou, Lofos Elikonos, Koliatsou, Thymarakia, Kato Patisia, Treis Gefyres, Aghios Eleftherios, [[Ano Patissia|Ano Patisia]], Kypriadou, Prompona, Aghios Panteleimonas, Pagrati, Goudi, Ilisia

====Omonoia====
[[Omonoia Square]] ({{lang-el|Πλατεία Ομονοίας}}) is the oldest square in Athens. It is surrounded by hotels and fast food outlets, and contains a train station used by the [[Athens Metro]] and the Ilektrikos, appropriately named [[Omonoia station|Omonoia Station]]. The square often becomes the focus for celebration of sporting victories, as seen after the country's winning of the Euro 2004 and the Eurobasket 2005 tournaments.

====Metaxourgeio====
({{lang-el|Μεταξουργείο}}) is a neighborhood of Athens, Greece. The neighborhood is located south of the historical center of Athens, between Kolonos to the east and Kerameikos to the west, and north of Gazi. [[Metaxourgeio]] is frequently described as a transition neighborhood. After a long period of abandonment in the late 20th century, the area is acquiring a reputation as an artistic and fashionable neighborhood due to the opening of many art galleries, museums, and trendy restaurants and cafes.[1] Moreover, local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighborhood have reinforced a budding sense of community and artistic expression. Anonymous art pieces containing quotes and sayings in both English and Ancient Greek have begun springing up through out the neighborhood, containing statements such as &quot;Art for arts sake&quot; (Τεχνη τεχνης χαριν). [[Guerilla gardening]] has also helped to beautify this area, taking advantage of the ample sunshine in Greece.

====Psiri and Gazi====
[[File:Tehnopolis Athens.JPG|thumb|left|[[Technopolis (Gazi)|Technopolis]], [[Gazi, Athens|Gazi]].]]

The reviving [[Psiri]] ({{lang-el|Ψυρρή}}) neighbourhood – a.k.a. Athens's &quot;meat packing district&quot; – is dotted with renovated former mansions, artists' spaces, and small gallery areas. A number of its renovated buildings also now host a wide variety of fashionable bars, making it a hotspot for the city in the last decade, while a number of live music restaurants known as &quot;rebetadika&quot;, after [[rebetiko]], a unique form of music that blossomed in [[Syros]] and Athens from the 1920s until the 1960s, are also to be found. Rebetiko is admired by many, and as a result rebetadika are often crammed with people of all ages who will sing, dance and drink till dawn. The [[Gazi, Athens|Gazi]] ({{lang-el|Γκάζι}}) area, one of the latest in full redevelopment, is located around a historic gas factory, now converted into the ''[[Technopolis (Gazi)|Technopolis]]'' cultural multiplex, and also includes artists' areas, a number of small clubs, bars and restaurants, as well as Athens' nascent &quot;[[Gay village|Gay Village]]&quot;. The metro's system recent expansion to the western suburbs of the city has brought easier access to the area since spring 2007, as the blue line now stops at Gazi ([[Kerameikos]] station).

====Syntagma====
[[File:Atina-syntagma.JPG|thumb|View of [[Syntagma Square]] and [[Hellenic Parliament]]; Old Royal House.]]

[[Syntagma Square]], ({{lang-el|Σύνταγμα}}/Constitution Square), is the capital's central and [[List of city squares by size|largest square]], lying adjacent to the [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek Parliament]] (the former Royal Palace) and the city's most noted [[Grande Bretagne|hotels]]. Ermou Street, an approximately one kilometer-long pedestrian road connecting [[Syntagma Square]] to Monastiraki, has traditionally been a consumer paradise for both Athenians and tourists. Complete with fashion shops and [[shopping mall|shopping centres]] promoting most international brands, it now finds itself in the top 5 most expensive shopping streets in Europe, and the tenth most expensive retail street in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cushwake.com/cwglobal/jsp/newsDetail.jsp?repId=c7800055p&amp;LanId=EN&amp;LocId=GLOBAL |title=Cushman &amp; Wakefield – Global real estate solutions – News &amp; Events |publisher=Cushwake.com |date=25 October 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby, the renovated Army Fund building in Panepistimiou Street includes the &quot;Attica&quot; [[department store]] and several upmarket designer stores.

====Plaka, Monastiraki, and Thission====
[[File:Temple of Hephaestus.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in the central district of [[Thiseio|Thission]].]]

[[Plaka]] ({{lang-el|Πλάκα}}), lying just beneath the [[Acropolis]], is famous for its plentiful [[neoclassical architecture]], making up one of the most scenic districts of the city. It remains a traditionally prime tourist destination with a number of picturesque [[taverna]]s, live performances and street salesmen. Nearby [[Monastiraki]] ({{lang-el|Μοναστηράκι}}), for its part, is well-known for its string of small shops and markets, as well as its crowded [[flea market]] and tavernas specialising in [[souvlaki]]. Another district notably famous for its student-crammed, stylish cafés is [[Temple of Hephaestus|Theseum]] or Thission ({{lang-el|Θησείο}}), lying just west of Monastiraki. Thission is home to the ancient [[Temple of Hephaestus]], standing atop a small hill. This area also has a picturesque 11th Century Byzantine church, as well as a 15th Century Ottoman mosque.

====Kolonaki====

{{wide image|KOLONAKI PANO.jpg|550px|&lt;center&gt;Panoramic view of [[Kolonaki Square]].&lt;/center&gt;.}}

The [[Kolonaki]] ({{lang-el|Κολωνάκι}}) area, at the base of [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus hill]], is full of boutiques catering to well-heeled customers by day, and bars and more fashionable restaurants by night, but at other points also a wide range of art galleries and museums. This is often regarded as one of the more prestigious areas of the capital.

====Exarcheia====
[[Exarcheia]] ({{lang-el|Εξάρχεια}}), located north of Kolonaki, has a mixed reputation as the recent or current location of the city's [[anarchism|anarchist]] scene and as a culturally active student quarter with many cafés, bars and bookshops. Exarcheia is home to the [[National Technical University of Athens|Athens Polytechnic]] and the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]]; it also contains numerous important buildings of several 20th-century styles: [[Neoclassicism]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Modern architecture|Early Modernism]] (including [[Bauhaus]] influences).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Suburbs===
[[File:Maroussi Center 2 b.jpg|thumb|left|View of the center of [[Marousi]] district.]]
[[File:Athens - Kifissias Avenue - 20080729a.jpg|thumb|View of parts of the city's northern suburbs at night.]]
[[File:Λιμένας Πειραιώς.jpg|thumb|Piraeus Harbour.]]

The Athens Metropolitan Area consists of 73{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} densely populated municipalities, sprawling around the city in virtually all directions. According to their geographic location in relation to the city of Athens, the suburbs are divided into four zones; the northern suburbs (including [[Ekali]], [[Nea Erythraia|Nea Erythrea]], [[Agios Stefanos, Attica|Agios Stefanos]], [[Drosia]], [[Dionysus|Dionysos]], [[Kryoneri, Attica|Kryoneri]], [[Kifissia]], [[Marousi|Maroussi]], [[Pefki]], Lykovrisi, Heraklio, [[Glyka Nera]], [[Vrilissia]], [[Melissia]], [[Penteliko Mountain|Pendeli]], [[Chalandri|Halandri]], [[Agia Paraskevi|Aghia Paraskevi]], [[Psychiko]] and [[Filothei]]); the southern suburbs, (including Nea Smirni,[[Agios Dimitrios]], [[Palaio Faliro]], [[Ellinikon|Elliniko]], [[Glyfada]], [[Alimos]], [[Voula]] [[Argyroupoli]], [[Ilioupoli]] and the southernmost suburb of [[Vouliagmeni]]); the eastern suburbs, (including [[Acharnes]], [[Zografou]], [[Vyronas]], [[Kaisariani]], [[Cholargos]] and [[Papagou]]; and the western suburbs (including [[Peristeri]], [[Ilio, Greece|Ilion]], [[Egaleo]], [[Petroupoli]] and [[Nikaia, Attica|Nikaia]]).

The Athens city coastline, extending from the major commercial port of [[Piraeus]] to the southernmost suburb of [[Varkiza]] for some {{convert|25|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Greece_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Piraeus%20(Attiki)&amp;toplace=Varkiza%20(Piraios%20Nomos)&amp;fromlat=37.9474464019929&amp;tolat=37.8185988001751&amp;fromlng=23.6370849609375&amp;tolng=23.7987041473389 |title=Distance between Piraeus (Attiki) and Varkiza (Piraios Nomos) (Greece) |publisher=Distancecalculator.globefeed.com |date=9 December 2007 |accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also connected to the city centre by a [[tram]].

In the northern suburb of Maroussi, the upgraded main [[Athens Olympic Sports Complex|Olympic Complex]] (known by its Greek acronym OAKA) dominates the skyline. The whole area has been redeveloped according to a design by the Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], with steel arches, landscaped gardens, fountains, futuristic glass, and a landmark new blue glass roof which was added to the main stadium. A second Olympic complex, next to the sea at the beach of [[Kallithea]] (Faliron), also features modern stadia, shops and an elevated esplanade. Work is underway to transform the grounds of the old Athens Airport – named [[Ellinikon International Airport|Hellinikon]] – in the southern suburbs, into one of the largest landscaped parks in Europe, to be named the [[Hellenikon Metropolitan Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minenv.gr/hellenikon-competition/oa/en/main.htm |work=Hellenic Ministry of the Environment and Public Works |title=Hellenikon Metropolitan Park Competition |accessdate=3 January 2007 |publisher=www.minenv.gr}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the southern suburbs (such as [[Alimos]], [[Palaio Faliro]], [[Ellinikon|Elliniko]], [[Voula]], [[Vouliagmeni]] and [[Varkiza]]) host a number of sandy beaches, most of which are operated by the [[Greek National Tourism Organization|Greek National Tourism Organisation]] and require an entrance fee, which is not excessive in most cases. Casinos operate on both Mount Parnitha, some {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6252676.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Greek forest fire close to Athens |publisher=BBC News |date=29 June 2007 |accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; from downtown Athens, (accessible by car or cable car) and the nearby town of [[Loutraki]] (accessible by car via the Athens – [[Corinth]] National Highway, or the suburban railroad).

===Parks===
[[File:National park of Athens1.JPG|thumb|left|190px|The entrance of the [[National Garden of Athens|National Gardens]].]]
[[File:Panoramic views of Athens (Greece).jpg|thumb|Athens view from the Acropolis with the [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus hill]] at the background.]]

Parnitha National Park is punctuated by well-marked paths, gorges, springs, torrents and caves dotting the protected area. Hiking and mountain-biking in all four mountains remain popular outdoor activities for many residents of the city. The [[National Garden of Athens]] was completed in 1840 and is a green refuge of 15.5 hectares in the center of the Greek capital. It is to be found between the Parliament and [[Zappeion]] buildings, the latter of which maintains its own garden of seven hectares.

Parts of the city centre have been redeveloped under a masterplan called the ''Unification of Archeological Sites of Athens'', which has also gathered funding from the EU to help enhance the project.&lt;ref name=EUfund/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astynet.gr/ |title=Eaxa :: Ενοποιηση Αρχαιολογικων Χωρων Αθηνασ Α.Ε |publisher=Astynet.gr |accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark Dionysiou Aeropagitou street has been pedestrianised, forming a scenic route. The route starts from the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the Acropolis near [[Plaka]], and finishes just beyond the [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in [[Thiseio]]. The route in its entirety provides visitors with views of the [[Parthenon]] and the [[ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]] (the meeting point of ancient Athenians), away from the busy city centre.

The hills of Athens also provide green space. [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus]], [[Philopappos Monument|Philopappos hill]] and the area around it, including [[Pnyx]] and [[Ardettos hill]], are planted with pines and other trees, with the character of a small forest rather than typical metropolitan parkland. Also to be found is the [[Pedion tou Areos]] (''Field of Mars'') of 27.7 hectares, near [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]].

===Archaeological hub===
The city is one of the world's main centres of [[archaeology|archaeological research]]. Apart from national institutions, such as [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|Athens University]], the [[Archaeological Society of Athens|Archaeological Society]], several archaeological Museums (including the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]], the [[Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art|Cycladic Museum]], the [[Epigraphy|Epigraphic]] Museum, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Museum, as well as museums at the ancient [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]], [[Acropolis Museum|Acropolis]], and [[Kerameikos]]), the city is also home to the [[Democritus|Demokritos]] laboratory for [[Archaeological science|Archaeometry]] as well as several regional and national archaeological authorities that form part of the [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Greek Department of Culture]]. Additionally, Athens hosts 17 [[List of Foreign Archaeological Institutes in Greece|Foreign Archaeological Institutes]] which promote and facilitate research by scholars from their respective home countries. As a result, Athens has more than a dozen archaeological libraries and three specialized archaeological laboratories, and is the venue of several hundred specialized lectures, conferences and seminars, as well as dozens of archaeological exhibitions, per year. At any given time, Athens is the (temporary) home to hundreds of international scholars and researchers in all disciplines of archaeology.

The most important museums of Athens include: The [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]], the largest archaeological museum in the country, and one of the most important internationally, as it contains a vast collection of antiquities; its artifacts cover a period of more than 5,000 years, from late [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]] to [[Roman Greece]]; The [[Benaki Museum]] with its several branches for each of its collections including ancient, Byzantine, ottoman-era and Chinese art and beyond; The [[Byzantine &amp; Christian Museum|Byzantine and Christian Museum]], one of the most important museums of [[Byzantine art]]; The [[Numismatic Museum of Athens|Numismatic Museum]], housing a great collection of ancient and modern coins; The [[Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art|Museum of Cycladic Art]], home to an extensive collection of [[Cycladic art]], including the famous figurines made of white marble; and finally the [[Acropolis Museum|New Acropolis Museum]], opened in 2009, and replacing the old museum on the Acropolis. The new museum has proved considerably popular; almost one million people visited during the summer period June–October 2009 alone. A number of smaller and privately owned museums focused on Greek culture and arts are also to be found.

===Tourism===
Athens has been a popular [[tourist destination|destination]] for travelers since antiquity. Over the past decade, the city's infrastructure and social amenities have improved, in part due to its successful bid to stage the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]]. The Greek Government, aided by the [[European Union|EU]], has funded major infrastructure projects such as the state-of-the-art [[Athens International Airport|Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aia.gr/UserFiles/File/235956_Englishl.pdf |title=AIA: Finance |publisher=www.AIA.gr |work=Athens International Airport, S.A. |accessdate=5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the expansion of the [[Athens Metro]] system,&lt;ref name=EUfund&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/themes/olympe/pages/focus_en.htm |title=Olympic Games 2004: five major projects for Athens |publisher=ec.europa.eu |work=European Union Regional Policy |accessdate=5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new [[Attiki Odos]] Motorway.&lt;ref name=EUfund/&gt;

===Sports===
Athens has a long tradition in sports and sporting events, being home of the most important clubs in [[Sport in Greece|Greek sports]] and having a large number of sports facilities. The city has also served as a host of several sports events of international notability.

Athens has hosted the [[Summer Olympic Games]] twice, in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]. The 2004 Summer Olympics inspired the development of the [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]], which has since gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful stadia in the world, and one of its most interesting modern monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.athens-today.com/e-olimpica_stadio.htm |title=Athens 21st Century – Athens Olympic Stadium |accessdate=26 December 2008 |publisher=athens-today.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest stadium in the country, it has hosted two finals of the [[UEFA Champions League]], in [[1994 UEFA Champions League Final|1994]] and [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final|2007]]. The other major stadium of Athens, located in [[Piraeus]] area, is the [[Karaiskakis Stadium]], a state-of-the-art sports and entertainment complex, host of the [[1971 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1971 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final]]. Athens has hosted the [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]] final three times, the first in 1985 and second in [[FIBA European Championship 1992-93|1993]], both at the [[Peace and Friendship Stadium]], most known as SEF, one of the largest and most attractive indoor arenas in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.athens-today.com/e-olimpica_faliro.htm |title=Athens 21st Century – The Olympic Coastal Complex |accessdate=26 December 2008 |publisher=athens-today.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the third in [[Euroleague 2006-07|2007]] at the [[Olympic Indoor Hall]]. A large number of events in other sports such as [[Track and field athletics|athletics]], [[volleyball]], [[water polo]] etc., has also been hosted in the capital's venues.

Athens is home to three prestigious European multi-sport clubs: [[Olympiacos CFP|Olympiacos]], [[Panathinaikos]], [[Athletic Union of Constantinople|AEK Athens]]. In [[Association football|football]], [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] have dominated the domestic competitions, [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] made it to the [[1971 European Cup Final]], while [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] is the other member of the [[P.O.K.|big three]]. These clubs also hold prominent [[basketball]] departments; [[Panathinaikos BC|Panathinaikos]] and [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] are among the top powers in European basketball, having won the [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]] five times and once respectively, with [[AEK Athens B.C.|AEK Athens]] being the first Greek team to win a European trophy in any team sports. Other clubs with great tradition in sports within Athens are [[Panionios]], [[Panellinios G.S.|Panellinios]], [[Ethnikos Piraeus F.C.|Ethnikos Piraeus]] and [[Maroussi BC|Maroussi]]. Athenian clubs have also had significant domestic and international success in other sports.

The Athens area encompasses a variety of [[terrain]], notably hills and mountains rising around the city, and the capital is the only major city in Europe to be bisected by a [[mountain range]]. Four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries and thousands of miles of trails crisscross the city and neighbouring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access on [[hiking|foot]] and [[Mountain biking|bike]]. Beyond Athens and across the county a great variety of outdoor activities are available and popular, including [[skiing]], [[rock climbing]], [[hang gliding]] and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the [[Sierra Club]], which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.

==Demographics==
[[File:Population Density in Athens.PNG|thumb|Athens population distribution.]]

The municipality of Athens has an official population of 745,514&lt;ref name=population/&gt; with a metropolitan population of 3.2 million (population including the suburbs).&lt;ref name=population/&gt; The actual population, however, is believed to be higher, because during census-taking (carried out once every 10 years) some Athenian residents travel back to their birthplaces, and register as local citizens there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ta-nea.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=A&amp;f=16985&amp;m=N12&amp;aa=1 Ta Nea onLine] – Retrieved on 10 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting this uncertainty about population figures, various sources refer to a population of around 5 million people for Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1648444,00.html |title=Athens is Burning |publisher=www.time.com |last=Carassava |first=Anthee |work=Time Magazine 06-31 |accessdate=2 August 2007|date=31 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pop Sources&quot;&gt;[http://aiaeurope.org/events/2008/Athens/ Athens: Ecology + Environment + Architecture] quote: ''Modern Athens, a city which was laid out in the 1830’s as a garden city for 50,000 inhabitants, is home today for nearly 5 million people, almost half of the population of Greece.''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1436180.stm BBC News Europe] quote: ''The capital, with its population of five million,''&lt;br /&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/equal/data/document/etg2-suc6-cooperation.pdf Europa] quote: ''the metropolitan area of Athens contains over five million inhabitants.''&lt;br /&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQQ/is_8_40/ai_65171917 International Railway Journal, August, 2000] quote: ''The Athens urban area has a population of about five million''&lt;/ref&gt; Also unaccounted for is an undefined number of unregistered immigrants originating mainly from [[Albania]], other [[Eastern Europe]]an countries and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/document/53/0,2340,en_33873108_33873421_35062645_1_1_1_1,00.html |work=OECD |year=2005 |title=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development: Economic Survey of Greece 2005 |publisher=www.oecd.org |accessdate=6 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ce-review.org/99/21/vidali21.html |work=Central European Review |title=Central European Review: Living in a Policy Vacuum |publisher=www.ce-review.org |accessdate=6 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some 200,000 Muslims living in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5190256.stm Athens Muslims to get a mosque]&quot;, BBC News, July 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient site of the city is centred on the rocky hill of the acropolis. In ancient times the port of [[Piraeus]] was a separate city, but it has now been absorbed into greater Athens. The rapid expansion of the city (which continues even today) was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s, because of the transition of Greece from an agricultural to an [[Developed country|industrial nation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gto.gr/athens/athens/athens.html Greek Tourist Organizer] – Retrieved on 6 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion is now particularly toward the East and North East (a tendency greatly related to the new [[Athens International Airport|Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]] and the [[Attiki Odos]], the freeway that cuts across [[Attica]]). By this process Athens has engulfed many former suburbs and villages in Attica, and continues to do so. Throughout its long history, Athens has experienced many different population levels. The table below shows the historical population of Athens in recent times.

The Athens [[urban area]] consists of 55 municipalities, 48 of the Athens Prefecture and the 7 of the mainland Piraeus Prefecture. The second largest municipality of the urban area, after Athens city proper, is that of [[Piraeus]], with [[Peristeri]] and [[Kallithea]] following. It spans {{convert|412|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=area/&gt; and has a population of 3,130,841 (in 2001),&lt;ref name=population/&gt; which makes it one of the [[Largest urban areas of the European Union|largest urban areas]] of the [[European Union]].

==Education==
[[File:Propylea-athens.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Propylaea'', part of the “Trilogy” of [[Theofil Hansen]], serves as the ceremony hall and rectory of the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]].]]
[[File:National library of greece athens.jpg|thumb|The entrance of the [[National Library of Greece]].]]

Located on [[Panepistimiou Street]], the old campus of the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]], the [[National Library of Greece|National Library]], and the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]] form the &quot;Athens Trilogy&quot; built in the mid-19th century. Most of the university's workings have been moved to a much larger, modern campus located in the eastern suburb of [[Zografou]]. The second higher education institution in the city is the [[National Technical University of Athens|Athens Polytechnic School]], found in Patission Street. This was the location where on 17 November 1973, more than 13 students were killed and hundreds injured inside the university during the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/25/newsid_2546000/2546297.stm |title=1973: Army deposes 'hated' Greek president |work=BBC News |accessdate=22 March 2009|date=25 November 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|military junta]] that ruled the nation from 21 April 1967 until [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|23 July 1974]]. Another notable institution in Patission Street is the [[Athens University of Economics and Business]], which is the oldest business school in Greece and the [[Agricultural University of Athens]] which lies at the west of city's center.

==Environment==
[[File:Athens recycling plateia-kotzia.JPG|thumb|left|Recycling machine in Athens.]]

By the late 1970s, the pollution of Athens had become so destructive that according to the then Greek [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Minister of Culture]], Constantine Trypanis, &quot;''...the carved details on the five the caryatids of the Erechtheum had seriously degenerated, while the face of the horseman on the Parthenon's west side was all but obliterated.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918645,00.html |title=Acropolis: Threat of Destruction |publisher=Time.com |work=Time Magazine |date=31 January 1977 |accessdate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of strict measures taken by the authorities of the city throughout the 1990s resulted in the improvement of air quality; the appearance of smog (or ''nefos'' as the Athenians used to call it) has become less common.
Widespread measures taken by the Greek authorities throughout the 1990s have improved the quality of air over the Attica Basin. Nevertheless, air pollution still remains an issue for Athens, particularly during the hottest summer days. In late June 2007,&lt;ref name=outraged&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/07/16/news/greece.php |title=As forest fires burn, suffocated Athens is outraged |first=Niki |last=Kitsantonis |date=16 July 2007 |accessdate=3 February 2008 |work=International Herald Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Attica]] region experienced a number of [[2007 Greek forest fires|brush fires]],&lt;ref name=outraged/&gt; including a blaze that burned a significant portion of a large forested national park in [[Parnitha|Mount Parnitha]],&lt;ref name=ypexode&gt;{{cite press release |title=Συνέντευξη Τύπου Γ.

The major waste management efforts undertaken in the last decade (particularly the plant built on the small island of Psytalia) have improved [[water quality]] in the Saronic Gulf, and the coastal waters of Athens are now accessible again to swimmers. In January 2007, Athens faced a waste management problem when its [[landfill]] near [[Ano Liosia]], an Athenian suburb, reached capacity.&lt;ref name=overflow&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/819945/rot_sets_in_as_athenss_trash_problem_mounts/index.html |title=Rot sets in as Athens's trash problem mounts |date=30 January 2007 |accessdate=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis eased by mid-January when authorities began taking the garbage to a temporary landfill.&lt;ref name=overflow/&gt;

The [[Athens Mass Transit System]] consists of a large bus fleet, a [[trolleybus]] fleet that mainly serves the downtown area, the city's Metro, a [[tram]] line connecting the southern suburbs to the city centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tramsa.gr/index.cfm?page_id=192&amp;category=learn&amp;lang_id=1 |title=Tram Sa |publisher=Tramsa.gr |accessdate=5 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Athens [[Regional rail|Suburban Railway]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proastiakos.gr |title=Προαστιακός |publisher=Proastiakos.gr |accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athens Metro===
The [[Athens Metro]] is more commonly known in Greece as the Attiko Metro ({{lang-el|Αττικό Mετρό}}). While its main purpose is transport, it also houses Greek artifacts found during construction of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culture.gr/2/21/211/21103a/e211ca09.html |work=Hellenic Ministry of Culture |title=Athens Metro |accessdate=26 January 2007 |publisher=www.culture.gr |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061207072925/http://www.culture.gr/2/21/211/21103a/e211ca09.html |archivedate = 7 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Athens Metro supports an operating staff of 387 and runs two of the three metro lines;&lt;ref name=xyz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oasa.gr/pdf/FactsAndFigures_en.pdf |title=Athens Urban Transport Network in Facts and Figures (pdf) page 15 |accessdate=4 February 2007 |work=OASA |publisher=www.oasa.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; its two lines (red and blue) were constructed largely during the 1990s, and the initial sections opened in January 2000, and the lines run entirely underground. The metro network operates a fleet of 42 trains consisting of 252 cars,&lt;ref name=xyz/&gt; with a daily occupancy of 550,000 passengers.&lt;ref name=xyz/&gt; The Blue Line runs from the western suburbs, namely the [[Egaleo]] station, through the central [[Monastiraki]] and Syntagma stations to [[Doukissis Plakentias station|Doukissis Plakentias]] avenue in the northeastern suburb of [[Chalandri|Halandri]], covering a distance of {{convert|16|km|mi|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=xyz/&gt; then ascending to ground level and reaching [[Athens International Airport|Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]], using the Suburban Railway infrastructure and extending its distance to {{convert|39|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=xyz/&gt; The Red Line, in counterpart, runs from [[Aghios Antonios station|Aghios Antonios]] to [[Agios Dimitrios|Aghios Dimitrios]] and covers a distance of {{convert|11.6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=xyz/&gt; Extensions to both these lines are under construction, most notably westwards to [[Piraeus]], southwards to the [[Ellinikon International Airport|Old Hellinikon Airport East Terminal]] (the future [[Hellenikon Metropolitan Park|Metropolitan Park]]), and eastward toward the easternmost suburb of [[Agia Paraskevi|Aghia Paraskevi]]. The eastern part is actually no extension per se, but rather an opening of new stations between the [[Ethniki Amyna station|Ethniki Amyna]] and Doukissis Plakentias stations. The spring 2007 extension from Monastiraki westwards, to [[Egaleo]], connected some of the main [[Nightlife|night life]] hubs of the city, namely the ones of Gazi ([[Kerameikos]] station) with Psirri (Monastiraki station) and the city centre ([[Syntagma station]]).

The third line, not run by the Athens Metro, is the ISAP ({{lang-el|ΗΣΑΠ}}), the ''Electric Railway Company''. This is the Green line of the Athens Metro as shown on the adjacent map, and unlike the red and blue routes running entirely underground, ISAP runs either above-ground or below-ground at different sections of its journey.

Its network consists of about 300 bus lines which span the entire Attica Basin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oasa.gr/pdf/FactsAndFigures_en.pdf |title=Athens Urban Transport Network in Facts and Figures (pdf) page 5 |accessdate=28 January 2007 |work=OASA |publisher=www.oasa.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an operating staff of 5,327, and a fleet of 1,839 buses.&lt;ref name=AB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oasa.gr/pdf/FactsAndFigures_en.pdf |title=Athens Urban Transport Network in Facts and Figures (pdf) page 6 |accessdate=28 January 2007 |work=OASA |publisher=www.oasa.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those 1,839 buses 416 run on [[compressed natural gas]],&lt;ref name=AB/&gt; making up the largest fleet of natural gas-powered buses in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New, Post-Olympics Athens |url=http://www.minpress.gr/minpress/aboutbrandgreece_low-res-9-tatsiopoulos.pdf |accessdate=23 August 2008 |page=79 |author=Ilias Tatsiopoulos &amp; Georgios Tziralis |work=www.minpress.gr |publisher=Secretariat General of Communication – Secretariat General of Information |format=PDF}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being served by a fleet of natural-gas and [[diesel engine|diesel]] buses, the Athens metropolitan area is also served by [[trolleybus]]es — or electric buses, as they are referred to in the name of the operating company. The network operated by ''Electric Buses of the Athens and [[Piraeus|Pireaus]] Region'', or [[ILPAP]] ({{lang-el|ΗΛΠΑΠ}}), consists of 22 lines with an operating staff of 1,137.&lt;ref name=CD&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oasa.gr/pdf/FactsAndFigures_en.pdf |title=Athens Urban Transport Network in Facts and Figures (pdf) page 11 |accessdate=28 January 2007 |work=OASA |publisher=www.oasa.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the 366 trolleybuses are equipped to enable them to run on diesel in case of [[power outage|power failure]].&lt;ref name=CD/&gt;

===Tram===
[[File:Tramway Athènes.JPG|thumb|right|[[Athens Tram]].]]

[[Athens Tram SA]] operates a fleet of 35 vehicles,&lt;ref name=athenstram&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tramsa.gr/index.cfm?page_id=207&amp;category=learn&amp;lang_id=1 |title=Tram Sa |publisher=Tramsa.gr |accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which serve 48 stations,&lt;ref name=athenstram/&gt; employ 345 people with an average daily occupancy of 65,000 passengers.&lt;ref name=athenstram/&gt; The tram network spans a total length of {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} and covers ten Athenian suburbs.&lt;ref name=athenstram/&gt; This network runs from [[Syntagma Square]] to the southwestern suburb of [[Palaio Faliro]], where the line splits in two branches; the first runs along the Athens coastline toward the southern suburb of [[Voula]], while the other heads toward the [[Piraeus]] district of Neo Faliro.

===Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport===
[[File:Athens airport tower 2008.jpg|thumb|Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport Control tower.]]

Athens is served by the state-of-the-art [[Athens International Airport|Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]] (AIA) located near the town of [[Spata]], in the eastern Messoghia plain, some {{convert|35|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of Athens.&lt;ref name=aia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aia.gr/contact.asp?langid=2 |title=Athens International Airport: Facts and Figures |accessdate=11 February 2007 |work=Athens International Airport |publisher=www.aia.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport was awarded the &quot;European Airport of the Year 2004&quot; Award.&lt;ref name=pro/&gt; Intended as an expandable hub for air travel in [[Balkans|southeastern Europe]], it was constructed in a record 51 months costing 2.2 billion euros, and employing a staff of 14,000.&lt;ref name=pro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aia.gr/pages.asp?pageid=15&amp;langid=2 |title=Athens International Airport: Airport Profile |accessdate=11 February 2007 |work=Athens International Airport |publisher=www.aia.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; An express bus service is provided, connecting the airport to the metro system, and 2 express bus services connect the airport to the port at [[Piraeus]] and the city centre respectively.

===Railways, highways and ferry connections===
Athens is the hub of the [[Hellenic Railways Organisation|country's national railway system]] (OSE), connecting the capital with major cities across Greece and abroad ([[Istanbul]], [[Sofia]], and [[Bucharest]]). Ferries departing from the major port of [[Piraeus]] connect the city to the numerous [[List of islands of Greece|Greek islands]] of the [[Aegean Sea]]. There are two main highways; one heading towards the western city of Patras in [[Peloponnese|Peloponessus]] ([[Greek National Road 8A|GR-8A]], [[European route E94|E94]]) and the other heading to the north, towards Greece's second largest city, [[Thessaloniki]] ([[Greek National Road 1|GR-1]], [[European route E75|E75]]). From 2001 to 2004, a ring road toll-motorway (Attiki Odos) was gradually completed, extending from the western industrial suburb of [[Eleusina|Elefsina]] all the way to the [[Athens International Airport]]. The [[Ymittos]] Periphery Highway is a separate section of [[Attiki Odos]] connecting the eastern suburb of [[Kaisariani]] to the northeastern town of [[Glyka Nera]]; this is where it meets the main part of the [[Beltway|ring road]]. The span of the Attiki Odos in all is {{convert|65|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aodos.gr/article.asp?catid=12069&amp;tag=7275 Aodos.gr]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Olympic Games==
[[File:Athens 1896 report cover.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Poster of [[1896 Summer Olympics]].]]

===1896 Summer Olympics===
{{Main|1896 Summer Olympics}}
[[File:Louis entering Kallimarmaron at the 1896 Athens Olympics.jpg|thumb|[[Spyridon Louis]] entering the [[Kallimarmaron Stadium]] at the end of the marathon.]]

1896 brought forth the revival of the modern Olympic Games, by Frenchman [[Pierre de Coubertin]]. Thanks to his efforts, Athens was awarded the first modern Olympic Games. In 1896, the city had an approximate population of 123,000&lt;ref name=tung2/&gt; and the event helped boost the city's international profile. Of the venues used for these Olympics, the [[Kallimarmaro]] Stadium, and [[Zappeion]] were most crucial. The Kallimarmaro is a replica of the ancient Athenian stadiums, and the only major stadium (in its capacity of 60,000) to be made entirely of white marble from Mount [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]], the same material used for construction of the [[Parthenon]].

===1906 Summer Olympics===
The [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Summer Olympics]], or the 1906 Intercalated games, were held very successfully in Athens. The intercalated competitions were intermediate games to the internationally organized [[Olympic Games|olympics]], and were meant to be organized in Greece. This idea later lost support from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] and these games were not made permanent.

===2004 Summer Olympics===
{{Main|2004 Summer Olympics}}
[[File:Athens archery.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Archery matches in [[Kallimarmaron Stadium]] during the 2004 Olympic Games.]]

Athens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], after having lost a previous bid to host the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], to [[Atlanta]], United States.&lt;ref name = oly/&gt; It was to be the second time Athens would have the honour of hosting the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41.&lt;ref name = oly/&gt; Prior to this round, the cities of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Cape Town]] had already been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.&lt;ref name = oly/&gt;

[[File:Olympic flame at opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|The [[Olympic Flame]] at the opening ceremony of the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]], conceived by the avant-garde choreographer [[Dimitris Papaioannou]].]]

During the first three years of preparations, the [[International Olympic Committee]] had repeatedly expressed some concern over the speed of construction progress for some of the new Olympic venues. In 2000 the Organising Committee's president was replaced by [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]], who was the president of the original Bidding Committee in 1997. From that point on, preparations continued at a highly accelerated, almost frenzied pace.

Although the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5 billion, as is usually the case with most Olympic cities, Athens was literally transformed into a more functional city that enjoys state-of-the-art technology both in transportation and in modern [[urban planning|urban development]].&lt;ref name = olyy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/29/closing.ceremony/ |title=Athens bids farewell to the Games |date=30 August 2004 |accessdate=29 March 2007 |work=CNN |publisher=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the finest sporting venues in the world were created in the city, all of which were fully ready for the games. The games welcomed over 10,000 athletes from all 202 countries.&lt;ref name = olyy/&gt; The 2004 Games were judged a huge success, as both security and organization were exceptionally good, and only a few visitors reported minor problems mainly concerning accommodation issues. The 2004 Olympic Games were described as ''Unforgettable, dream Games'', by IOC President [[Jacques Rogge]] for their return to the birthplace of the Olympics, and for superbly meeting the challenges of holding the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name = olyy/&gt; The only observable problem was a somewhat sparse attendance of some early events. Eventually, however, a total of more than 3.5 million tickets were sold, which was higher than any other Olympics with the exception of [[Sydney]] (more than 5 million tickets were sold there in 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&amp;folder=200&amp;article=13956 |date=27 August 2004 |accessdate=30 March 2007 |title=Olympic ticket sales officially top 3.5-million mark |publisher=Embassy of Greece |author=Athens News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 it was reported that almost all of the Olympic venues had fallen into varying states of disrepair: according to those reports, 21 of the 22 facilities built for the games had either been left abandoned or are in a state of dereliction, with several [[squatting|squatter]] camps having sprung up around certain facilities, and a number of venues afflicted by [[vandalism]], graffiti or strewn with rubbish.&lt;ref name=malone&gt;{{cite news |last=Malone |first=Andrew |title=Abandoned, derelict, covered in graffiti and rubbish: what is left of Athens' £9billion Olympic 'glory' |publisher=The Daily Mail |date=18 July 2008 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1036373/Abandoned-derelict-covered-graffiti-rubbish-What-left-Athens-9billion-Olympic-glory.html |accessdate=25 August 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yahoo08&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=Martin |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/news;_ylt=AjpTiz9CDw7_QtyFTlFMB0uVTZd4?slug=ro-beijinglegacy082408&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=Beijing trumps Athens ... and then some |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=csm&gt;{{cite web|last=Itano |first=Nicole |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0721/p04s01-wogn.html |title=As Olympic Glow Fades, Athens Questions $15 Billion Cost |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims, however, are disputed and likely to be inaccurate, as most of the facilities used for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens Olympics]] are either in use or in the process of being converted for post-Olympics use. The Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/features/after-the-party-what-happens-when-the-olympics-leave-town-901629.html |title=After The Party: What happens when the Olympics leave town |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date= 19 August 2008|accessdate=21 March 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other facilities are still in use just as during the Olympics, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jul 30, 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAognIFQaNRhGk_sG9fHJQHVXuHw |title=Four years after Athens Greeks have Olympics blues |publisher=Afp.google.com |date=30 July 2008 |accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anguilla''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|æ|ŋ|ˈ|ɡ|w|ɪ|l|ə}} {{respell|ang|GWIL|ə}}) is a [[British overseas territories|British overseas territory]] in the [[Caribbean]], one of the most northerly of the [[Leeward Islands]] in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It consists of the main island of Anguilla itself, approximately {{convert|26|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} long by {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} wide at its widest point, together with a number of much smaller islands and [[cay]]s with no permanent population. The island's capital is [[The Valley, Anguilla|The Valley]]. The total land area of the territory is {{convert|91|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|lk=off}},&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact92/wf930012.txt&lt;/ref&gt; with a population of approximately 13,500 (2006 estimate).
It lies east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]] and directly north of [[Saint Martin]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Anguilla}}
Anguilla was first settled by [[Amerindian]] tribes who migrated from [[South America]]. The earliest Amerindian artifacts found on Anguilla have been dated to around 1300 BC, and remains of settlements date from 600 AD.&lt;ref&gt;''Caribbean Islands'', Sarah Cameron (Footprint Travel Guides), p. 466 ([http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G74-rZzX64cC Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt; The date of European discovery is uncertain: some sources claim that [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] sighted the island in 1493, while others state that the island was first discovered by the French in 1564 or 1565.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ai/elections/anguillahistory.htm Anguilla's History], Government of Anguilla website&lt;/ref&gt; The name Anguilla derives from the word for &quot;eel&quot; in any of various [[Romance language]]s (modern Spanish: ''{{lang|es|anguila}}''; French: ''{{lang|fr|anguille}}''; Italian: ''{{lang|it|anguilla}}''), probably chosen because of the island's eel-like shape.

Anguilla was first colonised by [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlers from [[Saint Kitts]], beginning in 1650.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Historical Geography of the British Colonies: The West Indies|author=Charles Prestwood Lucas|pages=143|isbn=978-1459008687|publisher=General Books LLC|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French temporarily took over the island in 1666 but under the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] it was returned to English control. In this early colonial period Anguilla sometimes served as a place of refuge. A Major John Scott who visited in September of 1667 wrote of leaving the island &quot;in good condition&quot; and noted that in July 1668 &quot;200 or 300 people fled thither in time of war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;British Colonial and State Papers 1661-1668, November 16, 1667 and July 9, 1668.&lt;/ref&gt; Other early arrivals included [[Europe]]ans from [[Antigua]] and [[Barbados]]. It is likely that some of these early Europeans brought enslaved [[Africa]]ns with them. Historians confirm that [[atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] lived in the region in the early 17th century. For example, Africans from [[Senegal]] lived in St. Christopher (today St. Kitts) in 1626. By 1672 a slave depot existed on the island of Nevis, serving the [[Leeward Islands]]. While the time of African arrival in Anguilla is difficult to place precisely, archival evidence indicates a substantial African presence (at least 100) on the island by 1683.

While traditional histories of the region assume that &quot;the English&quot; were the first settlers of Anguilla under British rule, recent scholarship focused on Anguilla offers a more nuanced view. It emphasizes the significance of early sociocultural diversity. This research suggests that St. Christopher,&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, V.O.  1998.  St. Kitts:  The Launching Pad for Leeward Islands Creoles.  In St.  Kitts and the Atlantic Creoles, the Texts of Samuel Augustus Mathews in Perspective, P. Baker and A. Bruyn (eds.).  London:  University of Westminister Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Barbados, Nevis and Antigua are all significant points of origin.  Regarding African origins, West Africa as well as Central Africa are both posited as the ancestral homelands of some of Anguilla's early African population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walicek, Don E 2009. pp. 349-372&quot;&gt;Walicek, Don E.  2009.  &quot;The Founder Principle and Anguilla's Homestead Society,&quot; Gradual Creolization: Studies Celebrating Jacques Arends, ed. by M. van den Berg, H. Cardoso, and R. Selbach.  (Creole Language Library Series 34), Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 349-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early colonial period, Anguilla was administered by the British through [[Antigua]], but in 1824 it was placed under the administrative control of nearby [[Saint Kitts]]. In 1967, Britain granted Saint Kitts and [[Nevis]] full internal autonomy, and Anguilla was also incorporated into the new unified dependency, named [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]], against the wishes of many Anguillians. This led to two rebellions in 1967 and 1969 ([[Anguillian Revolution]]), headed by [[Ronald Webster]], and a brief period as a self-declared independent republic. British authority was fully restored in July, 1971. In 1980 Anguilla was finally allowed to secede from Saint Kitts and Nevis and become a separate British colony (now termed a [[British overseas territory]]).

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Anguilla}}
{{See also|Law of Anguilla}}

Anguilla is an internally self-governing [[British overseas territory|overseas territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. Its politics take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Dependent territory|dependency]], whereby the [[Chief Minister]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[wiktionary:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.

The [[United Nations Committee on Decolonization]] includes Anguilla on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]]. The territory's constitution is Anguilla Constitutional Order 1 April 1982 (amended 1990). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[Anguilla House of Assembly|House of Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. &lt;br clear=left&gt;

===Military===
As a [[dependent territory|dependency]] of the UK, the UK is responsible for its military defence, although there are no active [[garrison]] or armed forces present.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Anguilla}}

[[File:Anguilla-aerial view western portion.jpg|thumb|400px|right|An aerial view of the western portion of the island of Anguilla. The Blowing Point ferry terminal is visible in the lower right, as are (right to left) Shaddick Point, Rendezvous Bay, Cove Bay, and Maundays Bay.]]

Anguilla is a flat, low-lying island of [[coral]] and [[limestone]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands]]. It is directly north of [[Saint Martin]], separated from that island by the [[Anguilla Channel]]. The [[soil]] is generally thin and poor, supporting only [[scrubland|scrub]] vegetation.

Anguilla is noted for its spectacular and ecologically important [[coral reef]]s and beaches. Apart from the main island of Anguilla itself, the territory includes a number of other smaller islands and [[cays]], mostly tiny and uninhabited. Some of these are:
* [[Anguillita]]
* [[Dog Island, Anguilla|Dog Island]]
* [[Prickly Pear Cays]]
* [[Sandy Island, Anguilla|Sandy Island]]
* [[Scrub Island, Anguilla|Scrub Island]]
* [[Scilly Cay, Anguilla|Scilly Cay]]
* [[Seal Island, Anguilla|Seal Island]]
* [[Sombrero, Anguilla|Sombrero]], also known as Hat Island

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Anguilla}}

===Temperature===
Northeastern trade winds keep this tropical island relatively cool and dry. Average annual temperature is {{convert|27|°C|1}}. July–October is its hottest period, December–February, its coolest.

===Rainfall===
Rainfall averages {{convert|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} annually, although the figures vary from season to season and year to year. The island is subject to both sudden tropical storms and hurricanes, which occur in the period from July to October. The island suffered damage in 1995 from [[Hurricane Luis]].

==Economy==
[[File:Sandy Ground Anguilla.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Overlooking [[Sandy Ground, Anguilla|Sandy Ground]], Anguilla.]]

{{Main|Economy of Anguilla}}
Anguilla's thin arid soil is largely unsuitable for agriculture, and the island has few land-based [[natural resources]]. Its main industries are tourism, [[offshore companies|offshore incorporation and management]], [[offshore bank]]ing, and fishing. Many insurance and financial business are headquartered in Anguilla.

The economy of Anguilla is falling with the highest speed in the World as a result of the 2008- World crisis.

Before that the economy of Anguilla was expanding rapidly, especially the tourism sector which was driving major new developments in partnerships with multi-national companies.

Anguilla's currency is the [[East Caribbean dollar]], though the [[US dollar]] is also widely accepted. The exchange rate is fixed to the US dollar at US$1 = EC$2.68.

The economy, and especially the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the effects of [[Hurricane Luis]] in September but recovered in 1996. Hotels were hit particularly hard during this time. Another economic setback occurred during the aftermath of [[Hurricane Lenny]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=South America, Central America and the Caribbean 2003|publisher=Routledge|pages=52|year=2002|isbn=978-1857431384|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transport in Anguilla}}

Anguilla is served by [[Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport]] (prior to 4 July 2010 known as Wallblake Airport). The primary runway at the airport is {{convert|5462|ft|m}} in length and can accommodate moderate-sized aircraft. Services connect to various other Caribbean islands via regional carrier [[LIAT]], local charter airlines and others; and although there are no direct scheduled flights to or from continental America or Europe the airport can handle large [[narrow-body]] jets such as the [[Boeing 737]] and [[Boeing 757]] .
Regular ferries link Anguilla and the neighboring island of [[Saint Martin]], with a journey time of about twenty minutes.

Aside from taxis, there is no public transport on the island. Cars drive on the left.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Anguilla}}
The majority of residents (90.08%) are black, the descendants of slaves transported from Africa. Growing minorities include whites at 3.74% and people of mixed race at 4.65% (figures from 2001 census).

72% of the population is Anguillian while 28% is non-Anguillian (2001 census). Of the non-Anguillian population, many are citizens of the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[St Kitts &amp; Nevis]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Nigeria]].

2006 and 2007 saw an influx of large numbers of [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[India]]n, and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] workers, brought in as labour for major tourist developments due to the local population not being large enough to support the labour requirements.

==Culture==
[[File:Cap Juluca - Anguilla.jpg|thumb|right|The beach at the Cap Juluca resort on Maundays Bay.]]
[[File:Anguilla-Island Harbour.jpg|thumb|right|Island Harbour]]
The [[Anguilla National Trust]] (ANT) was established in 1988 and opened its offices in 1993 charged with the responsibility of preserving the heritage of the island, including its cultural heritage. The Trust has programmes encouraging Anguillian writers and the preservation of the island's history.

The island's cultural history begins with the [[Taíno people|Taino]] Indians. Artifacts have been found around the island, telling of life before European settlers arrived.

As throughout the [[Caribbean]], holidays are a cultural fixture. Anguilla's most important holidays are of historic as much as cultural importance &amp;ndash; particularly the anniversary of the emancipation (previously August Monday in the Park), celebrated as the Summer Festival. [[United Kingdom|British]] festivities, such as the [[Queen's Official Birthday|Queen's birthday]], are also celebrated.

===Religion===
According to the 2001 census [[Christianity]] is Anguilla's predominant religion, with 29 percent of the population practising [[Anglicanism]]. Another 23.9 percent are [[Methodist]]. Other churches on the island include [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Baptist]], [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (0.7%).&lt;ref name=&quot;statistics census&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.ai/statistics/census/Demography%20&amp;%20Culture%20tables.htm|title=Persons by Religion, Census 1992 and 2001 (Table 14)|publisher=Statistics Department of Anguilla|accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1992 and 2001 the number of followers of the [[Church of God]]{{dn}} and [[Pentecostal Churches]] increased considerably. There are at least 15 churches on the island, several of architectural interest. Although a minority on the island, it is an important location to followers of [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] religion – Anguilla is the birthplace of [[Robert Athlyi Rogers]], author of [[Holy Piby|The Holy Piby]] which has had a strong influence on Rastafarian beliefs. Various other religions are practised as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;statistics census&quot;/&gt;

===Language===
{{Main|Anguillan Creole}}
Today most people in Anguilla speak a British-influenced variety of &quot;Standard&quot; English. Other languages are also spoken on the island, including varieties of Spanish, Chinese and the languages of other immigrants. However, the most common language other than Standard English is the island's own English-lexifier Creole language (not to be confused with French Creole spoken in islands such as Haiti, Martinique, and Guadeloupe). It is referred to locally by terms such as &quot;dialect&quot; (pronounced &quot;dialek&quot;), or &quot;Anguillian&quot;. It has its main roots in early varieties of English and West African languages, and is similar to the dialects spoken in English-speaking islands throughout the Eastern Caribbean.

Linguists who are interested in the origins of Anguillian and other Caribbean Creoles point out that some of its grammatical features can be traced to African languages while others can be traced to European languages. In order to understand how this works it is useful to remember that grammatical &quot;features&quot; consists of much more than words (i.e., lexical items). It is possible that different aspects of this language have different origins and influences. The aspects that should be considered in understanding the history of the grammar of this language are at least 5: semantics (meaning); phonology (the system of consonants and vowels characteristic of a given language), syntax (word order), and morphology (rules for forming words).

What language are these early Africans likely to have spoken? Three areas have been identified as significant for the identification of the linguistic origins of those forced migrants who arrived before 1710: the Gold Coast, the Slave Coast, and the Windward Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Singler, John.  1993.  African influence upon Afro-American language varieties: A consideration of sociohistorical factors.  In Africanisms in Afro-American language varieties, S. Mufwene and n. Condon (eds.), 235-253.  Athens, GA:  University of Georgia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociohistorical information from Anguilla's archives suggest that Africans and Europeans formed two distinct, but perhaps overlapping speech communities in the early phases of the island's colonization. &quot;Anguillian&quot; is believed to have emerged as the language of the masses as time passed, slavery was abolished, and locals began to see themselves as &quot;belonging&quot; to Anguillian society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walicek, Don E 2009. pp. 349-372&quot;/&gt;

===Sport===
[[File:Sailing-in-anguilla.jpg|thumb|right|A modern [[square rigger]] viewed from Long Bay]]
{{See also|Sailing in Anguilla|Cricket in the West Indies|Rugby union in Anguilla}}

[[Boat racing]]{{dn}} has deep roots in Anguillian culture, and is the [[national sport]]. There are regular sailing [[regattas]] on national holidays, such as Carnival, which are contested by locally built and designed boats. These boats have names and have sponsors that print their logo on their sails.

As in many other former [[British Colony|British Colonies]], [[cricket]] is also a popular sport. Anguilla is the home of [[Omari Banks]], who played for the [[West Indies Cricket Team]], while [[Cardigan Connor]] played first-class cricket for English county side [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] and was 'chef de mission' (team manager) for Anguilla's [[Commonwealth Games]] team in 2002.

[[Rugby union]] is represented in Anguilla by the Anguilla Eels RFC, who were formed in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.ai/gl//article.php?story=20060425160749670 Rugby in Anguilla!], Anguilla News&lt;/ref&gt; The Eels have been finalists in the St. Martin tournament in November 2006 and semi finalists in 2007, 2008, 2009 and Champions in 2010. The Eels were formed in 2006 by Scottish club national second row Martin Welsh, Club Sponsor and President of the AERFC Ms Jacquie Ruan, and Canadian standout Scrumhalf Mark Harris (Toronto Scottish RFC). The club was lucky enough to host the HMS Iron Duke in September 2008 which saw a very spirited game going to the visitors 18-13.  The St Barts Barracudas have also been to Anguilla to play the Eels also prevailing 11 points to 6.

The '''Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands''' are two groups of small low-lying uninhabited tropical islands in the Indian Ocean situated on the edge of the [[continental shelf]] north-west of Australia and south of the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Rote Island|Rote]].

==Geography==
The territory includes Ashmore Reef (West, Middle, and [[East Island (Ashmore and Cartier Islands)|East]] Islets) and [[Cartier Islands|Cartier Island]] (70&amp;nbsp;km east) with, a total area of {{convert|199.45|km²|0|abbr=on}} within the [[reef]]s and including the [[lagoons]], and 114,400 m² of dry land. While they have a total of {{convert|74.1|km|0|abbr=on}} of shoreline, measured along the outer edge of the reef, there are no ports or harbors, only offshore anchorage.

Nearby Hibernia Reef, {{convert|42|km|0|abbr=on}} Northeast of Ashmore Reef, is not part of the territory, but belongs to Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statoids.com/uau.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has no permanently dry land area, although large parts of the reef become exposed during low tide.

Cartier Island Marine Reserve includes the entire sand cay of Cartier Island, the reef surrounding it, the ocean for a {{convert|7.2|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} radius around the island, and {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the seafloor. It was proclaimed in 2000.

*Ashmore Reef {{convert|155.40|km²|0|abbr=on}} area within reef (including lagoon)
**West Islet, 51,200 m² land area;
**Middle Islet, 21,200 m² land area;
**East Islet, 25,000 m² land area;
*Cartier Reef (44.03&amp;nbsp;km² area within reef (including lagoon)
**Cartier Island, 17,000 m² land area;

There is an automatic weather station on West Islet.

==Government==
The territory is administered from Canberra by the [[Attorney-General's Department]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AussieAG&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| author =  First Assistant Secretary, Territories Division | title = Territories of Australia | url = http://www.ag.gov.au/territories | publisher= Attorney-General's Department | date= 2008-01-30 | accessdate = 2008-02-07 | quote = The Federal Government, through the Attorney-General's Department administers Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Coral Sea Islands, Jervis Bay, and Norfolk Island as Territories. }}&lt;/ref&gt; (before 29 November 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;DOTARS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| author =  Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government | title = Territories of Australia | url = http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/territories/index.aspx | accessdate = 2008-02-07 | quote = As part of the Machinery of Government Changes following the Federal Election on 29 November 2007, administrative responsibility for Territories has been transferred to the Attorney General's Department. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071216154140/http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/territories/index.aspx &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; administration was carried out by the [[Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (Australia)|Department of Transport and Regional Services]]).  The FIPS-10 date code is &lt;tt&gt;AT&lt;/tt&gt;; the territory is bundled along with Australia in [[ISO 3166]].  Defence is the responsibility of Australia, with periodic visits by the [[Royal Australian Navy]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]]. The islands are visited by seasonal caretakers.

Ashmore Reef is called ''Pulau Pasir'' by Indonesians, and considered part of [[Rote Ndao Regency]] of [[East Nusa Tenggara]] province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/5889136/Pulau_Pasir_Kabupaten_Rote_Ndao_district_Nusa_tenggara_Timur_province_INDONESIA Ashmore Reef, Ashmore and Cartier Islands (external territory of Australia)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Rote Island]] language, it is called ''Nusa Solokaek''. Both names have the meaning Sand Island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspas.anu.edu.au/people/personal/foxxj_rspas/Fishermen_MOU_BOX.pdf The Settlement of Papela&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 2002 the nature reserve was recognised as a wetland of international importance when it was designated Ramsar Site 1220 under the [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar Convention on Wetlands]].&lt;ref name=ARL&gt;Annotated Ramsar List.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology and environment==
{{See also|Birds of Ashmore Reef}}
{{Main|Flora of Ashmore and Cartier Islands}}

[[Image:Cartier Island.png|thumb|right|Cartier Island and surrounding reef ([[NASA]] satellite image)]]
The Ashmore Reef Marine National Nature Reserve was established in August 1983. It is of significant [[biodiversity]] value as it is in the flow of the [[Indonesian Throughflow]] ocean current from the Pacific Ocean through the [[Malay archipelago]] to the Indian Ocean. It is also in a surface current west from the [[Arafura Sea]] and [[Timor Sea]].

The Reserve comprises several marine habitats, including seagrass meadows, intertidal sand flats, coral reef flats, and lagoons, and supports an important and diverse range of species, including 14 species of [[sea snake]]s, a population of [[Dugong]] that may be genetically distinct, a diverse [[marine invertebrate]] fauna, and many [[endemism|endemic]] species, especially of sea snakes and [[mollusc]]s. There are feeding and nesting sites for [[Loggerhead Turtle|Loggerhead]], [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green Turtle]]s.  It is classified as an [[Important Bird Area]]  and has 50,000 breeding pairs of various kinds of [[seabird]]s.  A high abundance and diversity of [[sea cucumber]]s, [[over-exploitation|over-exploited]] on other reefs in the region, is present, with 45 species recorded.&lt;ref name=ARL/&gt;

A memorandum of understanding between the Australian and Indonesian governments allows Indonesian fishermen access to their traditional fishing grounds within the region, subject to limits.

==Economy and migration==
There is no economic activity in the Territory. As Ashmore Reef is the closest point of Australian territory to Indonesia, it was a popular target for [[people smugglers]] transporting [[asylum seekers]] to Australia&lt;ref&gt;[http://insideindonesia.org/edit66/anita4.htm Inside Indonesia] Anita Roberts &quot;Don't let them drown&quot; ''Inside Indonesia'' Apr–Jun 2001, vol. 64&lt;/ref&gt; despite its only [[water well|well]]s being infected with [[cholera]] or contaminated and [[potable water|undrinkable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/news/NAVYNEWS/editions/1999/06_28_99/story03.htm Bizarre Happenings at Reef], [[Royal Australian Navy]] News, 28 June 1999, accessed 29 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Once they had landed on Ashmore, asylum seekers could claim to have entered Australian territory and request to be processed as refugees. The use of Ashmore for this purpose created great notoriety during late 2001, when refugee arrivals became a major political issue in Australia. As Australia was not the country of first asylum for these &quot;[[boat people]]&quot;, the Australian Government did not consider it had a responsibility to accept them.

A number of things were done to discourage the practice such as attempting to have the people smugglers arrested in Indonesia; the so-called [[Pacific Solution]] of processing them in third countries; the boarding and forced turnaround of the boats by Australian military forces, and finally excising Ashmore and many other small islands from the [[Australian migration zone]]. Two boatloads of asylum seekers were each detained for several days in the lagoon at Ashmore after failed attempts by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] to turn them back to Indonesia in October 2001.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Acoustic theory''' is the field relating to mathematical description of [[sound]] [[waves]]. It is derived from [[fluid dynamics]]. See [[acoustics]] for the [[engineering]] approach.

The propagation of sound waves in a fluid (such as air) can be modeled by an equation of motion (conservation of [[momentum]]) and an equation of continuity (conservation of [[mass]]).  With some simplifications, in particular constant density, they can be given as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
     \rho_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \nabla p &amp; = 0  \qquad \text{(Momentum balance)} \\
     \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \kappa~\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} &amp; = 0  \qquad \text{(Mass balance)}
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p(\mathbf{x}, t)&lt;/math&gt; is the acoustic pressure and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}, t)&lt;/math&gt; is the acoustic fluid velocity vector, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of spatial coordinates &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time, &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; is the static mass density of the medium and &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[bulk modulus]] of the medium.  The bulk modulus can be expressed in terms of the density and the speed of sound in the medium (&lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt;) as
: &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \rho_0 c_0^2 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[acoustic wave equation]] is a combination of these two sets of balance equations and can be expressed as &lt;ref&gt;Douglas D. Reynolds. (1981). ''Engineering Principles in Acoustics'', Allyn and Bacon Inc., Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial^2 \mathbf{v}}{\partial t^2} - c_0^2~\nabla^2\mathbf{v} = 0
   \qquad \text{or} \qquad
   \cfrac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} - c_0^2~\nabla^2 p = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
The [[acoustic wave equation]] (and the mass and momentum balance equations) are often expressed in terms of a [[scalar potential]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \nabla\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.  In that case the [[acoustic wave equation]] is written as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial t^2} - c_0^2~\nabla^2 \varphi = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the momentum balance and mass balance are expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   p + \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~
   \rho + \cfrac{\rho_0}{c_0^2}~\cfrac{\partial\varphi}{\partial t} = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation of the governing equations==
The derivations of the above equations for waves in an acoustic medium are given below.

===Conservation of momentum===
The equations for the [[Derivation_of_the_Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations#General_form_of_the_Navier.E2.80.93Stokes_equations|conservation of linear momentum]] for a fluid medium are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot\boldsymbol{s} + \rho\mathbf{b}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; is the body force per unit mass, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure, and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the deviatoric stress.  If &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the  Cauchy stress, then
:&lt;math&gt;
   p := -\tfrac{1}{3}~\text{tr}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) ~;~~
   \boldsymbol{s} := \boldsymbol{\sigma} + p~\boldsymbol{\mathit{1}}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\mathit{1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the rank-2 identity tensor.

We make several assumptions to derive the momentum balance equation for an acoustic medium.  These assumptions and the resulting forms of the momentum equations are outlined below.

====Assumption 1: Newtonian fluid====
In acoustics, the fluid medium is assumed to be [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]].  For a Newtonian fluid, the deviatoric stress tensor is related to the velocity by
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s} = \mu~\left[\nabla\mathbf{v} + (\nabla\mathbf{v})^T\right] +
       \lambda~(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v})~\boldsymbol{\mathit{1}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the shear [[viscosity]] and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[bulk viscosity]].

Therefore, the divergence of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{s}&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{s} \equiv \cfrac{\partial s_{ij}}{\partial x_i} &amp; = 
     \mu \left[\cfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j}+\cfrac{\partial v_j}{\partial x_i}\right)\right] + \lambda~\left[\cfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_k}{\partial x_k}\right)\right]\delta_{ij} \\
    &amp; = \mu~\cfrac{\partial^2 v_i}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} + \mu~\cfrac{\partial^2 v_j}{\partial x_i\partial x_i} + \lambda~\cfrac{\partial^2 v_k}{\partial x_k\partial x_j} \\
    &amp; = (\mu + \lambda)~\cfrac{\partial^2 v_i}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} + \mu~\cfrac{\partial^2 v_j}{\partial x_i^2} \\
    &amp; \equiv (\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}) + \mu~\nabla^2\mathbf{v} ~.
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Using the identity &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\mathbf{v} = \nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}) - \nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{s} = (2\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}) -
      \mu~\nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{v}~.
  &lt;/math&gt;
The equations for the conservation of momentum may then be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + (2\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}) -
      \mu~\nabla\times\nabla\times\mathbf{v} + \rho\mathbf{b}
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 2: Irrotational flow====
For most acoustics problems we assume that the flow is irrotational, that is, the [[vorticity]] is zero.  In that case
:&lt;math&gt;
   \nabla\times\mathbf{v} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the momentum equation reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;
   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + (2\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}) + \rho\mathbf{b}
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 3: No body forces====
Another frequently made assumption is that effect of body forces on the fluid medium is negligible.  The momentum equation then further simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt;
   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p + (2\mu + \lambda)~\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v})
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 4: No viscous forces====
Additionally, if we assume that there are no viscous forces in the medium (the bulk and shear viscosities are zero), the momentum equation takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\right) = -\nabla p
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 5: Small disturbances====
An important simplifying assumption for acoustic waves is that the amplitude of the disturbance of the field quantities is small.  This assumption leads to the linear or small signal acoustic wave equation.  Then we can express the variables as the sum of the (time averaged) mean field (&lt;math&gt;\langle\cdot\rangle&lt;/math&gt;) that varies in space and a small fluctuating field (&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\cdot}&lt;/math&gt;) that varies in space and time.  That is
:&lt;math&gt;
   p = \langle p\rangle + \tilde{p} ~;~~
   \rho = \langle\rho\rangle + \tilde{\rho} ~;~~
   \mathbf{v} = \langle\mathbf{v}\rangle + \tilde{\mathbf{v}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial\langle p \rangle}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~ \cfrac{\partial\langle \rho \rangle}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~
   \cfrac{\partial\langle \mathbf{v} \rangle}{\partial t} = \mathbf{0} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Then the momentum equation can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right] \left[\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{v}}}{\partial t}  + \left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\right] \cdot \nabla \left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\right]\right] = -\nabla \left[\langle p\rangle+\tilde{p}\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
Since the fluctuations are assumed to be small, products of the fluctuation terms can be neglected (to first order) and we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   \langle\rho\rangle~\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{v}}}{\partial t} &amp; +
   \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\cdot\nabla \langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\right]+
   \langle\rho\rangle\left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\cdot\nabla\tilde{\mathbf{v}} +
     \tilde{\mathbf{v}}\cdot\nabla\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\right] \\
   &amp; = -\nabla \left[\langle p\rangle+\tilde{p}\right]
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 6: Homogeneous medium====
Next we assume that the medium is homogeneous; in the sense that the time averaged variables
&lt;math&gt;\langle p \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle \rho \rangle&lt;/math&gt; have zero gradients, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla\langle p \rangle =  0 ~;~~ \nabla\langle \rho \rangle = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The momentum equation then becomes
:&lt;math&gt;
   \langle\rho\rangle~\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{v}}}{\partial t} +
   \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\cdot\nabla \langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\right]+
   \langle\rho\rangle\left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\cdot\nabla\tilde{\mathbf{v}} +
     \tilde{\mathbf{v}}\cdot\nabla\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle\right]
   = -\nabla\tilde{p}
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 7: Medium at rest====
At this stage we assume that the medium is at rest which implies that the mean velocity is zero, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.  Then the balance of momentum reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;
    \langle\rho\rangle~\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{v}}}{\partial t} = -\nabla\tilde{p}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Dropping the tildes and using &lt;math&gt;\rho_0 := \langle\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, we get the commonly used form of the acoustic momentum equation
:&lt;math&gt;
    \rho_0~\frac{\partial\mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \nabla p = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Conservation of mass===
The equation for the [[Derivation_of_the_Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations#Conservation_of_mass|conservation of mass]] in a fluid volume (without any mass sources or sinks) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density of the fluid and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid velocity.

The equation for the conservation of mass for an acoustic medium can also be derived in a manner similar to that used for the conservation of momentum.

====Assumption 1: Small disturbances====
From the assumption of small disturbances we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   p = \langle p\rangle + \tilde{p} ~;~~
   \rho = \langle\rho\rangle + \tilde{\rho} ~;~~
   \mathbf{v} = \langle\mathbf{v}\rangle + \tilde{\mathbf{v}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial\langle p \rangle}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~ \cfrac{\partial\langle \rho \rangle}{\partial t} = 0 ~;~~
   \cfrac{\partial\langle \mathbf{v} \rangle}{\partial t} = \mathbf{0} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Then the mass balance equation can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +
    \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\nabla \cdot\left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\right] +
   \nabla\left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\cdot \left[\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\right]= 0
  &lt;/math&gt;
If we neglect higher than first order terms in the fluctuations, the mass balance equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +
    \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\nabla \cdot\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+
    \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{v}} +
    \nabla\left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\cdot\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+
    \nabla\langle\rho\rangle\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{v}}= 0
  &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 2: Homogeneous medium====
Next we assume that the medium is homogeneous, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \nabla\langle \rho \rangle = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Then the mass balance equation takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +
    \left[\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}\right]\nabla \cdot\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle+
    \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{v}} +
    \nabla\tilde{\rho}\cdot\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle
    = 0
  &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 3: Medium at rest====
At this stage we assume that the medium is at rest, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{v}\rangle = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.  Then the mass balance equation can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} +
    \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{v}} = 0
  &lt;/math&gt;

====Assumption 4: Ideal gas, adiabatic, reversible====
In order to close the system of equations we need an [[equation of state]] for the pressure.  To do that we assume that the medium is an [[ideal gas]] and all acoustic waves compress the medium in an [[adiabatic]] and [[reversible]] manner.  The equation of state can then be expressed in the form of the differential equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
    \cfrac{dp}{d\rho} = \cfrac{\gamma~p}{\rho} ~;~~ \gamma := \cfrac{c_p}{c_v} ~;~~ c^2 = \cfrac{\gamma~p}{\rho} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat]] at constant pressure, &lt;math&gt;c_v&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat]] at constant volume, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the wave speed.  The value of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is 1.4 if the acoustic medium is air.

For small disturbances
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{dp}{d\rho} \approx \cfrac{\tilde{p}}{\tilde{\rho}}  ~;~~
   \cfrac{p}{\rho} \approx \cfrac{\langle p \rangle}{\langle \rho \rangle} ~;~~
   c^2 \approx c_0^2 = \cfrac{\gamma~\langle p\rangle}{\langle \rho \rangle} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of sound]] in the medium.

Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\tilde{p}}{\tilde{\rho}} = \gamma~\cfrac{\langle p \rangle}{\langle \rho \rangle}
     = c_0^2 \qquad \implies \qquad
   \cfrac{\partial\tilde{p}}{\partial t} = c_0^2 \cfrac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The balance of mass can then be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{1}{c_0^2}\frac{\partial\tilde{p}}{\partial t} +
    \langle\rho\rangle\nabla\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{v}} = 0
  &lt;/math&gt;
Dropping the tildes and defining &lt;math&gt;\rho_0 :=  \langle\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; gives us the commonly used expression for the balance of mass in an acoustic medium:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \rho_0~c_0^2~\nabla\cdot\mathbf{v} = 0 ~.
  &lt;/math&gt;

==Governing equations in cylindrical coordinates==
If we use a [[cylindrical coordinate system]] &lt;math&gt;(r,\theta,z)&lt;/math&gt; with [[basis vectors]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_r, \mathbf{e}_\theta, \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;, then the [[gradient]] of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and the [[divergence]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; are given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     \nabla p &amp; = \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z \\
     \nabla\cdot\mathbf{v} &amp; = \cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial r} + \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta} + v_r\right) + \cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial z}
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the [[velocity]] has been expressed as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = v_r~\mathbf{e}_r+v_\theta~\mathbf{e}_\theta+v_z~\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;.

The equations for the [[conservation of momentum]] may then be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \rho_0~\left[\cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial t}~\mathbf{e}_r+\cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial t}~\mathbf{e}_\theta+\cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial t}~\mathbf{e}_z\right] +
\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial r}~\mathbf{e}_r + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}~\mathbf{e}_\theta + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}~\mathbf{e}_z = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
In terms of components, these three equations for the [[conservation of momentum]] in [[cylindrical coordinates]] are
:&lt;math&gt;
    \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial t} + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial r}  = 0 ~;~~
    \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial t} + \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}  = 0 ~;~~
    \rho_0~\cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial t} + \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}  = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

The equation for the [[conservation of mass]] can similarly be written in [[cylindrical coordinates]] as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \kappa\left[\cfrac{\partial v_r}{\partial r} + \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta} + v_r\right) + \cfrac{\partial v_z}{\partial z}\right] = 0 ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Time harmonic acoustic equations in cylindrical coordinates===
The acoustic equations for the [[conservation of momentum]] and the [[conservation of mass]] are often expressed in time [[harmonic]] form (at fixed [[frequency]]).  In that case, the pressures and the velocity are assumed to be time harmonic functions of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   p(\mathbf{x}, t) = \hat{p}(\mathbf{x})~e^{-i\omega t} ~;~~
   \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}, t) = \hat{\mathbf{v}}(\mathbf{x})~e^{-i\omega t} ~;~~ i := \sqrt{-1}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency.  Substitution of these expressions into the governing equations in [[cylindrical coordinates]] gives us the fixed frequency form of the [[conservation of momentum]]
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{\partial\hat{p}}{\partial r} = i\omega~\rho_0~\hat{v}_r ~;~~
   \cfrac{1}{r}~\cfrac{\partial\hat{p}}{\partial \theta} = i\omega~\rho_0~\hat{v}_\theta ~;~~
    \cfrac{\partial\hat{p}}{\partial z} = i\omega~\rho_0~\hat{v}_z
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the fixed frequency form of the [[conservation of mass]]
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{i\omega \hat{p}}{\kappa} = \cfrac{\partial \hat{v}_r}{\partial r} + \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial \hat{v}_\theta}{\partial \theta} + \hat{v}_r\right) + \cfrac{\partial \hat{v}_z}{\partial z} ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Special case: No z-dependence====
In the special case where the field quantities are independent of the z-coordinate we can eliminate &lt;math&gt;v_r, v_\theta&lt;/math&gt; to get
:&lt;math&gt;
   \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} +
     \frac{1}{r^2}~\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial\theta^2} + \frac{\omega^2\rho_0}{\kappa}~p = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
Assuming that the solution of this equation can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
    p(r,\theta) = R(r)~Q(\theta)
 &lt;/math&gt;
we can write the partial differential equation as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \cfrac{r^2}{R}~\cfrac{d^2R}{dr^2} + \cfrac{r}{R}~\cfrac{dR}{dr} + \cfrac{r^2\omega^2\rho_0}{\kappa} = -\cfrac{1}{Q}~\cfrac{d^2Q}{d\theta^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The left hand side is not a function of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; while the right hand side is not a function of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;
   r^2~\cfrac{d^2R}{dr^2} + r~\cfrac{dR}{dr} + \cfrac{r^2\omega^2\rho_0}{\kappa}~R = \alpha^2~R ~;~~ \cfrac{d^2Q}{d\theta^2} = -\alpha^2~Q
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.  Using the substitution
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tilde{r} \leftarrow \left(\omega\sqrt{\cfrac{\rho_0}{\kappa}}\right) r = k~r
 &lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tilde{r}^2~\cfrac{d^2R}{d\tilde{r}^2} + \tilde{r}~\cfrac{dR}{d\tilde{r}} + (\tilde{r}^2-\alpha^2)~R = 0 ~;~~ \cfrac{d^2Q}{d\theta^2} = -\alpha^2~Q
 &lt;/math&gt;
The equation on the left is the [[Bessel equation]] which has the general solution
:&lt;math&gt;
   R(r) =  A_\alpha~J_\alpha(k~r) + B_\alpha~J_{-\alpha}(k~r)
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;J_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the cylindrical [[Bessel function]] of the first kind and &lt;math&gt;A_\alpha, B_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are undetermined constants.  The equation on the right has the general solution
:&lt;math&gt;
   Q(\theta) = C_\alpha~e^{i\alpha\theta} + D_\alpha~e^{-i\alpha\theta}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C_\alpha,D_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are undetermined constants.  Then the solution of the acoustic wave equation is
:&lt;math&gt;
   p(r,\theta) = \left[A_\alpha~J_\alpha(k~r) + B_\alpha~J_{-\alpha}(k~r)\right]\left(C_\alpha~e^{i\alpha\theta} + D_\alpha~e^{-i\alpha\theta}\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;
Boundary conditions are needed at this stage to determine &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and the other undetermined constants.

'''Alexander Mackenzie''', [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC]] (January 28, 1822 – April 17, 1892), a building contractor and newspaper editor, was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|second]] [[Prime Minister of Canada]] from November 7, 1873 to October 8, 1878.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Logierait]], [[Perthshire]], [[Scotland]] to Alexander Mackenzie  Sr. and Mary Stewart Fleming. He was the third of ten children. At the age of 13, Mackenzie's father died, and he was forced to end his formal education in order to help support his family. At the age of 16 he apprenticed as a stone mason and by the age of 20 he had reached journeyman status in this field. Mackenzie [[immigrate]]d to [[Canada]] in 1842 to seek a better life as well as to follow his sweetheart, Helen Neil. Shortly thereafter, he converted from [[Presbyterianism]] to [[Baptist]] beliefs. Mackenzie's faith was to link him to the increasingly influential [[Temperance movement|temperance]] cause, particularly strong in [[Ontario]] where he lived, a constituency of which he was to represent in the [[Parliament of Canada]].

Mackenzie married Helen Neil (1826–1852) in 1845 and with her had three children, with only one girl surviving infancy. In 1853, he married [[Jane Sym]] (1825–1893).

[[Image:Mason overseer.jpg|thumb|left|250px|1875 [[Canadian Illustrated News]] cartoon shows Mackenzie the Mason and Governor General [[Lord Dufferin]] the Overseer ]]In Canada, Mackenzie continued his career as a stone mason, building many structures that still stand today. He began working as a general contractor, earning a reputation for being a hard working, honest man as well as having a working man's view on fiscal policy.

Mackenzie involved himself in politics almost from the moment he arrived in Canada. He campaigned relentlessly for George Brown, owner of the Reformist paper The Globe in the 1851 election, helping him to win a seat in the assembly. In 1852 Mackenzie became editor of another reformist paper, the Lambton Shield (now the Sarnia Observer). As editor, Mackenzie was perhaps a little too vocal, leading the paper to a suit of law for libel against the local conservative candidate. The paper lost the suit and was forced to fold due to financial hardship. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly as a supporter of George Brown in 1861.

===Prime Minister===
When the [[John A. Macdonald|Macdonald]] government fell due to the [[Pacific scandal]] in 1873, the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], called upon Mackenzie, who had been chosen as the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] a few months earlier, to form a new government.  Mackenzie formed a government and asked the Governor General to call an [[Canadian federal election, 1874|election for January 1874]]. The Liberals won, and Mackenzie remained prime minister until the [[Canadian federal election, 1878|1878 election]] when Macdonald's [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]] returned to power with a [[majority government]].

It was unusual for a man of Mackenzie's humble origins to attain such a position in an age which generally offered such opportunity only to the privileged. Lord Dufferin, the current Governor General, expressed early misgivings about a stonemason taking over government. But on meeting Mackenzie, Dufferin revised his opinions: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;However narrow and inexperienced Mackenzie may be, I imagine he is a thoroughly upright, well-principled, and well-meaning man.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mackenzie also served as Minister of Public Works and oversaw the completion of the Parliament Buildings. While drawing up the plans, he included a circular staircase leading directly from his office to the outside of the building which allowed him to escape the patronage-seekers waiting for him in his ante-chamber. Proving Dufferin's reflections on his character to be true, Mackenzie disliked intensely the patronage inherent in politics. Nevertheless, he found it a necessary evil in order to maintain party unity and ensure the loyalty of his fellow Liberals.

[[Image:Alexander Mackenzie Statue.jpg|Statue of Alexander Mackenzie on Parliament Hill, Canada.|thumb|left]] In keeping with his democratic ideals, Mackenzie refused the offer of a knighthood three times, and was thus the only one of Canada's first eight Prime Ministers not to be knighted. His pride in his working class origins never left him. Once, while touring [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] as prime minister, he asked the soldier accompanying him if he knew the thickness of the wall beside them. The embarrassed escort confessed that he didn't and Mackenzie replied, &quot;I do. It is five feet, ten inches. I know, because I built it myself!&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Canada's Prime Ministers, 1867 - 1994: Biographies and Anecdotes. [Ottawa]: National Archives of Canada, [1994]. 40 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Prime Minister, Alexander Mackenzie strove to reform and simplify the machinery of government. He introduced the [[secret ballot]]; advised the creation of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]; the establishment of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] in 1874; the creation of the Office of the [[Auditor General of Canada|Auditor General]] in 1878; and struggled to continue progress on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|national railway]]. 

However, his term was marked by [[economic depression]] that had grown out of the [[Panic of 1873]], which Mackenzie's government was unable to alleviate. In 1874, Mackenzie negotiated a new [[free trade]] agreement with the United States, eliminating the high protective tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets. However, this action did not bolster the economy, and construction of the CPR slowed drastically due to lack of funding. In 1876 the Conservative opposition announced a [[National Policy]] of protective tariffs, which resonated with voters. When an [[Canadian federal election, 1878|election]] was held at the conclusion of Mackenzie's five-year term, the Conservatives were swept back into office in a landslide victory.

After his government's defeat, Mackenzie remained [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] for another two years, until 1880. He remained an MP until his death in 1892 from a stroke that resulted from hitting his head during a fall. He died in [[Toronto]] and was buried in Lakeview Cemetery in [[Sarnia, Ontario]].

In their 1999 study of the Prime Ministers of Canada, which included the results of a survey of Canadian historians, [[J.L. Granatstein]] and [[Norman Hillmer]] found that Mackenzie was in the #11 place just after [[John Sparrow David Thompson]].

'''Ashoka''' ([[Devanāgarī]]: अशोक, [[Bangla]]: অশোক, [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Aśoka}}'', {{IPA-sa|aˈɕoːkə|IPA}}, ca. 304&amp;ndash;232 BC), popularly known as '''Ashoka the Great''', was an [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] [[emperor]] of the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya Dynasty]] who ruled almost all of the [[Indian subcontinent]] from ca. 269 BC to 232 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Thapur (1973), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; One of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka reigned over most of present-day India after a number of military conquests. His empire stretched from present-day [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]] and eastern parts of [[Iran]] in the west, to the present-day [[Bangladesh]] and the Indian state of [[Assam]] in the east, and as far south as northern [[Kerala]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]]. He conquered the kingdom named [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]], which no one in his dynasty had conquered starting from [[Chandragupta Maurya]]. His reign was headquartered in [[Magadha]] (present-day [[Bihar]], India). He embraced [[Buddhism]] from the prevalent [[Brahminism]] tradition after witnessing the mass deaths of the [[Kalinga War|war of Kalinga]], which he himself had waged out of a desire for conquest. He was later dedicated to the propagation of Buddhism across [[Asia]] and established monuments marking several significant sites in the life of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Ashoka was a devotee of [[ahimsa]] ([[nonviolence]]), [[love]], [[truth]], [[tolerance]] and [[vegetarianism]]. Ashoka is remembered in history as a [[philanthropic]] administrator.
In the [[history of India]], Ashoka is referred to as ''[[Samraat]] [[Chakravartin]] Ashoka'' - the Emperor of Emperors ''Ashoka''.

His name &quot;{{IAST|aśoka}}&quot; means &quot;painless, without sorrow&quot; in [[Sanskrit]] (the [[a privativum|''a'' privativum]] and ''śoka'' &quot;pain, distress&quot;). In his [[Edicts of Asoka|edicts]], he is referred to as ''{{IAST|Devānāmpriya}}'' (Pali ''{{IAST|Devānaṃpiya}}'' or &quot;The Beloved Of The Gods&quot;), and ''{{IAST|Priyadarśin}}'' (Pali ''{{IAST|Piyadasī}}'' or &quot;He who regards everyone with affection&quot;).

Along with the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], his legend is related in the later 2nd century ''[[Ashokavadana|{{IAST|Aśokāvadāna}}]]'' (&quot;''Narrative of Asoka''&quot;) and ''[[Divyavadana|{{IAST|Divyāvadāna}}]]'' (&quot;''Divine narrative''&quot;), and in the [[Sri Lanka]]n text ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' (&quot;''Great Chronicle''&quot;).

Ashoka played a critical role in helping make Buddhism a world religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Rich. [http://www.tibethouse.us/programs/view/102312/4 To Uphold The World Author Discussion]&lt;/ref&gt; As the peace-loving ruler of one of the world's largest, richest and most powerful multi-ethnic states, he is considered an exemplary ruler, who tried to put into practice a secular state ethic of non-violence. The emblem of the modern [[Republic of India]] is an adaptation of the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]].

==Biography==
{{Story|date=April 2011}}

===Early life===
Ashoka was born to the [[Mauryan]] emperor [[Bindusara]] and his queen, Dharma (or Dhamma).  Ashokavandana states that his mother was a queen named Subhadrangi, the daughter of Champa. A palace intrigue kept her away from the king. This eventually ended, and she bore a son. It is from her exclamation &quot;I am now without sorrow&quot;, that Ashoka got his name. The Divyavandana tells a similar story, but gives the name of the queen as Janapadakalyani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Ashoka had several elder siblings, all of whom were his half-brothers from other wives of Bindusara.

He had been given the royal military training knowledge. He was a fearsome hunter, and according to a legend, he killed a lion with just a wooden rod. He was very adventurous and a trained fighter, who was known for his skills with the sword. Because of his reputation as a frightening warrior and a heartless general, he was sent to curb the riots in the [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]] province of the Mauryan empire.

===Rise to power===
[[File:Maurya Dynasty in 265 BCE.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Maurya Empire]] at the age of  Ashoka. The empire stretched from [[Iran]] to [[Bangladesh]]/[[Assam]] and from [[Central Asia]] ([[Afghanistan]]) to [[Tamil Nadu]]/[[South India]].]]
The Divyavandana refers to Ashoka putting down a revolt due to activities of wicked ministers. This may have been an incident in [[Bindusara]]'s times. [[Taranatha]]'s account states that [[Chanakya]], one of Bindusara's great lords, destroyed the nobles and kings of 16 towns and made himself the master of all territory between the eastern and the western seas. Some historians consider this as an indication of Bindusara's conquest of the Deccan while others consider it as suppression of a revolt. Following this Ashoka was stationed at Ujjayini as governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;/&gt;

Bindusara's death in 273 BC led to a four war over succession. According to Divyavandana, Bindusara wanted his son Sushim to succeed him but Ashoka was supported by his father's ministers. A minister named Radhagupta seems to have played an important role. One of the Ashokavandana states that Ashoka managed to become the king by getting rid of the legitimate heir to the throne, by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals. The [[Dipavamsa]] and [[Mahavamsa]] refer to Ashoka killing 99 of his brothers, sparing only one, named Tissa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;/&gt;

===Early life as Emperor===
Ashoka is said to have been of a wicked nature and bad temper. He submitted his ministers to a test of loyalty and had 500 of them killed. He also kept a harem of around 500 women. Once when certain lot of these women insulted him, he had the whole lot of them burnt to death. He also built hell on earth, an elaborate and horrific torture chamber. This torture Chamber earned him the name of Chand Ashoka (Sanskrit), meaning Ashoka the Fierce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;/&gt;

Ascending the throne, Ashoka expanded his empire over the next eight years, from the present-day boundaries and regions of [[Burma]]–[[Bangladesh]] and the state of [[Assam]] in India in the east to the territory of present-day [[Iran]] / [[Persia]] and [[Afghanistan]] in the west; from the [[Pamir]] Knots in the north almost to the peninsular of [[southern India]] (i.e. [[Tamil Nadu]] / [[Andhra Pradesh]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;/&gt;

===Conquest of Kalinga===
{{Main|Kalinga War}}
While the early part of Ashoka's reign was apparently quite bloodthirsty, he became a follower of the [[Buddha]]'s teaching after his conquest of Kalinga on the east coast of India in the present-day states of southern [[Orissa]] and north coastal [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Kalinga was a state that prided itself on its sovereignty and democracy. With its monarchical parliamentary democracy it was quite an exception in ancient Bharata where there existed the concept of [[Rajdharma]]. Rajdharma means the duty of the rulers, which was intrinsically entwined with the concept of bravery and [[Kshatriya]] dharma.

The pretext for the start of the [[Kalinga War]] (265 BC or 263 BC) is uncertain. One of Susima's brothers might have fled to Kalinga and found official refuge there. Kalinga put up a stiff resistance, but they were no match for Ashoka's brutal strength. The whole of Kalinga was plundered and destroyed. Ashoka's later edicts state that about 100,000 people were killed on the Kalinga side and 10,000 from Ashoka's army. Thousands of men and women were deported.

===Buddhist conversion===

As the legend goes, one day after the war was over, Ashoka ventured out to roam the city and all he could see were burnt houses and scattered corpses. This sight made him sick and he cried the famous monologue:  &lt;blockquote&gt;
''What have I done? If this is a victory, what's a defeat then? Is this a victory or a defeat?  Is this justice or injustice? Is it gallantry or a rout? Is it valor to kill innocent children and women? Do I do it to widen the empire and for prosperity or to destroy the other's kingdom and splendor?  One has lost her husband, someone else a father, someone a child, someone an unborn infant.... What's this debris of the corpses? Are these marks of victory or defeat? Are these vultures, crows, eagles the messengers of death or evil? ''&lt;/blockquote&gt;  The brutality of the conquest led him to adopt Buddhism, and he used his position to propagate the relatively new religion to new heights, as far as ancient Rome and Egypt. He made Buddhism his state religion around 260 BC, and propagated it and preached it within his domain and worldwide from about 250 BC. Emperor Ashoka undoubtedly has to be credited with the first serious attempt to develop a Buddhist policy.
[[File:Asokanpillar1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ashokan Pillar at [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]]]]

Prominent in this cause were his son Venerable [[Rahul]] and daughter [[Sanghamitra]] (whose name means &quot;friend of the Sangha&quot;), who established Buddhism in Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]). He built thousands of Stupas and Viharas for Buddhist followers. The Stupas of Sanchi are world famous and the stupa named [[Sanchi Stupa]]  was built by Emperor Ashoka. During the remaining portion of Ashoka's reign, he pursued an official policy of [[nonviolence]] ([[ahimsa]]). Even the unnecessary slaughter or mutilation of animals was immediately abolished. Everyone became protected by the king's [[law]] against sport hunting and branding. Limited hunting was permitted for consumption reasons but Ashoka also promoted the concept of vegetarianism. Ashoka also showed mercy to those imprisoned, allowing them leave for the outside a day of the year. He attempted to raise the professional ambition of the common man by building universities for study, and water transit and irrigation systems for trade and agriculture. He treated his subjects as equals regardless of their religion, politics and caste. The kingdoms surrounding his, so easily overthrown, were instead made to be well-respected allies.

He is acclaimed for constructing hospitals for animals and renovating major roads throughout India. After this transformation, Ashoka came to be known as Dhammashoka (Sanskrit), meaning Ashoka, the follower of Dharma. Ashoka defined the main principles of dharma (dhamma) as nonviolence, tolerance of all sects and opinions, obedience to parents, respect for the Brahmans and other religious teachers and priests, liberality towards friends, humane treatment of servants, and generosity towards all. These principles suggest a general ethic of behaviour to which no religious or social group could object.

Some critics say that Ashoka was afraid of more wars, but among his neighbors, including the [[Seleucid Empire]] and the Greco-Bactrian kingdom established by [[Diodotus I]], none could match his strength. He was a contemporary of both [[Antiochus I Soter]] and his successor [[Antiochus II Theos]] of the Seleucid dynasty as well as [[Diodotus I]] and his son [[Diodotus II]] of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. If his inscriptions and edicts are well studied one finds that he was familiar with the Hellenic world but never in awe of it. His edicts, which talk of friendly relations, give the names of both Antiochus of the Seleucid empire and [[Ptolemy III]] of [[Egypt]]. The fame of the [[Mauryan]] empire was widespread from the time that Ashoka's grandfather [[Chandragupta Maurya]] defeated [[Seleucus Nicator]], the founder of the Seleucid Dynasty.
[[File:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Stupa of [[Sanchi]].]]

The source of much of our knowledge of Ashoka is the many inscriptions he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire.  All his inscriptions have the imperial touch and show compassionate loving. He addressed his people as his &quot;children&quot;. These inscriptions promoted Buddhist morality and encouraged nonviolence and adherence to Dharma (duty or proper behavior), and they talk of his fame and conquered lands as well as the neighboring kingdoms holding up his might. One also gets some primary information about the Kalinga War and Ashoka's allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration. The Ashoka Pillar at [[Sarnath]] is the most popular of the relics left by Ashoka. Made of sandstone, this pillar records the visit of the emperor to Sarnath, in the 3rd century BC. It has a four-lion capital (four lions standing back to back) which was adopted as the emblem of the modern Indian republic. The lion symbolizes both Ashoka's imperial rule and the kingship of the [[Buddha]]. In translating these monuments, historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the Mauryan Empire. It is difficult to determine whether or not some actual events ever happened, but the stone etchings clearly depict how Ashoka wanted to be thought of and remembered.

Ashoka's own words as known from his [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts]] are: &quot;All men are my children. I am like a father to them. As every father desires the good and the happiness of his children, I wish that all men should be happy always.&quot; Edward D'Cruz interprets the Ashokan dharma as a &quot;religion to be used as a symbol of a new imperial unity and a cementing force to weld the diverse and heterogeneous elements of the empire&quot;.

Also, in the Edicts, Ashoka mentions Hellenistic kings of the period as converts to Buddhism, although no Hellenic historical record of this event remain:

{{quote|The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred [[yojana]]s (5,400–9,600 km) away, where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] rules, beyond there where the four kings named [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]], [[Antigonus Gonatas|Antigonos]], [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]] rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], the [[Pandya]]s, and as far as [[Tambaparni]] ([[Sri Lanka]]).|[[Edicts of Ashoka]], [[Ashoka's Major Rock Edict|Rock Edict]] 13 (S. Dhammika)}}

Ashoka also claims that he encouraged the development of [[herbal medicine]], for human and nonhuman animals, in their territories:

{{quote|Everywhere within Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi's [Ashoka's] domain, and among the people beyond the borders, the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], the [[Pandya]]s, the Satiyaputras, the Keralaputras, as far as [[Tamraparni]] and where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] rules, and among the kings who are neighbors of Antiochos, everywhere has Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, made provision for two types of medical treatment: medical treatment for humans and medical treatment for animals. Wherever medical herbs suitable for humans or animals are not available, I have had them imported and grown. Wherever medical roots or fruits are not available I have had them imported and grown. Along roads I have had wells dug and trees planted for the benefit of humans and animals.|[[Edicts of Ashoka]], [[Ashoka's Major Rock Edict|Rock Edict]] 2}}

The Greeks in India even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as [[Dharmaraksita]], are described in [[Pāli|Pali]] sources as leading Greek ([[Yona]]) Buddhist monks, active in spreading Buddhism (the [[Mahavamsa]], XII&lt;ref name = &quot;plgotw&quot;&gt;Full text of the Mahavamsa [http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa/chapters.html Click chapter XII]&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Death and legacy===
[[Image:Ashoka Rock Edict at Junagadh.jpg|thumb|The [[Junagadh]] rock contains inscriptions by Ashoka (fourteen of the [[Edicts of Ashoka]]), [[Rudradaman I]] and [[Skandagupta]].]]
Ashoka ruled for an estimated forty years. After his death, the Mauryan dynasty lasted just fifty more years. Ashoka had many wives and children, but many of their names are lost to time. [[Mahinda|Mahindra]] and [[Sanghamitra]] were twins born by his 2nd wife, Devi, in the city of [[Ujjain]]. He had entrusted to them the job of making his state religion, Buddhism, more popular across the known and the unknown world. [[Mahinda|Mahindra]] and [[Sanghamitra]] went into [[Sri Lanka]] and converted the King, the Queen and their people to Buddhism. They were naturally not handling state affairs after him.

In his old age, he seems to have come under the spell of his youngest wife [[Tishyaraksha]]. It is said that she had got his son [[Kunala]], the regent in [[Taxila|Takshashila]], blinded by a wily [[wiktionary:stratagem|stratagem]]. The official executioners spared Kunala and he became a wandering singer accompanied by his favourite wife [[Kanchanmala]]. In [[Pataliputra]], Ashoka hears Kunala's song, and realizes that Kunala's misfortune may have been a punishment for some past sin of the emperor himself and condemns Tishyaraksha to death, restoring Kunala to the court. Kunala was succeeded by his son, [[Samprati]], but his rule did not last long after Ashoka's death.

The reign of Ashoka Maurya could easily have disappeared into history as the ages passed by, and would have had he not left behind a record of his trials. The testimony of this wise king was discovered in the form of magnificently sculpted pillars and boulders with a variety of actions and teachings he wished to be published etched into the stone. What Ashoka left behind was the first written language in India since the ancient city of [[Harappa]]. The language used for inscription was the then current spoken form called [[Prakrit]].

In the year 185 BC, about fifty years after Ashoka's death, the last Maurya ruler, [[Brhadrata]], was assassinated by the commander-in-chief of the Mauryan armed forces, [[Pusyamitra Sunga]], while he was taking the Guard of Honor of his forces. Pusyamitra Sunga founded the [[Sunga dynasty]] (185 BC-78 BC) and ruled just a fragmented part of the Mauryan Empire. Many of the northwestern territories of the Mauryan Empire (modern-day Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan) became the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]].

In 1992, Ashoka was ranked #53 on [[Michael H. Hart]]'s [[The 100|list of the most influential figures in history]]. In 2001, a semi-fictionalized portrayal of Ashoka's life was produced as a motion picture under the title ''[[Asoka (2001 film)|Asoka]]''.
King Ashoka, the third monarch of the Indian Mauryan dynasty, has come to be regarded as one of the most exemplary rulers in world history. The British historian H.G. Wells has written: &quot;Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Asoka shines, and shines, almost alone, a star.&quot;

====Buddhist Kingship====
{{Main|History of Buddhism|History of Buddhism in India}} {{See|Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Buddhism in Burma}}
One of the more enduring legacies of Ashoka Maurya was the model that he provided for the relationship between Buddhism and the state. Throughout Theravada Southeastern Asia, the model of ruler ship embodied by Ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated (in the [[Angkor]] kingdom, for instance). Under this model of 'Buddhist kingship', the king sought to legitimize his rule not through descent from a divine source, but by supporting and earning the approval of the Buddhist ''[[sangha]]''. Following Ashoka's example, kings established monasteries, funded the construction of stupas, and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom. Many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha, as Ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious issues during his reign. This development ultimately lead to a close association in many Southeast Asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy, an association that can still be seen today in the state-supported [[Buddhism in Thailand|Buddhism of Thailand]] and the traditional role of the Thai king as both a religious and secular leader. Ashoka also said that all his courtiers were true to their self and governed the people in a moral manner.

==Historical sources==
===Western sources===
Ashoka was almost forgotten by the historians of the early British India, but [[James Prinsep]] contributed in the revelation of historical sources. Another important historian was [[British people|British]] [[archaeologist]] [[John Hubert Marshall]] who was director-General of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]]. His main interests were [[Sanchi]] and [[Sarnath]] besides [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjodaro]]. Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]], a British archaeologist and army engineer and often known as the father of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], unveiled heritage sites like the [[Bharhut]] Stupa, Sarnath, Sanchi, and the Mahabodhi Temple; thus, his contribution is recognizable in realms of historical sources. [[Mortimer Wheeler], a [[British people|British]] archaeologist, also exposed Ashokan historical sources, especially the [[Taxila]].

===Eastern sources===
{{Main|Edicts of Ashoka|Ashokavadana|Mahavamsa|Dipavamsa}}
[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|Bilingual inscription in ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) by king Ashoka, from [[Kandahar]] (Shar-i-kuna). [[Kabul]] Museum.]]
Information about the life and reign of Ashoka primarily comes from a relatively small number of Buddhist sources. In particular, the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' ('Story of Ashoka'), written in the 2nd century, and the two [[Pāli]] chronicles of [[Sri Lanka]] (the [[Dipavamsa]] and [[Mahavamsa]]) provide most of the currently known information about Ashoka. Additional information is contributed by the [[Edicts of Asoka]], whose authorship was finally attributed to the Ashoka of Buddhist legend after the discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts (''Priyadarsi''&amp;nbsp;–  'favored by the Gods') as a title or additional name of Ashoka Mauriya. Architectural remains of his period have been found at [[Kumhrar]], [[Patna]], which include an 80-pillar [[hypostyle]] hall.

[[Edicts of Ashoka]] -The Edicts of Ashoka are a collection of 33 inscriptions on the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], as well as boulders and cave walls, made by the Emperor Ashoka of the Mauryan dynasty during his reign from 272 to 231 BC. These inscriptions are dispersed throughout the areas of modern-day Pakistan and India, and represent the first tangible evidence of Buddhism. The edicts describe in detail the first wide expansion of Buddhism through the sponsorship of one of the most powerful kings of Indian history.It give more information about  Ashoka's proselytism, Moral precepts, Religious precepts, Social and animal welfare .

[[Ashokavadana]] -
The Ashokavadana is a 2nd century CE text related to the legend of the Maurya Emperor Ashoka. The legend was translated into Chinese by [[Fa Hien]] in 300 CE.

[[Mahavamsa]] -The Mahavamsa (&quot;Great Chronicle&quot;) is a historical poem written in the [[Pali]] language, of the kings of [[Sri Lanka]]. It covers the period from the coming of King Vijaya of [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]] (ancient Orissa) in 543 BC to the reign of King Mahasena (334–361).As it often refers to the royal dynasties of India, the Mahavamsa is also valuable for historians who wish to date and relate contemporary royal dynasties in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is very important in dating the consecration of the Maurya emperor Ashoka.

[[Dipavamsa]] -The Dipavamsa, or &quot;Deepavamsa&quot;, (i.e., Chronicle of the Island, in Pali) is the oldest historical record of Sri Lanka. The chronicle is believe to be compiled from [[Atthakatha]] and other sources around the 3–4th century, King Dhatusena (4th century CE) had ordered that the Dipavamsa be recited at the [[Mahinda]] (son to Ashoka) festival held annually in Anuradhapura.

The use of Buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of Ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of Ashoka, as well as the interpretations of his edicts. Building on traditional accounts, early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution. Some scholars have tended to question this assessment. The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources are the Ashokan edicts, and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a Buddhist. In his edicts, Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time: [[Buddhism]], [[Brahmanism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Ajivika]]ism, and his edicts addressed to the population at large (there are some addressed specifically to Buddhists; this is not the case for the other religions) generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept.

However, there is strong evidence in the edicts alone that he was a Buddhist. In one edict he belittles rituals, and he banned Vedic animal sacrifices; these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the Vedic tradition for guidance. Furthermore, there are many edicts expressed to Buddhists alone; in one, Ashoka declares himself to be an &quot;[[upasaka]]&quot;, and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with Buddhist texts. He erected rock pillars at Buddhist holy sites, but did not do so for the sites of other religions. He also used the word [[Dharma (Buddhism)|&quot;dhamma&quot;]] to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action; this was an exclusively Buddhist use of the word. Finally, the ideals he promotes correspond to the first three steps of the Buddha's graduated discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Robinson, Willard Johnson, and Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Buddhist Religions'', fifth ed., Wadsworth 2005, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
===Global spread of Buddhism===
Ashoka, now a [[Buddhist]] emperor, believed that [[Buddhism]] is beneficial for all human beings as well as animals and plants, so he built 84,000 [[stupas]], [[Sangharama]], [[viharas]], [[Chaitya]], and residences for Buddhist monks all over [[South Asia]] and Central Asia. He gave donations to viharas and [[mathas]]. He sent his only daughter [[Sanghamitta]] and son [[Mahinda|Mahindra]] to spread Buddhism in [[Sri Lanka]] (ancient name Tamraparni). Ashoka also sent many prominent Buddhist monks (bhikshus) Sthaviras like Madhyamik Sthavira to modern [[Kashmir]] and [[Afghanistan]]; Maharaskshit Sthavira to [[Syria]], [[Persia]] / [[Iran]], [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]]; Massim Sthavira to [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]] and [[Mongolia]]; Sohn Uttar Sthavira to modern [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]] (old name Suvarnabhumi for Burma and Thailand), [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]]; Mahadhhamarakhhita stahvira to [[Maharashtra]] (old name Maharatthha); Maharakhhit Sthavira and Yavandhammarakhhita Sthavira to [[South India]].
Ashoka also invited Buddhists and non-Buddhists for religious conferences. Ashoka inspired the Buddhist monks to compose the  sacred religious texts, and also gave all types of help to that end. Ashoka also helped to develop viharas (intellectual hubs) such as [[Nalanda]] and [[Taxila]]. Ashoka helped to construct  [[Sanchi]] and [[Mahabodhi Temple]]. Ashoka never tried to harm or to destroy non-Buddhist religions, and indeed gave donations to non-Buddhists. As his reign continued his even-handedness was replaced with special inclination towards Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;N.V. Isaeva, ''Shankara and Indian philosophy''. SUNY Press, 1993, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka helped and respected both Sramans (Buddhists monks) and Brahmins (Vedic monks). Ashoka also helped to organize the [[Third Buddhist council]] (c. 250 BC) at Pataliputra (today's [[Patna]]). It was conducted by the monk [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] who was the spiritual teacher of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka.''

===As administrator===

Ashoka's military power was so strong that he was able to crush those empires that went to war against him. Still, he was on friendly terms with kingdoms in the South like [[Cholas]], [[Pandya]], Keralputra, the post Alexandrian empire, [[Tamraparni]], and [[Suvarnabhumi]] who were strong enough to remain outside his empire and continued to profess Hinduism. According to his edicts we know that he provided humanitarian help including [[physician|doctors]], [[hospitals]], [[inns]], [[Water well|wells]], medical herbs and [[engineers]] to his neighboring countries. In neighboring countries, Ashoka helped humans as well as animals. Ashoka also planted trees in his empire and his neighboring countries. Ashoka was perhaps the first emperor in human history to ban [[slavery]], [[hunting]], [[fishing]] and [[deforestation]]. Ashoka also banned the death sentence and asked the same for the neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;Available at: [http://www.thenagain.info/Classes/Sources/Asoka.html Asoka: Rock and Pillar Edicts]. Then Again: David Koeller. Retrieved on: 2009-02-21&lt;/ref&gt;
Ashoka commanded his people to serve the orders of their elders parents and religious monks ([[shramana]] and [[Brahmin]]). Ashoka also recommended his people study and respect all religions. According to Ashoka, to harm another's religion is a harm to one's own religion. Ashoka asserted his people to live with Dharmmacharana. Ashoka asked people to live with harmony, peace, love and tolerance. Ashoka called his people as his children, and they could call him when they need him. He also asked people to save money and not to spend for immoral causes. Ashoka also believed in dharmacharana (dhammacharana) and dharmavijaya (dhammavijaya). According to many European and Asian historians the age of Ashoka was the age of light and delightment. He was the first emperor in human history who has taught the lesson of unity, peace, equality and love. Ashoka's aim was not to expand the territories  but the welfare of all of his subjects (sarvajansukhay). In his vast empire there was no evidence of recognizable mutiny or civil war. Ashoka was the true devotee of nonviolence, peace and love. This made him different from other emperors. Ashoka also helped [[Buddhism]] as well as religions like [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Hellenic polytheism]] and [[Ajivikas]]. Ashoka was against any discrimination among humans. He helped students, the poor, orphans and the elderly with social, political and economic help. According to Ashoka, hatred gives birth to hatred and a feeling of love gives birth to love and mercy. According to him the happiness of people is the happiness of the ruler. His opinion was that the sword is not as powerful as love. Ashoka was also kind to prisoners, and respected animal life and tree life. Ashoka allowed females to be educated. He also permitted females to enter religious institutions. He allowed female Buddhist monastics such as [[Bhikkhuni]]. He combined in himself the complexity of a king and a simplicity of a buddhist monk.  Because of these reasons he is known as the emperor of all ages and thus became a milestone in the [[History of the world]].

===Ashoka Chakra===
{{main|Ashoka Chakra}}
[[File:Ashoka Chakra.svg|thumb|The [[Ashoka Chakra]], ''&quot;the wheel of Righteousness&quot; (Dharma in [[Sanskrit]] or Dhamma in [[Pali]])&quot;'']]

The [[Ashoka Chakra]] (the wheel of Ashoka) is a depiction of the Dharmachakra or Dhammachakka in [[Pali]], the Wheel of Dharma ([[Sanskrit]]: Chakra means wheel). The wheel has 24 spokes. The Ashoka Chakra has been widely inscribed on many relics of the [[Mauryan]] Emperor, most prominent among which is the Lion Capital of [[Sarnath]] and The [[Ashoka Pillar]]. The most visible use of the Ashoka Chakra today is at the centre of the National flag of the Republic of India (adopted on 22 July 1947), where it is rendered in a Navy-blue color on a White background, by replacing the symbol of Charkha (Spinning wheel) of the pre-independence versions of the flag. Ashoka Chakra can also been seen on the base of Lion Capital of Ashoka which has been adopted as the National Emblem of India.

The Ashoka chakra was built by Ashoka during his reign. [[Chakra]] is a [[Sanskrit]] word which also means cycle or self repeating process.  The process it signifies is the cycle of time as how the world changes with time.

A few days before India became independent on August 1947, the specially constituted [[Constituent Assembly]] decided that the [[flag of India]] must be acceptable to all parties and communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOTW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/in.html|title=India|accessdate= 2006-10-11|last=Heimer|first=Željko|date=2 July 2006|work=Flags of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt; A flag with three colours, Saffron, White and Green with the Ashoka Chakra was selected.

===Pillars of Ashoka (Ashokstambha)===
{{Main|Pillars of Ashoka}}
[[Image:CotthapAduc.gif|left|upright|thumb|left|The Asokan pillar at [[Lumbini]], [[Nepal]]]]
The pillars of Ashoka are a series of columns dispersed throughout the northern Indian subcontinent, and erected by Ashoka during his reign in the 3rd century BC. Originally, there must have been many pillars of Ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive. Averaging between forty and fifty feet in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all the pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged, sometimes hundreds of miles, to where they were erected. The first Pillar of Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient Delhi. The wheel represents the sun time and Buddhist law, while the [[swastika]] stands for the cosmic dance around a fixed center and guards against evil.
There is no evidence of a swastika, or manji, on the pillars.
[[File:Ashok Sthamba.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Asokan pillar at [[Lumbini]], [[Nepal]]]]

===Lion Capital of Asoka (Ashokmudra)===
{{Main|Lion Capital of Asoka}}
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka.jpg|thumb|200px|This is the famous original sandstone sculpted [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] preserved at [[Sarnath Museum]] which was originally erected around 250 BC atop an [[Ashoka Pillar]] at [[Sarnath]]. The angle from which this picture has been taken, minus the [[inverted bell]]-shaped [[Indian lotus|lotus]] flower, has been adopted as the [[National Emblem of India]] showing the Horse on the left and the Bull on the right of the [[Ashoka Chakra]] in the circular base on which the four [[Indian lion]]s are standing back to back. On the far side there is an Elephant and a Lion instead. The wheel &quot;Ashoka Chakra&quot; from its base has been placed onto the center of the [[National Flag of India]].]] --&gt;

The Lion capital of Ashoka is a sculpture of four &quot;Indian [[lions]]&quot; standing back to back. It was originally placed atop the Aśoka pillar at [[Sarnath]], now in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. The pillar, sometimes called the Aśoka Column is still in its original location, but the Lion Capital is now in the [[Sarnath Museum]]. This Lion Capital of Ashoka from Sarnath has been adopted as the National Emblem of India and the wheel &quot;[[Ashoka Chakra]]&quot; from its base was placed onto the center of the [[National Flag of India]].

The capital contains four lions (Indian / Asiatic Lions), standing back to back, mounted on an abacus, with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull, and a lion, separated by intervening spoked chariot-wheels over a bell-shaped lotus. Carved out of a single block of polished sandstone, the capital was believed to be crowned by a 'Wheel of Dharma' (Dharmachakra popularly known in India as the &quot;Ashoka Chakra&quot;).

The Ashoka Lion capital or the Sarnath lion capital is also known as the national symbol of India. The Sarnath pillar bears one of the Edicts of Ashoka, an inscription against division within the Buddhist community, which reads, &quot;No one shall cause division in the order of monks&quot;. The Sarnath pillar is a column surmounted by a capital, which consists of a canopy representing an inverted bell-shaped lotus flower, a short cylindrical abacus with four 24-spoked Dharma wheels with four animals (an [[elephant]], a [[bull]], a [[horse]], a [[lion]]).

The four animals in the Sarnath capital are believed to symbolize different steps of Lord [[Buddha]]'s life.
* The Elephant represents the Buddha's idea in reference to the dream of Queen Maya of a white elephant entering her womb.
* The Bull represents desire during the life of the Buddha as a prince.
* The Horse represents Buddha's departure from palatial life.
* The Lion represents the accomplishment of Buddha.

Besides the religious interpretations, there are some non-religious interpretations also about the symbolism of the Ashoka capital pillar at Sarnath. According to them, the four lions symbolize Ashoka's rule over the four directions, the wheels as symbols of his enlightened rule (Chakravartin) and the four animals as symbols of four adjoining territories of [[India]].

===Attributed to Ashoka===
[[File:6thPillarOfAshoka.JPG|thumb|350px|Fragment of the sixth Pillar Edicts of Ashoka (238 BC), in [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]], sandstones. [[British Museum]].]]

* All men are my children. What I desire for my own children, and I desire their welfare and happiness both in this world and the next, which I desire for all men. You do not understand to what extent I desire this, and if some of you do understand, you do not understand the full extent of my desire.

* Here (in my domain) no living beings are to be slaughtered or offered in sacrifice.

* Respect for mother and father is good, generosity to friends, acquaintances, relatives, Brahmans and ascetics is good, not killing living beings is good, moderation in spending and moderation in saving is good.

* To do good is difficult. One who does good first does something hard to do. I have done many good deeds, and, if my sons, grandsons and their descendants up to the end of the world act in like manner, they too will do much good. But whoever amongst them neglects this, they will do evil.
Truly, it is easy to do evil.

* All religions should reside everywhere, for all of them desire self-control and purity of heart.

* King Piyadasi does not consider glory and fame to be of great account unless they are achieved through having my subjects respect Dhamma and practice Dhamma, both now and in the future.

* Whoever praises his own religion, due to excessive devotion, and condemns others with the thought &quot;Let me glorify my own religion,&quot; only harms his own religion. Therefore contact (between religions) is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others.

* There is no gift like the gift of the Dhamma, (no acquaintance like) acquaintance with Dhamma, (no distribution like) distribution of Dhamma, and (no kinship like) kinship through Dhamma. And it consists of this: proper behavior towards servants and employees, respect for mother and father, generosity to friends, companions, relations, Brahmans and ascetics, and not killing living beings.

* King Piyadasi, honors both ascetics and the householders of all religions, and he honors them with gifts and honors of various kinds.But Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, does not value gifts and honors as much as he values this—that there should be growth in the essentials of all religions.

* Along roads I have had banyan trees planted so that they can give shade to animals and men, and I have had mango groves planted. At intervals of eight //krosas//, I have had wells dug, rest-houses built, and in various places, I have had watering-places made for the use of animals and men. But these are but minor achievements. Such things to make the people happy have been done by former kings. I have done these things for this purpose, that the people might practice the Dhamma.

* It is my desire that there should be uniformity in law and uniformity in sentencing. I even go this far, to grant a three-day stay for those in prison who have been tried and sentenced to death. During this time their relatives can make appeals to have the prisoners' lives spared. If there is none to appeal on their behalf, the prisoners can give gifts in order to make merit for the next world, or observe fasts.&lt;ref&gt;These quotations are taken directly from the [[Edicts of Ashoka]].

[[H. G. Wells]] in his bestselling two-volume work, [[The Outline of History]] (1920), wrote of emperor Ashoka:
{{quote|In the history of the world there have been thousands of kings and emperors who called themselves 'their highnesses,' 'their majesties,' and 'their exalted majesties' and so on. They shone for a brief moment, and as quickly disappeared. But Ashoka shines and shines brightly like a bright star, even unto this day.}}

* &quot;There is the only one period in Indian history which is a period of freedom, greatness and glory. That is the period of the Mauryan empire (Ashoka's empire).&quot; – [[B. R. Ambedkar]] in Annihilation of Caste (page no. 70–71).

* &quot;Ashoka is perhaps the only emperor who hated wars because of the blood shed and cruelty. He wanted to win the souls of people with love not the bodies with sword and terror.&quot; – [[V. G. Gokhale]].

* &quot;In some cases Ashoka may be compared with [[Alexander]], [[Augustus Caesar]], [[Genghis Khan]], [[Timur]], [[Peter I of Russia]], [[Napoleon I]]. But Ashoka was not extra ambitious like Alexander. Ashoka was an ideal administrator like Augustus Caesar, but unlike Caesar, he didn't want to be known as a dictator. Ashoka was a strong general but unlike Napoleon I Ashoka never was unsatisfied. Ashoka  wanted to be loved by his subjects. He never terrorized his subjects like Genghis Khan, Timur and Peter I of Russia. Nobility of soul, purity of mind, honesty of nature, clarity of dignity and love for all let Ashoka sit with [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Jesus Christ]].&quot; – [[Madhav Kondvilkar]] in Devancha Priya Raja Priyadarshi Samrath Ashok (page no. 19).

* &quot;Nowadays wars, conflicts and blood shed have become very familiar, but about two thousand years ago Ashoka comprehended the evils of war and conflicts. Ashoka turned his all power to establish harmony and peace, in this way he has put a fine example to be followed before all mankind. In this way he has shown that in peacetime man would be a progressed being.&quot; – Dr. [[Binda Paranjape]] in Ashokache Shilalekha (page no.29).

* &quot;A hundred years after my death there will be an emperor named Ashoka in Pataliputra. He will rule one of the four continents and adorn Jambudvipa (old name to India) with my relics, building eighty four thousand stupas for the welfare of people. He will have them honored by gods and men. His fame will be widespread. His meritorious gift was just this: Jaya threw a handful of dust into the Tathaagata's bowl.&quot; Prediction of [[Buddha]] for Ashoka according to the [[Ashokavadana]].

He had invaded Kalinga (255 B.C.), a country along the east coast of Madras, perhaps with some intention of completing the conquest of the tip of the Indian peninsula. The expedition was successful, but he was disgusted by what be saw of the cruelties and horrors of war. He declared, in certain inscriptions that still exist, that he would no longer seek conquest by war, but by religion, and the rest of his life was devoted to the spreading of Buddhism throughout the world. He seems to have ruled his vast empire in peace and with great ability. He was no mere religious fanatic. For eight and twenty years Asoka worked sanely for the real needs of men. Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Asoka shines, and shines, almost alone, a star. From the Volga to Japan his name is still honored. China, Tibet, and even India, though it has left his doctrine, preserve the tradition of his greatness. More living men cherish his memory today than have ever heard the names of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] or [[Charlemagne]].&quot; – [[H.G. Wells]] in [[The Outline of History]] (Being a Plain History of Life and Mankind) published in (1920) chapter no. 25.4 (Buddhism and Asoka) page no 365–366.

* &quot;A large number of international scholars agree that Emperor Aśoka of India in the third century B.C. was one of the conquerors who later achieved the most difficult conquest of all — the conquest of himself — through self-conviction and his perception of human suffering. After embracing the Dhamma of the Buddha as his guide and refuge, he transformed the goal of his regime from military conquest to conquest by [[Dhamma]]. By providing royal patronage for the propagation of Buddhism both within and outside his vast dominion, he helped promote the metamorphosis of Buddhism from one among many sects of Indian ascetic spirituality into a world religion that was eventually to penetrate almost all of southern and eastern Asia.&quot; – [[Anuradha Seneviratna]] in King Asoka and Buddhism Historical &amp; Literary Studies (editors preface ) (page. no. xi). [[File:Taxila1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Dharmarajika]] stupa, Taxila, Pakistan is Commissioned under Ashoka.]]

* &quot;We have no way of knowing how effective Asoka’s reforms were or how long they lasted but we do know that monarchs throughout the ancient Buddhist world were encouraged to look to his style of government as an ideal to be followed. King Asoka has to be credited with first attempt to develop a Buddhist  polity. Today, with widespread disillusionment in prevailing ideologies and the search for a political philosophy that goes beyond greed,  hatred, and delusion, Asoka’s edicts may make a meaningful contribution to development of a more spiritually based political system.&quot; – [[Ven. S. Dhammika]] in The Edicts of Ashoka.

* &quot;Many people ask: How can any nation be defended if all of its people adopt nonviolence? It is rather difficult to answer this hypothetical question. However, an emperor ruled over India with nonviolence and compassion in the third century B.C. Ashoka was the emperor - emperor of peace and social justice. He did not rule by force or by accumulating goods and means of comfort for himself or by pomp and show. He ruled by sacrificing material comforts and by treating all his subjects equal and with justice. His example can guide us, rulers and administrators, politicians and civil servants, religious leaders and laymen, to establish peace, justice and harmony in present-day world.&quot; – Sh. [[Duli Chandra Jain]] and Ms. [[Sunita Jain]] in Ashoka - Emperor Or Monk.

* &quot;Ashoka was a man dedicated to peace, and the only emperor in history to forsake warfare after victory in the Kalinga war, devoting the balance of his lifetime serving not only his people, but mankind, with magnanimity and benevolence seldom seen in history. Thus he was able to build the Golden Period of Indian history.&quot; – Dr. [[Kirthisinghe]].

===In art, film and literature===
* ''[[Asoka (2001 film)|Asoka]]'' is a 2001 epic [[Bollywood]] historical drama. It is a largely fictional version of the life of the Indian emperor Ashoka. The film was directed by [[Santosh Sivan]] and stars [[Shahrukh Khan]] as Ashoka and [[Kareena Kapoor]] as Kaurwaki, a princess of Kalinga.The film ends with Asoka renouncing the sword and embracing Buddhism. The final narrative describes how Asoka not only built a large empire, but spread Buddhism and the winds of peace through it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The meaning of the word '''''American''''' in the [[English language]] varies, according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. It is derived from ''[[Americas|America]]'', a term originally denoting all of the [[New World]] (also called &quot;the [[Americas]]&quot;). In some expressions it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the [[United States|United States of America]]. In modern English, &quot;American&quot; generally refers to the United States, and in the U.S. itself this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification of the subject under discussion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;Wilson, Kenneth G. (1993). ''The Columbia Guide to Standard American English'' New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 27–28. ISBN 0-231-06989-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mencken&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first = H. L. | last = Mencken | title = Names for Americans | journal = American Speech | volume = 22 | number = 4 | month = December | year = 1947 | pages = 241&amp;ndash;256 | doi = 10.2307/486658 | issue = 4 | publisher = American Speech, Vol. 22, No. 4 | jstor=486658}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gage&quot;&gt;Walter S. Avis, Patrick D. Drysdale, Robert J. Gregg, Victoria E. Eeufeldt, Mattheew H. Scargill (1983). ''Gage Canadian Dictionary''. Toronto: Gage Publishing Limited, p. 37. ISBN 0-7715-9122-5 pbk.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word can be used as both a [[noun]] and an [[adjective]]. In adjectival use, it is generally understood to mean &quot;of or relating to the United States&quot;; for example, &quot;[[Elvis Presley]] was an American singer&quot; or &quot;the American President gave a speech today.&quot; In noun form, it generally means [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizen or national]] (see [[Names for U.S. citizens]]). The noun is rarely used in [[American English]] to refer to people not connected to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt; When used with a [[Grammatical modifier|grammatical qualifier]], the adjective ''American'' can mean &quot;of or relating to the Americas,&quot; as in [[Latin America]]n or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]]. Less frequently, the adjective can take this meaning without a qualifier, as in &quot;[[Spanish dialects and varieties|American Spanish]] dialects and pronunciation differ by country&quot;, or the name of the [[Organization of American States]]. A third use of the term pertains specifically to the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], for instance, &quot;In the 16th century, many Americans died from imported diseases during the European conquest&quot;.

==Other languages==
The [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], and [[Italian language|Italian]] languages use [[cognates]] of the word &quot;American&quot;, in denoting &quot;U.S. citizen&quot;. In Spanish, ''americano'' denotes geographic and cultural origin in the New World; the adjective and noun, denoting a U.S. national, ''[[estadounidense]]'' (United States person), derives from ''Estados Unidos de América'' (United States of America). Such usage is slightly more descriptive than &quot;American&quot;, but also not sufficiently specific to the United States of America, since it would be equally applicable to citizens of Mexico, which is officially named Estados Unidos Mexicanos (United Mexican States). The Spanish term ''norteamericano'' (North American), is frequently used to refer things and persons from the United States, but the term usage is not accurate, because the term can also denote things and persons from Canada, Mexico, Greenland, Bermuda and St Pierre and Miquelon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española]], [http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=norteamericano norteamericano]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Spanish words ''[[estadounidense]]'' (United States person), ''yanqui'' (Yankee), and [[gringo]] are Mexican, Central American, Caribbean, South American and European Spanish usages denoting U.S. things and persons. In personal denotation, &quot;gringo&quot; means a ''estadounidense'', in particular, and anglophones in general, and, linguistically, any speech not Spanish, i.e. &quot;She is speaking gringo, not Spanish&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española]], [http://rae.es/gringo gringo], second aception: &quot;said of a language: foreign&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Cognate usages may cause cultural friction between U.S. nationals and Latin Americans who object to American English's exclusionary denotations of ''American''.

Portuguese has ''americano'', denoting a person or thing from the Americas, and for a U.S. national and things ''estadunidense'' (United States person), from ''Estados Unidos da América'', and ''ianque'' (Yankee), but the term most often used is ''norte-americano'', even though it could, as with its Spanish equivalent, in theory apply to Canadians, Mexicans, etc., as well. In French, ''étasunien'',{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} from ''États-Unis d'Amérique'', distinguishes U.S. things and persons from the adjective ''américain'', which denotes persons and things from the United States but may also refer to ''the Americas''; likewise, the German usages ''U.S.-amerikanisch'' and ''U.S.-Amerikaner''{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} observe said cultural distinction, solely denoting U.S. things and people. It is important to note that these are &quot;politically correct&quot; terms and that in normal parlance, the adjective &quot;American&quot; and its direct cognates are almost always used unless the context does not render the nationality of the person clear. For example, the word &quot;Amerika&quot; in German has a one-to-one equivalence to its meaning in modern English: it may denote North America, South America, or both, and in some instances refers to the United States.

==History of the word==
[[Image:Bowen America.png|thumb|300px|British Map of America in 1744.]]

The derivation of ''America'' has several explanatory [[Americas#Naming|naming theories]]. The most common is [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s deriving it from ''Americus Vespucius'', the Latinised version of [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s name, the Italian merchant and cartographer who explored South America's east coast and the [[Caribbean]] sea in the early 16th century. Later, his published letters were the basis of [[Waldseemüller map|Waldseemüller's 1507 map]], which is the first usage of ''America''. (See {{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|title=The Naming of America: Vespucci's Good Name|url=http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/his/COHEN-01.HIS|accessdate=2007-06-26}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}})

In 1886, [[Jules Marcou]] said Vespucci renamed himself from ''Alberigo'' Vespucci (''Albericus Vespucius'') to ''Amerigo'' Vespucci after meeting the native inhabitants of the eponymous [[Amerrique]] mountain ranges of Nicaragua{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} that connect North America and South America, an important geographic feature of [[New World]] maps and charts. Moreover, there is the 1908 theory that ''America'' derives from [[Richard Amerike]] of Bristol, England, financier of [[John Cabot]]'s 1497 expedition. Cabot is believed the first Western European on the mainland. In the event, the adjective ''American'' subsequently denotes the New World's peoples and things.


16th-century European usage of ''American'' denoted the native inhabitants of the New World.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com.dax.lib.unf.edu/cgi/entry/50007152?query_type=word&amp;queryword=American&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=870u-gw0naW-7329&amp;hilite=50007152 &quot;American&quot;]. From the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. Retrieved November 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of this term in English is in [[Thomas Hacket]]'s 1568 translation of [[André Thévet]]'s book on ''[[France Antarctique]]''; Thévet himself had referred to the natives as ''Ameriques''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt; In the following century the term was extended to European settlers and their descendants in the Americas. The earliest recorded use of this term in English dates to 1648, in [[Thomas Gage (clergyman)|Thomas Gage]]'s ''The English-American: A New Survet of the West Indies''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt; In English, &quot;American&quot; was used especially for people in the [[British America]], and came to be applied to citizens of the United States when the country was formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt; The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] refers to &quot;[the] unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America&quot; adopted by the &quot;Representatives of the united States of America&quot; on July 4, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/national-archives-experience/charters/charters_downloads.html|title=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official name of the country was established on November 15, 1777, when the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], the first of which says, &quot;The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America' &quot;. The confederation articles further state: &quot;In Witness whereof we have hereunto set our hands in Congress. Done at Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania the ninth day of July in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Seventy-Eight, and in the Third Year of the independence of America.&quot; Common short forms and abbreviations are the ''United States'', the ''U.S.'', the ''U.S.A.'', and ''America''. Colloquial versions are the ''U.S. of A.'' and ''the States''. The term ''[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]'' (from the Columbus surname), was a popular name for the U.S. and for the entire geographic Americas; its usage is restricted to the District of Columbia name. Moreover, the womanly personification of Columbia appears in some official documents, including editions of the U.S. dollar.

In the [[Federalist Papers]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]] use ''American'' with two different meanings, political and geographic; &quot;the American republic&quot; in Federalist Paper 51 and in Federalist Paper 70,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm|title=The Federalist no. 51|author=James Madison}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Federalist_No._70|author=Alexander Hamilton|title=The Federalist no. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in Federalist Paper 24, Hamilton's ''American'' usage denotes the lands beyond the U.S.'s political borders:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Alexander | last = Hamilton | journal = The Federalist Papers | volume = 24 | url = http://www.law.ou.edu/hist/federalist/federalist-20-29/federalist.24.shtml | title = The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States President [[George Washington]]'s farewell in 1796 says: &quot;The name of American, which belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp &quot;Washington's Farewell Address 1796&quot;].

Originally, the name &quot;the United States&quot; was plural—&quot;the United States are&quot;—a usage found in the U.S. Constitution's [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] (1865), but its current common usage is singular—&quot;the United States is&quot;. The plural is set in the idiom &quot;these United States&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002663.html |last = Zimmer |first = Benjamin |authorlink = Benjamin Zimmer |date=2005-11-24|title=Life in These, Uh, This United States |work = [[Language Log]] |publisher =[[University of Pennsylvania]] |accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Constitutional Convention, several country names were proffered, the most popular being &quot;[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]&quot;. The problems of &quot;the United States of America&quot; as a name (long, awkward, imprecise) were discussed; the Constitution ignores the matter, using &quot;the United States of America&quot; and &quot;the United States&quot;. The name &quot;Colombia&quot; (derived from Christopher Columbus; Sp: ''Cristóbal Colón'', It: ''Cristoforo Colombo''), was proposed by the revolutionary [[Francisco de Miranda]] to denote the New World—especially Spain's and Portugal's American territories and colonies; it was used in the country names [[Gran Colombia|Republic of Columbia]] and the [[United States of Colombia]].

Early official U.S. documents betray inconsistent usage; the 1778 [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]] with [[France]] uses &quot;the United States of North America&quot; in the first sentence, then uses &quot;the said United States&quot; afterwards; &quot;the United States of America&quot; and &quot;the United States of North America&quot; derive from &quot;the United Colonies of America&quot; and &quot;the United Colonies of North America&quot;. The Treaty of Peace and Amity of September 5, 1795 between the United States and the [[Barbary States]] contains the usages &quot;the United States of North America&quot;, &quot;citizens of the United States&quot;, and &quot;American Citizens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/barbary/bar1795t.htm | title = The Barbary Treaties: Treaty of Peace and Amity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semantic divergence among Anglophones did not affect the Spanish colonies. In 1801, the document titled ''Letter to American Spaniards''—published in French (1799), in Spanish (1801), and in English (1808)—might have influenced [[Venezuela]]'s [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|Act of Independence]] and its 1811 constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.histal.umontreal.ca/espanol/documentos/la%20carta%20dirigida%20a%20los%20espanoles%20americanos.htm | title = La “Carta dirigida a los españoles americanos”, una carta que recorrió muchos caminos...}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage at the United Nations==
Use of the term ''American'' for U.S. nationals is common in [[United Nations]]. The Secretary General refers to people from the United States as Americans, as has the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30715&amp;Cr=appointment&amp;Cr1=experience&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/works/sub3.asp?lang=en&amp;id=123&lt;/ref&gt; The UN has referred to financial markets in the United States as &quot;American financial markets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2009/090326_GA.doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and cultural views===
====Spain and Hispanic America====
The use of ''American'' as a national [[demonym]] for U.S. nationals is challenged, primarily by Latin Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mencken&quot;/&gt; Many Spanish speakers in Latin America use the term ''estadounidense''&lt;ref name=&quot;DRAE-estadounidense&quot;&gt;[[Real Academia Española]], ''Diccionario de la lengua española'', 2001, [http://rae.es/estadounidense estadounidense]&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;United-Statesian&quot;) rather than ''americano''. The dictionary of [[Real Academia Española]] in 1992 did not include the alternative ''from the United States'' as one of the meanings of ''americano''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Real Academia Española]], ''Diccionario usual'', 1992, p. 89. Available beginning from http://buscon.rae.es/ntlle/SrvltGUILoginNtlle and using the magnifying glass icon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Real Academia Española]], ''Diccionario de la lengua española'', 2001, [http://rae.es/americano americano], fourth edition (not present in 1992) defines ''americano'' as ''estadounidense''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española|Diccionario de la Lengua Española]]'' (Dictionary of the Spanish Language) published by the [[Real Academia Española]] (Royal Spanish Academy), defines ''estadounidense'' (United Statesian) as &quot;someone or something from or relating to the United States&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;DRAE-estadounidense&quot;/&gt; the common Spanish usage for U.S. people and things. People originating from, or who have lived in, the Western Hemisphere might be called ''americanos''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Real Academia Española]], ''Diccionario de la lengua española'', 2001, [http://rae.es/americano americano], first edition defines ''americano'' as ''from América (the continent)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the Royal Spanish Academy advises against using ''americanos'' exclusively for U.S. nationals:&lt;ref&gt;''Diccionario panhispánico de dudas'', [http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=Estados%20Unidos Estados Unidos]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Pero debe evitarse el empleo de ''americano'' para referirse exclusivamente a los habitantes de los Estados Unidos, uso abusivo que se explica por el hecho de que los estadounidenses utilizan a menudo el nombre abreviado ''América'' (en inglés, sin tilde) para referirse a su país. No debe olvidarse que ''América'' es el nombre de todo el continente y son americanos todos los que lo habitan.}}

English translation:

{{quotation|But the use of ''americano'' to refer exclusively to inhabitants of the United States should be avoided; this abusive usage is explained by the fact that U.S. citizens often use the abbreviated name ''América'' (in English, without an accent) to refer to their country. One should not forget that ''América'' is the name of the entire continent and all who inhabit it are ''americanos''.}}

====Canada====
Prior to [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, the word &quot;Canadian&quot; referred only to residents of the [[Canada, New France|colony of Canada]], which consisted of the territory of modern [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]. The term did not apply to residents of the colonies of [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]] or [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Collectively, the British colonies were known as [[British North America]], and their residents referred to themselves as &quot;British Americans.&quot; Since the War of 1812, the term &quot;American&quot; acquired a pejorative context within Canada.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Even since the [[BNA Act]] of 1867, which defines the word [[Canada]] in its modern context, the pejorative context of the term &quot;American&quot; remains widespread.

Modern Canadians typically refer to people from the United States as &quot;Americans&quot;, though they seldom refer to the United States as &quot;America&quot;, using the terms &quot;the United States&quot;, &quot;the U.S.&quot;, or (informally) &quot;the States&quot; instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxfcdn&quot;&gt;Fee, Margery and McAlpine, J. 1997. ''Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage.'' (ISBN 0-19-541619-8) Toronto: Oxford University Press; p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Canadians rarely apply the term &quot;American&quot; to themselves – some Canadians resent being referred to as Americans because of mistaken assumptions that they are U.S. citizens or an inability, particularly of people overseas, to distinguish [[Canadian English]] and [[American English]] [[accent (linguistics)|accents]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxfcdn&quot; /&gt; Some Canadians have protested the use of ''American'' as a national demonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Ford|first=Miriam Allen|year=1927|month=April|title=On the difficulty of indicating nativity in the United States|journal=American Speech|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; People of U.S. ethnic origin in Canada are categorized as &quot;American (U.S.)&quot; by [[Statistics Canada]] for purposes of [[census]] counts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&amp;PID=62911&amp;APATH=3&amp;GID=431515&amp;METH=1&amp;PTYPE=55440&amp;THEME=44&amp;FOCUS=0&amp;AID=0&amp;PLACENAME=0&amp;PROVINCE=0&amp;SEARCH=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;FL=0&amp;RL=0&amp;FREE=0 97F0010XCB2001001&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portugal and Brazil====
Generally, ''Americano'' denotes &quot;U.S. citizen&quot; in [[Portugal]]. Usage of ''americano'' to exclusively denote people and things of the U.S. is discouraged by the Academia das Ciências de Lisboa (Lisbon Academy of Sciences), because the specific word ''estado-unidense'' (also ''estadunidense'') clearly denotes a &quot;United Statesman&quot; and a &quot;United Stateswoman&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The term currently used by the Portuguese press is ''norte-americano''.

In Brazil, the term ''americano'' (American) is used to address both that which pertains to the American continent and, in current speech, that which pertains to the U.S.A. (the particular meaning is deduced from context). Alternatively the term &quot;norte-americano&quot; (North American) is also used in more informal contexts while &quot;estadunidense&quot; (United-Statesman) is the preferred form in academia. The term &quot;América&quot; (America) on the other hand is used almost exclusevily for the continent as the U.S.A. are called &quot;Estados Unidos&quot; (United States) or &quot;Estados Unidos da América&quot; (United States of America).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Getting Through Customs website advises business travellers not to use &quot;in America&quot; as a U.S. reference when conducting business in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Morrison| first =Terri| authorlink =|coauthors =|title =Doing business abroad - Brazil| work =| publisher =| date =|

====United States====&lt;!--this section is linked from another article, don't change its title without consulting &quot;What links here&quot;--&gt;
[[Image:American1346.gif|thumb|&quot;United States or American&quot; ancestry by county, per 2000 U.S. Census. (Dark colors represent higher relative density)]]
The [[United States Census Bureau]] reports 7.3 percent of U.S. residents to be of &quot;United States or American&quot; ancestry&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-state=qt&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&amp;-CONTEXT=qt&amp;-_caller=geoselect&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en United States - QT-P13. Ancestry: 2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; based on responses to the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]] long-form questionnaire (1 in 6 sample). Discrete responses of ''United States'' and ''American'' or an ambiguous response or a state-name response (excluding Hawaii) were aggregated as &quot;United States or American&quot;. Distinct racial, ethnic, and cultural groups such as &quot;[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]&quot;, &quot;[[Mexican American]]&quot;, &quot;[[African American]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]]&quot; were coded separately.

The word &quot;American&quot; appears in the name of the U.S. territory of [[American Samoa]].&lt;ref name=UN/&gt; American Samoa began using the word ''American'' in its title when it became a U.S. territory.

==''American'' in other contexts==
''American'' in the ''[[AP Stylebook|Associated Press Stylebook]]'' (1994) is defined as: &quot;An acceptable description for a resident of the United States. It also may be applied to any resident or citizen of nations in North or South America&quot;. Elsewhere, the ''AP Stylebook'' indicates that &quot;United States&quot; must &quot;be spelled out when used as a noun. Use U.S. (no space) only as an adjective&quot;.

''[[The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage]]'' (1999) ''America'' entry reads: the &quot;terms ''America'', ''American(s)'' and ''Americas'' refer not only to the United States, but to all of North America and South America. They may be used in any of their senses, including references to just the United States, if the context is clear. The countries of the Western Hemisphere are collectively ''the Americas'' &quot;.

Media releases from the [[Pope]] and [[Holy See]] frequently use ''America'' to refer to the United States, and ''American'' to denote something or someone from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/homilies/1965/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19651004_yankee-stadium_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===''American'' in international law===
At least one international law uses &quot;U.S. citizen&quot; in defining a citizen of the United States rather than ''American citizen'' such as this excerpt from the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]:

{{quotation|Only air carriers that are U.S. citizens are permitted to operate domestic air services or operate international air services as a &quot;U.S.&quot; carrier; non-U.S. citizens may own and control foreign air carriers that operate between the U.S. and foreign points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=34859&amp;pageno=12 | title = North American Free Trade Agreement |date= October 7, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many other international treaties use the term ''American'' and ''American citizen''. The [[Thailand]] Treaty of Amity protects Americans and American companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buyusa.gov/thailand/en/treatyofamity.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Treaty between the United States and the [[Dey]] of the Regency of [[Algiers]] on March 7, 1796 protected ''American citizens''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.org/georgewashington/collection/pres_1796mar7.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Louisiana Purchase Treaty between [[France]] and United States referred to ''American citizens''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/resources/archives/one/louispur.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The 1858 [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States-Japan)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] between the United States and [[Japan]] protected ''American citizens'' and also used the term ''American''.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~jobrien/reference/ob58.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] between [[Mexico]] and the U.S. uses the term ''American Government'' to refer to the United States, and ''American tribunals'' to refer to U.S. courts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/september21/treaty.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The 1825 treaty between the United States and the [[Cheyenne]] tribe refers to ''American citizen''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Treaties/TreatyWithTheCheyenneTribe1825.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] ending the [[Spanish-American War]], known as ''Guerra Hispano-Estadounidense'' in Spanish, uses the word ''American'' in reference to United States troops.&lt;ref&gt;http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1898.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===''American'' in U.S. commercial regulation===
Products that are labelled, advertised, and marketed in the U.S. as &quot;[[Made in USA label|American Made]]&quot; must be &quot;all or virtually all made in the U.S.&quot; The Federal Trade Commission, to prevent deception of customers and unfair competition, considers an unqualified claim of &quot;American Made&quot; to expressly claim exclusive manufacture in the U.S. &quot;The [[FTC Act]] gives the Commission the power to bring law enforcement actions against false or misleading claims that a product is of U.S. origin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/madeusa.htm Complying with the Made In the USA Standard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''U.S. national'' in other languages==
[[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]],&lt;ref&gt;Japanese: アメリカ人 ''amerika-jin''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Russian language|Russian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-ru|американец, американка,}}&lt;/ref&gt; speakers may use the term ''American'' to refer to either inhabitants of the Americas or to U.S. nationals. They generally have other terms specific to U.S. nationals, such as German ''US-Amerikaner'', French ''étatsunien'', Japanese 米国人 ''beikokujin'', Arabic أمريكاني ''amriikaanii'' (as opposed to the more-common أمريكي ''amriikii''), and Italian ''statunitense'', but these may be less common than the term ''American''. Adjectives derived from &quot;United States&quot; (such as ''United Statesian)'' are awkward in English, but similar constructions exist in Spanish (''estadounidense''), Portuguese (''estado-unidense'', ''estadunidense''), [[Finnish language|Finnish]] (''yhdysvaltalainen'': from ''Yhdysvallat'', United States), as well as in French (''états-unien''), and Italian (''statunitense'').

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], at least one reference reports ''estadounidense'', ''estado-unidense'' or ''estadunidense'' are preferred to ''americano'' for U.S. nationals; the latter tends to refer to any resident of the Americas and not necessarily from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Pequeño Larousse Ilustrado 1992 edition, look up word Americano: Contains the Observation: Debe evitarse el empleo de americano con el sentido de norteamericano o de los Estados Unidos (trans. Usage of the word with the meaning of U.S. citizen or the United States must be avoided) | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Portuguese, ''estado-unidense''(or estadunidense) is the recommended form by language regulators but today it is less frequently used than ''americano'' and ''norte-americano''.
Latin Americans also may employ the term ''norteamericano'' (''North American''), which conflates the United States and Canada.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

With the 1994 passage of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], the following words were used to label the ''United States Section'' of that organization: in French, ''étatsunien''; in Spanish, ''estadounidense''. In English the adjective used to indicate relation to the United States is ''U.S.''{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The word [[Gringo]] is widely used in parts of [[Latin America]] in reference to U.S. residents, often in a pejorative way but not necessarily. ''Yanqui'' (''[[Yankee]]'') is also very common in some regions, but it is usually pejorative. Throughout Latin America the word ''Gringo'' is also used for any foreigner from the United States, Canada, or Europe, however the true sense of the word is any foreigner.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In other languages, however, there is no possibility for confusion. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''měiguórén''&lt;ref&gt;Standard Mandarin pronunciation; written 美國人 (traditional), 美国人 (simplified)&lt;/ref&gt; for example, is derived from a word for the United States, ''měiguó'', where ''měi'' is an abbreviation for ''Yàměilìjiā'' &quot;America&quot; and ''guó'' is &quot;country&quot;. The name for the continent of America is ''měizhōu'',&lt;ref&gt;美洲&lt;/ref&gt; from ''měi'' plus ''zhōu'' &quot;continent&quot;. Thus a ''měi'''zhōu'''rén'' is an American in the generic sense, and a ''měi'''guó'''rén'' is an American in the U.S. sense. Similar words are found in Korean&lt;ref&gt;미국(인) ''Migug(in)'' vs. 아메리카(인) ''Amerika(in)''&lt;/ref&gt; and Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;''(người) Hoa Kỳ'' 花旗 vs. ''(người) Châu Mỹ'' 洲美; the term for the U.S. is taken from its flag.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Japanese has such terms as well, 米国(人) ''beikoku(jin)'' vs. 米洲人 ''beishū(jin)'', but they are found more in newspaper headlines than in speech, where ''amerikajin'' predominates.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the more naturalized word ''Marekani'' means specifically the United States, and ''Wamarekani'' are U.S. nationals, whereas the international form ''Amerika'' refers to the continent, and ''Waamerika'' are the inhabitants thereof. Likewise, the [[Esperanto]] word ''Ameriko'' refers only to the continent. For the country there is the term ''Usono'', cognate with the English word ''[[Usonia]]'' later popularized by Frank Lloyd Wright. Thus a citizen of the United States is an ''usonano'', whereas an ''amerikano'' is an inhabitant of the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Alternative adjectives for U.S. citizens==
{{Main|Names for U.S. citizens}}
There are a number of alternatives to the [[demonym]] &quot;American&quot; (a citizen of the United States) that do not simultaneously mean any inhabitant of the Americas. One uncommon alternative is &quot;[[Usonian]]&quot;, which usually describes a certain style of residential [[architecture]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Over the years, many other alternatives have also surfaced, but most have long fallen into disuse and obscurity. ''[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage]]'' says, &quot;The list contains (in approximate historical order from 1789 to 1939) such terms as Columbian, Columbard, Fredonian, Frede, Unisian, United Statesian, Colonican, Appalacian, Usian, Washingtonian, Usonian, Uessian, U-S-ian, Uesican, United Stater.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', p. 88. Merriam-Webster: 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, no alternative to &quot;American&quot; is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Columbia Guide to Standard American English | url = http://www.bartleby.com/68/37/337.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ada''' is a [[structured programming|structured]], [[statically typed]], [[Imperative programming|imperative]], [[wide-spectrum language|wide-spectrum]], and [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[high-level language|high-level]] [[computer programming|computer]] [[programming language]], extended from [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and other languages. It has strong built-in language support for explicit concurrency, offering tasks, synchronous message passing (via guarded task entries), protected objects (a monitor-like construct with additional guards as in conditional critical regions) and nondeterminism (via ''select'' statements).  

Ada was originally designed by a team led by [[Jean Ichbiah]] of [[Groupe Bull|CII Honeywell Bull]] under contract to the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) from 1977 to 1983 to supersede the hundreds of programming languages then used by the DoD.  Ada is [[strongly typed languages|strongly typed]] and compilers are validated for reliability in mission-critical applications, such as [[avionics]] software. Ada is an international standard; the current version (known as Ada 2005) is defined by joint ISO/ANSI standard,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adaic.org/resources/add_content/standards/95lrm/ARM_HTML/RM-TTL.html ISO-8652:1995]&lt;/ref&gt; combined with major Amendment ISO/IEC 8652:1995/Amd 1:2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=45001 ISO/IEC 8652:1995/Amd 1:2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ada was named after [[Ada Lovelace]] (1815–1852), who is often credited as being the first computer programmer.&lt;ref&gt;J. Fuegi and J. Francis, &quot;Lovelace &amp; Babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes'.&quot; Annals of the History of Computing 25 #4 (October–December 2003): 16-26.

Tucker Taft]] of [[Intermetrics]] between 1992 and 1995, improved support for systems, numerical, financial, and [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP).

Notable features of Ada include: [[strongly typed languages|strong typing]], [[modularity (programming)|modularity mechanisms]] (packages), [[run-time checking]], [[parallel processing]] ([[Task (computing)|tasks]], synchronous [[Message passing]], [[protected objects]] and nondeterministic [[select statement]]s), [[exception handling]], and [[generic programming|generic]]s. Ada&amp;nbsp;95 added support for [[object-oriented programming]], including [[dynamic dispatch]].

The syntax of Ada is simple, consistent and readable. It minimizes choices of ways to perform basic operations, and prefers English keywords (e.g. &quot;or else&quot;) to symbols (e.g. &quot;||&quot;). Ada uses the basic mathematical symbols (i.e.: &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;*&quot; and &quot;/&quot;) for basic mathematical operations but avoids using other symbols. Code blocks are delimited by words such as &quot;declare&quot;, &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot;, whereas the &quot;end&quot; (in most cases) is followed by the identifier of the block it closes (e.g. ''if.. end if'', ''loop ... end loop''). In the case of conditional blocks this avoids a ''[[dangling else]]'' that could pair with the wrong nested if-expression in other languages.

Ada is designed for development of very large software systems. Ada packages can be compiled separately, and furthermore, Ada package specifications (the package interface) can be compiled separately without the implementation to check for consistency - this makes it possible to detect problems early during the design phase, before implementation starts. 

A large number of compile-time checks are supported to help avoid bugs that would not be detectable until run-time in some other languages or would require explicit checks to be added to the source code.  For example, the syntax requires explicitly named closing of blocks to prevent errors due to mismatched end tokens. The adherence to strong typing allows detection of many common software errors (wrong parameters, range violations, invalid references, mismatched types, etc.) either during compile-time, or otherwise during run-time. As concurrency is part of the language specification, the compiler can in some cases detect potential deadlocks. Compilers also commonly check for misspelled identifiers, visibility of packages, redundant declarations, etc. and can provide warnings and useful suggestions on how to fix the error.

Ada also supports run-time checks to protect against access to unallocated memory, [[buffer overflow]] errors, range violations, [[off-by-one error]]s, array access errors, and other detectable bugs. These checks can be disabled in the interest of runtime efficiency, but can often be compiled efficiently. It also includes facilities to help program verification. For these reasons, Ada is widely used in critical systems, where any [[anomaly in software|anomaly]] might lead to very serious consequences, e.g., accidental death, injury or severe financial loss. Examples of systems where Ada is used include [[avionics]], railways, banking, military and space technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ada helps churn out less-buggy code|url=http://gcn.com/Articles/1999/06/30/Ada-helps-churn-out-lessbuggy-code.aspx|publisher=Government Computer News|accessdate=2010-09-14|author=S.

Ada's dynamic [[memory management]] is high-level and type-safe.  Ada does not have generic (and vague) &quot;pointers&quot;; nor does it implicitly declare any pointer type.  Instead, all dynamic memory allocation and deallocation must take place through explicitly declared ''access types''.
Each access type has an associated ''storage pool'' that handles the low-level details of memory management; the programmer can either use the default storage pool or define new ones (this is particularly relevant for [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]]).  It is even possible to declare several different access types that all designate the same type but use different storage pools.
Also, the language provides for ''accessibility checks'', both at compile time and at run time, that ensures that an ''access value'' cannot outlive the type of the object it points to.

Though the semantics of the language allow automatic [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] of inaccessible objects, most implementations do not support it by default, as it would cause unpredictable behaviour in real-time systems.  Ada does support a limited form of [[region-based storage management]]; also, creative use of storage pools can provide for a limited form of automatic garbage collection, since destroying a storage pool also destroys all the objects in the pool.

Ada was designed to use the English language standard for [[Comment (computer programming)|comments]]: the [[em-dash]], as a double-[[dash]] (&quot;--&quot;) to denote comment text.  Comments stop at end of line, so there is no danger of unclosed comments accidentally voiding whole sections of source code.  Comments can be nested: prefixing each line (or column) with &quot;--&quot; will skip all that code, while being clearly denoted as a column of repeated &quot;--&quot; down the page. There is no limit to the nesting of comments, thereby allowing prior code, with commented-out sections, to be commented-out as even larger sections.  All [[Unicode]] characters are allowed in comments, such as for symbolic formulas (E[0]=m×c²). To the compiler, the double-dash is treated as end-of-line, allowing continued parsing of the language as a [[context-free grammar]].

The semicolon (&quot;;&quot;) is a statement terminator, and the null or no-operation statement is &lt;code&gt;null;&lt;/code&gt;. A single &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; without a statement to terminate is not allowed. This allows for a better quality of error messages.

Code for complex systems is typically maintained for many years, by programmers other than the original author. It can be argued that these language design principles apply to most software projects, and most phases of software development, but when applied to complex, safety critical projects, benefits in correctness, reliability, and maintainability take precedence over (arguable) costs in initial development.

Unlike most [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards, the Ada language definition (known as the ''Ada Reference Manual'' or ''ARM'', or sometimes the ''Language Reference Manual'' or ''LRM'') is [[free content]]. Thus, it is a common reference for Ada programmers and not just programmers implementing Ada compilers. Apart from the reference manual, there is also an extensive rationale document which explains the language design and the use of various language constructs. This document is also widely used by programmers. When the language was revised, a new rationale document was written.

One notable [[free software]] tool that is used by many Ada programmers to aid them in writing Ada source code is '''GPS''', the [[GNAT Programming Studio]].

== History ==
In the 1970s, the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] (DoD) was concerned by the number of different programming languages being used for its embedded computer system projects, many of which were obsolete or hardware-dependent, and none of which supported safe modular programming. In 1975, the [[High Order Language Working Group]] (HOLWG) was formed with the intent to reduce this number by finding or creating a programming language generally suitable for the department's requirements. The result was Ada. The total number of high-level programming languages in use for such projects fell from over 450 in 1983 to 37 by 1996.

{{Wikisource|Steelman language requirements}} The [[working group]] created a series of language requirements documents&amp;mdash;the Strawman, Woodenman, Tinman, Ironman and [[Steelman language requirements|Steelman]] documents. Many existing languages were formally reviewed, but the team concluded in 1977 that no existing language met the specifications.

Requests for proposals for a new programming language were issued and four contractors were hired to develop their proposals under the names of Red ([[Intermetrics]] led by [[Benjamin Brosgol]]), Green ([[CII Honeywell Bull]], led by [[Jean Ichbiah]]), Blue ([[SofTech]], led by [http://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/people/jbg.cfm John Goodenough]), and Yellow ([[SRI International]], led by [[Jay Spitzen]]).&lt;!-- Though Intermetrics and Bull have previous links, I am including them for parallelism. --&gt; In April 1978, after public scrutiny, the Red and Green proposals passed to the next phase. In May 1979, the Green proposal, designed by Jean Ichbiah at CII Honeywell Bull, was chosen and given the name Ada&amp;mdash;after [[Ada Lovelace|Augusta Ada, Countess of Lovelace]]. This proposal was influenced by the programming language [[LIS programming language|LIS]] that Ichbiah and his group had developed in the 1970s. The preliminary Ada reference manual
was published in ACM SIGPLAN Notices in June 1979. The Military Standard reference manual was approved on December 10, 1980 ([[Ada Lovelace]]'s birthday), and
given the number MIL-STD-1815 in honor of Ada Lovelace's birth year. In 1981, [[C. A. R. Hoare]] took advantage of his [[Turing Award]] speech to criticize Ada for being overly complex and hence unreliable,&lt;ref&gt;C.A.R. Hoare, &quot;[http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ravenben/papers/coreos/Hoa81.pdf The Emperor's Old Clothes].&quot; Communications of the ACM, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently seemed to recant in the foreword he wrote for an Ada textbook.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Watt, B.A. Wichmann and W. Findlay, &quot;Ada: Language and Methodology.&quot; Prentice-Hall, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ada attracted much attention from the programming community as a whole during its early days.  Its backers and others predicted that it might become a dominant language for general purpose programming and not just defense-related work.  Ichbiah publicly stated that within ten years, only two programming languages would remain, Ada and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]].&lt;ref name=SIGAda-Rosen&gt;J-P. Rosen, &quot;The Ada Paradox(es)&quot;, ''Ada Letters'', ACM SIGAda, Vol. 24, No. 2, August 2009, pp. 28-35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Ada compilers struggled to implement the large, complex language, and both compile-time and run-time performance tended to be slow and tools primitive.  Compiler vendors expended most of their efforts in passing the massive, language-conformance-testing, government-required &quot;ACVC&quot; validation suite that was required in another novel feature of the Ada language effort.&lt;ref name=SIGAda-Rosen/&gt;

The first validated Ada implementation was the NYU Ada/ED translator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA136759 |title=Ada Compiler Validation Summary Report: NYU Ada/ED, Version 19.7 V-001 |author=SofTech Inc., Waltham, MA |date=1983-04-11 |accessdate=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; certified on April 11, 1983. NYU Ada/ED was implemented in the high-level set language [[SETL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The NYU Ada Translator and Interpreter |first1=Robert B. K. |last1=Dewar |first2=Gerald A. |last2=Fisher Jr. |first3=Edmond |last3=Schonberg |first4=Robert |last4=Froelich |first5=Stephen |last5=Bryant |first6=Clinton F. |last6=Goss |first7=Michael |last7=Burke |journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices - Proceedings of the ACM-SIGPLAN Symposium on the Ada Programming Language |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=194–201 |year=1980 |month=November |isbn=0-89791-030-3 |doi=10.1145/948632.948659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ada Lovelace 1838.jpg|right|caption|thumbnail|157px|[[Ada Lovelace|Augusta Ada King]], Countess of Lovelace.]]
In 1987, the US Department of Defense began to require the use of Ada (the ''[[Ada mandate]]'') for every software project where new code was more than 30% of result, though exceptions to this rule were often granted.

By the late 1980s and early 1990s, Ada compilers had improved in performance, but there were still barriers to full exploitation of Ada's abilities, including a tasking model that was different from what most real-time programmers were used to.&lt;ref name=SIGAda-Rosen/&gt;

The Department of Defense Ada mandate was effectively removed in 1997, as the DoD began to embrace COTS ([[commercial off-the-shelf]]) technology. Similar requirements existed in other [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]] countries.

Because of Ada's safety-critical support features, it is now used not only for military applications, but also in commercial projects where a software bug can have severe consequences, e.g. aviation and [[air traffic control]], commercial rockets (e.g. Ariane 4 and 5), [[satellite]]s and other space systems, railway transport and banking.&lt;ref name=Ada_usage /&gt; 
For example, the [[Aircraft flight control systems|fly-by-wire]] system software in the [[Boeing 777]] was written in Ada. The Canadian Automated Air Traffic System was written in 1 million lines of Ada ([[Source lines of code|SLOC]] count). It featured advanced distributed processing, a distributed Ada database, and object-oriented design. Ada is also used in other air traffic systems, e.g. the UK’s next-generation Interim Future Area Control Tools Support (iFACTS) air traffic control system is designed and implemented using SPARK Ada &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AdaCore|title=GNAT Pro Chosen for UK’s Next Generation ATC System|url=http://www.adacore.com/2007/06/19/adacore-gnat-pro-chosen-for-uk-next-generation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is also used in the [[France|French]] [[Transmission Voie-Machine|TVM]] in-[[cab signalling]] system on the [[TGV]] high speed rail system, and the metro suburban trains in Paris, London, Hong Kong and New York City.&lt;ref name=Ada_usage /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AdaCore|title=Look Who’s Using Ada|url=http://www.adacore.com/home/ada_answers/lookwho/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standardization ==
The language became an [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard in 1983 ([http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/Welcome.html ANSI/MIL-STD 1815A]), and without any further changes became
an [[International standard|ISO standard]] in 1987 (ISO-8652:1987). This version of the language is commonly known as Ada&amp;nbsp;83, from the date of its adoption by ANSI, but is sometimes referred to also as Ada&amp;nbsp;87, from the date of its adoption by ISO.

Ada&amp;nbsp;95, the joint ISO/ANSI standard ([http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-TTL.html ISO-8652:1995]) was published in February 1995, making Ada&amp;nbsp;95 the first ISO standard object-oriented programming language. To help with the standard revision and future acceptance, the [[US Air Force]] funded the development of the [[GNAT]] [[Compiler]]. Presently, the GNAT Compiler is part of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]].

Work has continued on improving and updating the technical content of the Ada programming language. A Technical Corrigendum to Ada&amp;nbsp;95 was published in October 2001, and a major Amendment, [http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=45001 ISO/IEC 8652:1995/Amd 1:2007], the current version of the standard, was published on March 9, 2007. Work on the next significant Ada Amendment is planned to be completed by 2012.([http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/12rm/html/RM-TTL.html ISO/IEC 8652:201z Ed. 3])

Other related standards include [[ISO]] 8651-3:1988 ''Information processing systems—Computer graphics—Graphical Kernel System (GKS) language bindings—Part 3: Ada''.

== Language constructs ==

Ada is an [[ALGOL]]-like programming language featuring control structures with reserved words such as '''if''', '''then''', '''else''', '''while''', '''for''', and so on. However, Ada also has many data structuring facilities and other abstractions which were not included in the original [[ALGOL 60]], such as [[type system|type definitions]], [[record (computer science)|record]]s, [[pointer (computing)|pointer]]s, [[enumerated type|enumeration]]s. Such constructs were in part inherited or inspired from [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].

=== &quot;Hello, world!&quot; in Ada ===

A common example of a language's [[Syntax_(programming_languages)|syntax]] is the [[Hello world program]]: (A more in-depth example can be [http://knol.google.com/k/optimus/learning-the-ada-programming-language/3qj2q07til2m7/1 found here])
(hello.adb)
&lt;source lang=&quot;ada&quot;&gt;
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
procedure Hello is
begin
  Put_Line(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
end Hello;
&lt;/source&gt;
This program can be compiled e.g. by using the freely available open source compiler GNAT, by executing
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;gnatmake hello.adb&lt;/source&gt;

=== Data types ===

Ada's type system is not based on a set of predefined [[primitive types]] but allows users to declare their own types. This declaration in turn is not based on the internal representation of the type but on describing the goal which should be achieved. This allows the compiler to determine a suitable memory size for the type, and to check for violations of the type definition at compile time and run time (i.e. range violations, buffer overruns, type consistency, etc.). Ada supports numerical types defined by a range, modulo types, aggregate types (records and arrays), and enumeration types. Access types define a reference to an instance of a specified type; untyped pointers are not permitted.
Special types provided by the language are task types and protected types. 

For example a date might be represented as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ada&quot;&gt;
type Day_type   is range    1 ..   31;
type Month_type is range    1 ..   12;
type Year_type  is range 1800 .. 2100;
type Hours is mod 24;
type Weekday is (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday); 

type Date is
   record
     Day   : Day_type;
     Month : Month_type;
     Year  : Year_type;
   end record; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Types can have modifiers such as ''limited, abstract, private'' etc. Private types can only be accessed and limited types can only be modified or copied within the scope of the package that defines them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ada Syntax Card|url=http://www.digilife.be/quickreferences/QRC/Ada%20Syntax%20Card.pdf|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ada 95 adds additional features for object-oriented extension of types.

===Control structures===

Ada is a [[structured programming]] language, meaning that the flow of control is structured into standard statements. All standard constructs and deep level early exit are supported so the use of the also supported '[[goto (command)|go to]]' commands is seldom needed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ada&quot;&gt;
while a /= b loop
  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Waiting&quot;);
end loop;

if a &gt; b then
  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Condition met&quot;);
else
  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Condition not met&quot;);
end if;

for i in 1 .. 10 loop
  Ada.Text_IO.Put (&quot;Iteration: &quot;);
  Ada.Text_IO.Put (i);
  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line;
end loop;

loop
  a := a + 1;
  exit when a = 10;
end loop;

case i is
  when 0 =&gt; Ada.Text_IO.Put(&quot;zero&quot;);
  when 1 =&gt; Ada.Text_IO.Put(&quot;one&quot;);
  when 2 =&gt; Ada.Text_IO.Put(&quot;two&quot;);
  -- case statements have to cover all possible cases:
  when others =&gt; Ada.Text_IO.Put(&quot;none of the above&quot;);  
end case;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Packages, procedures and functions ===

Ada programs consist of packages, procedures and functions.

Example: 
Package specification (example.ads)
&lt;source lang=&quot;ada&quot;&gt;
Package Example is
     type Number is range 1 .. 11;
     procedure Print_and_Increment (j: in out Number);
end Example;
&lt;/source&gt;
Package implementation (example.adb)
&lt;source lang=&quot;ada&quot;&gt;
with Ada.Text_IO; 
Package body Example is

  i : Number := Number'First;
   
  procedure Print_and_Increment (j: in out Number) is
  
    function Next (k: in Number) return Number is
    begin
      return k + 1;
    end Next;
  
  begin
    Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ('The total is: ' &amp; Number'Image(j));
    j := Next (j);
  end Print_and_Increment;
  
begin
  while i &lt; Number'Last loop
    Print_and_Increment (i);
  end loop;
end Example;
&lt;/source&gt;

Packages, Procedures and functions can nest to any depth and each can also be the logical outermost block.

Each package, procedure or function can have its own declarations of constants, types, variables, and other procedures, functions and packages, which can be declared in any order.

=== Concurrency ===
Ada has language support for task-based concurrency. The fundamental concurrent unit in Ada is a ''task'' which is a built-in limited type. Tasks are specified in two parts - the task declaration defines the task interface (similar to a type declaration), the task body specifies the implementation of the task.
Depending on the implementation, Ada tasks are either mapped to operating system tasks or processes, or are scheduled internally by the Ada runtime.

Tasks can have entries for synchronisation (a form of [[message passing|synchronous message passing]]). Task entries are declared in the task specification. Each task entry can have one or more ''accept'' statements within the task body. If the control flow of the task reaches an accept statement, the task is blocked until the corresponding entry is called by another task (similarly, a calling task is blocked until the called task reaches the corresponding accept statement). Task entries can have parameters similar to procedures, allowing tasks to synchronously exchange data. In conjunction with ''select'' statements it is possible to define ''guards'' on accept statements (similar to Dijkstra's [[guarded commands]]).

Ada also offers [[protected object|''protected objects'']] for [[mutual exclusion]]. Protected objects are a [[Monitor (synchronization)|monitor-like]] construct, but use guards  instead of conditional variables for signaling (similar to conditional critical regions). Protected objects combine the data encapsulation and safe mutual exclusion from monitors, and entry guards from conditional critical regions.  The main advantage over classical monitors is that conditional variables are not required for signaling, avoiding potential deadlocks due to incorrect locking semantics. Like tasks, the protected object is a built-in limited type, and it also has a declaration part and a body. 

A protected object consists of encapsulated private data (which can only be accessed from within the protected object), and procedures, functions and entries which are guaranteed to be mutually exclusive (with the only exception of functions, which are required to be side effect free and can therefore run concurrently with other functions). A task calling a protected object is blocked if another task is currently executing inside the same protected object, and released when this other task leaves the protected object. Blocked tasks are queued on the protected object ordered by time of arrival.

Protected object entries are similar to procedures, but additionally have ''guards''. If a guard evaluates to false, a calling task is blocked and added to the queue of that entry; now another task can be admitted to the protected object, as no task is currently executing inside the protected object. Guards are re-evaluated whenever a task leaves the protected object, as this is the only time when the evaluation of guards can have changed. 

Calls to entries can be ''requeued'' to other entries with the same signature. A task that is requeued is blocked and added to the queue of the target entry; this means that the protected object is released and allows admission of another task.  

The ''select'' statement in Ada can be used to implement non-blocking entry calls and accepts, non-deterministic selection of entries (also with guards), time-outs and aborts. 

The following example illustrates some concepts of concurrent programming in Ada.

A pragma is a compiler directive that convey information to the compiler to allow specific manipulation of compiled output.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ada '83 Language Reference Manual&quot;&gt;United States Government. [http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-02-08.html#2.8] Retrieved April 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain pragmas are built in to the language&lt;ref name=&quot;Ada '83 Language Reference Manual Appendix B&quot;&gt;United States Government. [http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-B.html] Retrieved April 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; while other are implementation-specific.

Examples of common usage of compiler pragmas would be to disable certain features, such as run-time type checking or array subscript boundary checking, or to instruct the compiler to insert object code in lieu of a function call (as C/C++ does with inline functions).

'''Alfonso Arau''' (born January 11, 1932) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] actor and director.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb name|id=0000778|name=Alfonso Arau}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Arau was born in [[Mexico City]], the son of a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/27/Alfonso-Arau.html Alfonso Arau]. Film Reference, Biography, 2007.  Last accessed: April 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He directed the films ''[[Zapata: The Dream of a Hero]]'', ''[[Like Water for Chocolate (film)|Like Water for Chocolate]]'' (adapted from [[Like Water for Chocolate|the novel]] written by his ex-wife [[Laura Esquivel]]), ''[[A Walk in the Clouds]]'' with [[Keanu Reeves]] and [[Anthony Quinn]], and the ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'' production ''[[A Painted House]]'', adapted from the [[John Grisham]] novel of the same name. Among many roles in his career, Arau has played &quot;Captain Herrera&quot;, a lieutenant of Federale general &quot;Mapache&quot;, in [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s 1969 western, ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'',  chief bandit &quot;El Guapo&quot; in ''[[Three Amigos]]'' (USA, 1986), a comedy with [[Martin Short]], [[Steve Martin]], and [[Chevy Chase]], and the smuggler &quot;Juan&quot; in ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' which starred [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Kathleen Turner]]. Arau appeared in the 1972 Mexican film ''El rincón de las vírgenes'' (&quot;The Virgins' Corner&quot;), where he played the assistant of a fake mystical doctor traveling from town to town, who reminisce about their travels, when a group of women decide to propose the doctor for sainthood. The movie was set in 1920s rural Mexico.

Arau has made many appearances as a character actor in American and TV series and plays. In the 1972 episode of ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' titled &quot;Hidalgo&quot;, Arau portrayed the bandit &quot;Mando&quot; who shoots and wounds [[United States Marshals Service|marshal]] &quot;[[Marshal Matt Dillon|Matt Dillon]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0594144/ TV Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1973 in film|1973]], Arau acted in and directed ''Calzónzin Inspector'' (&quot;Cazonci&quot; or &quot;Caltzontzin&quot; was the term used in the Purépecha culture, to name their emperors.), a movie based on a character from  the Mexican comic ''Los Supermachos'' of Mexican cartoonist [[Rius]], who co-wrote the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069836/fullcredits#cast ''Calzónzin Inspector''] at IMDB.com&lt;/ref&gt; The movie is about two Mexicans who are mistakenly taken for government inspectors from the capital by the corrupt mayor of a small town. It is a humorous political critique, aimed squarely at the then ruling party [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] (PRI) and its [[paramilitary]] ''[[Cacique Nutibara Bloc|cacique]]s'', at a time when freedom of speech in politics was highly restricted.  There are at least two versions of the movie, with one having some scenes deleted, the most notable of which depicts the killing of a renegade farmer by a police officer, who shoots the farmer in the back.

In December 2004, the [[Santa Fe Film Festival]] honored Alfonso Arau for his work in cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2004/12/06/daily21.html New Mexico Business Weekly] Dec. 10, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, he starred in [[Chad, Matt &amp; Rob]]'s &quot;The Treasure Hunt: An Interactive Adventure.&quot;

'''Alfonso Cuarón Orozco''' ({{IPA-es|alˈfonso kwaˈɾon}}; born 28 November 1961) is a Mexican [[film director]], [[screenwriter]] and [[film producer]], best known for his films ''[[Children of Men]]'', [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], ''[[Y tu mamá también]]'', and [[A Little Princess (1995 film)|''A Little Princess'']].

== Early life ==
Alfonso Cuarón was born in [[México City]] and is the son of Alfredo Cuarón, a nuclear physicist who worked for the United Nations' [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] for many years. 

Cuarón studied Philosophy at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) and filmmaking at CUEC ([[Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos]]), a faculty of the same University. There, he met director Carlos Marcovich and [[cinematographer]] [[Emmanuel Lubezki]], and they made what would be his first [[short film]], ''Vengeance is mine''. The controversy caused by the fact that the film was shot in English was the reason he was expelled from the [[film school]].

== Career ==
Cuarón began working in television in Mexico, first as a technician and then as a director. His television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several Latin American film productions including ''[[Gaby: A True Story]]'' and ''[[Romero (film)|Romero]]'', and in 1991, he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment.

=== ''Sólo con tu pareja'' ===
''[[Sólo con tu pareja]]'' was a sex comedy about a womanizing businessman (played by [[Daniel Giménez Cacho]]), who after spurning an attractive nurse, is fooled into believing he's contracted [[HIV]]. In addition to writing, producing, and directing, Cuarón co-edited the film with Luis Patlán. It is somewhat unusual for directors to be credited co-editors, although the [[Coen Brothers]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]] have both directed and edited nearly all of their films. Cuarón continued this close involvement in editing on several of his later films.

The film, which also starred cabaret singer [[Astrid Hadad]] and model/actress Claudia Ramírez — with whom Cuarón was linked between 1989 and 1993 — was a big hit in Mexico. After this success, director [[Sydney Pollack]] hired Cuarón to direct an episode of ''[[Fallen Angels (TV series)|Fallen Angels]]'', a series of neo-noir stories produced for the Showtime premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included [[Steven Soderbergh]], [[Jonathan Kaplan]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], and [[Tom Hanks]].

=== International success ===
In 1995, Cuarón released his first feature film produced in the United States, ''[[A Little Princess (1995 film)|A Little Princess]]'', an adaptation of [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s classic novel. Cuarón's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Great Expectations (1998 film)|Great Expectations]]'' starring [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], and [[Robert De Niro]].

Cuarón's next project found him returning to Mexico with a Spanish-speaking cast to film ''[[Y tu mamá también]]'', starring [[Gael García Bernal]] and [[Diego Luna]].  It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman in her late twenties. The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics.  Cuarón shared an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Original Screenplay with co-writer and brother [[Carlos Cuarón]].
[[File:Cuaronhp3.JPG|thumb|right|190px|Cuarón on the set of ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]''.]]
In 2003, Cuarón directed the third film in the successful ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. Cuarón faced criticism from some of the more purist ''Potter'' fans for his approach to the film. At the time of the movie's release, however, author [[J. K. Rowling]] said that it was her personal favorite from the series so far.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=76 J.K. Rowling] Accessed 17 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Critically, the film was also better received than the first two instalments, with some critics remarking that it was the first ''Potter'' film to truly capture the essence of the novels. During the middle of the film, Cuarón can be seen making a [[cameo appearance]] as a wizard in ''[[The Three Broomsticks]]''.

Cuarón's feature, ''[[Children of Men]]'', an adaptation of the [[P. D. James]] novel starring [[Clive Owen]], [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Michael Caine]], received wide critical acclaim, including three [[Academy Award]] nominations. Cuarón himself received two nominations for his work on the film in both Editing (with [[Alex Rodríguez (film editor)|Alex Rodríguez]]) and Adapted Screenplay (with several collaborators).

He created the production and distribution company [[Esperanto Films]], which has credits on the films ''[[Duck Season]]'' and ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''.

Cuarón also directed the controversial public service announcement &quot;I Am Autism&quot; for [[Autism Speaks]] that was sharply criticized by disability rights groups for its negative portrayal of autism.&lt;ref&gt;http://asansouthwestohio.blogspot.com/2009/09/autistic-community-condemns-autism.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Cuarón began to develop a science fiction film named ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]'', which he is set to direct. He is joined by his old ''Potter'' colleague [[David Heyman]], who will produce the film.

{{Arianism}}
'''Arianism''' is the theological teaching attributed to [[Arius]] ([[circa|ca.]] AD 250–336), a Christian [[presbyter]] from [[Alexandria]], Egypt, concerning the relationship of the entities of the [[Trinity]] ('God the Father', 'God the Son' and 'God the Holy Spirit') and the precise nature of the [[Son of God]] as being a subordinate entity to God the Father. Deemed a [[heresy|heretic]] by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] of 325, Arius was later exonerated in 335 at the [[First Synod of Tyre]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Socrates of Constantinople]], ''Church History'', book 1, chapter 33.  Anthony F. Beavers, ''Chronology of the Arian Controversy''.&lt;/ref&gt; and then, after his death, pronounced a heretic again at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] of 381.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.ix.viii.i.html |title=First Council of Constantinople, Canon 1 |publisher=ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Emperors [[Constantius II#Christianity under Constantius|Constantius II]] (337–361) and [[Valens#Struggles with the religious nature of the empire|Valens]] (364–378) were Arians or [[Semi-Arianism|Semi-Arians]]. The Arian [[Christology|concept of Christ]] is that the Son of God did not always exist, but was created by—and is therefore distinct from and inferior to—God the Father. This belief is grounded in the [[Gospel of John]] passage “You heard me say, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.&quot; (verse {{bibleverse-nb||John|14:28}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Williams | first = Rowan | authorlink = Rowan Williams | title = Arius: heresy and tradition | publisher = Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co | year = 2002 | pages = 98 | isbn = 978-0-8028-4969-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arianism is defined as those teachings attributed to Arius which are in opposition to mainstream Trinitarian Christological doctrine, as determined by the first two [[Ecumenical Council]]s and currently maintained by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] and most [[Reformation]] [[Protestant]] Churches.  &quot;Arianism&quot; is also often used to refer to other [[nontrinitarian]] theological systems of the 4th century, which regarded [[Jesus Christ]]—the Son of God, the [[Logos]]—as either a created being (as in Arianism proper and [[Anomoeanism]]), or as neither uncreated nor created in the sense other beings are created (as in [[Semi-Arianism]]).

==Origin==
{{Main|Arius|Arian controversy}}
Arius taught that God the Father and [[Christian views of Jesus|the Son]] did not exist together eternally. He taught that the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|pre-incarnate]] Jesus was a divine being created by (and therefore inferior to) God the Father at some point, before which the Son did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;M'Clintock and Strong's Cyclopedia, Volume 7, page 45a.&lt;/ref&gt; In English-language works, it is sometimes said that Arians believe that Jesus is or was a &quot;creature&quot;, in the sense of &quot;created being&quot;. Arius and his followers appealed to Bible verses such as where Jesus says that the father is &quot;greater than I&quot; ([[Gospel of John|John]] {{bibleverse-nb||John|14:28}}), and says &quot;The Lord created me at the beginning of his work&quot; ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] {{bibleverse-nb||Proverbs|8:22}})&lt;ref name=&quot;FiorenzaGalvin1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Francis Schüssler Fiorenza|author2=John P. Galvin|title=Systematic theology: Roman Catholic perspectives|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=btI0eD3aNvoC&amp;pg=PA164|accessdate=14 April 2010|year=1991|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=9780800624606|pages=164–}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this verse is now generally held to refer to some concept of &quot;wisdom&quot; rather than to the Son of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Pro&amp;chapter=8&amp;mode=print | accessdate = 13 April 2010 | title=NET Bible: Proverbs 8:22; study note 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the various disagreements within the Christian Church, the Arian controversy has held the greatest force and power of theological and political conflict, with the possible exception of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The conflict between Arianism and [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] beliefs was the first major doctrinal confrontation in the Church after the legalization of Christianity by the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/lactant/lactperf.html | accessdate = 26 June 2010 | title=Of the Manner in Which the Persecutors Died - Chap. XLVIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy over Arianism began to rise in the late 3rd century and extended over the greater part of the 4th century and involved most church members, simple believers, priests and monks as well as bishops, emperors and members of Rome's imperial family. Yet, such a deep controversy within the Church could not have materialized in the 3rd and 4th centuries without some significant historical influences providing the basis for the Arian doctrines. Many historians define and minimize the Arian conflict as the exclusive construct of Arius and a handful of rogue bishops engaging in [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. Of the roughly three hundred bishops in attendance at the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], only three bishops did not sign the [[Nicene Creed]].  However, to minimize the extent of Arianism ignores the fact that extremely prominent Emperors such as [[Constantius II]],  and [[Valens]] were Arians, as well as prominent [[Goths|Gothic]], [[Vandal]] and [[Lombards|Lombard]] warlords both before and after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and that none of these groups was out of the mainstream of the Roman Empire in the 4th century.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

After the dispute over Arius politicized, and a general solution to the debate was sought – with a great majority holding to the Trinitarian position – the Arian position was officially declared to be [[heterodox]]. [[Lucian of Antioch]] had contended for a christology very similar to what would later be known as Arianism and is thought to have contributed much to its development. Arius was a student of [[School of Antioch|Lucian's private academy in Antioch]].

While Arianism continued to dominate for several decades even within the family of the Emperor, the Imperial nobility, and higher-ranking clergy, in the end it was Trinitarianism which prevailed in the Roman Empire at the end of the 4th century. Arianism, which had been taught by the Arian missionary [[Ulfilas]] to the Germanic tribes, was dominant for some centuries among several Germanic tribes in western Europe, especially [[Goths]] and [[Lombards]] (and significantly for the late Empire, the [[Vandals]]), but ceased to be the mainstream belief by the 8th century. Trinitarianism remained the dominant doctrine in all major branches of the Eastern and Western Church and later within [[Protestantism]].

==Beliefs==
Because most extant written material on Arianism was written by its opponents, the nature of Arian teachings is difficult to define precisely today. The letter of [[Auxentius of Durostorum|Auxentius]],&lt;ref&gt;The letter can be found at {{cite web |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/auxentius.trans.html |title=? |publisher=ccat.sas.upenn.edu }}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 4th-century Arian [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|bishop of Milan]], regarding the missionary [[Ulfilas]], gives the clearest picture of Arian beliefs on the nature of the Trinity: [[God]] the Father (&quot;unbegotten&quot;), always existing, was separate from the lesser Jesus Christ (&quot;only-begotten&quot;), born before time began and creator of the world. The Father, working through the Son, created the Holy Spirit, who was subservient to the Son as the Son was to the Father. The Father was seen as &quot;the only true God&quot;. [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|First Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb||Corinthians|8:5}}-{{bibleverse-nb||Corinthians|8:6}} was cited as [[proof text]]:

{{quote|Indeed, even though there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth — as in fact there are many gods and many lords — yet for us there is one God (Gk. ''theos'' - θεος), the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord (''kyrios'' - κυριος), Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.|[[NRSV]]}}

A letter from Arius to the Arian [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]] succinctly states the core beliefs of the Arians:

{{quote|Some of them say that the Son is an eructation, others that he is a production, others that he is also unbegotten. These are impieties to which we cannot listen, even though the heretics threaten us with a thousand deaths. But we say and believe and have taught, and do teach, that the Son is not unbegotten, nor in any way part of the unbegotten; and that he does not derive his subsistence from any matter; but that by his own will and counsel he has subsisted before time and before ages as perfect God, only begotten and unchangeable, and that before he was begotten, or created, or purposed, or established, he was not. For he was not unbegotten. We are persecuted, because we say that the Son has a beginning, but that God is without beginning.|Peters|''Heresy and Authority in [[Medieval Europe]]'', p. 41}}

==First Council of Nicaea and its aftermath==

[[Image:Miniature Council of Nicaea condemned Arius (Century IV) sz200.jpg|200px|thumb|A 4th-century miniature of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], which condemned [[Arius]]'s teaching]]
In 321, Arius was denounced by a [[synod]] at Alexandria for teaching a heterodox view of the relationship of Jesus to God the Father. Because Arius and his followers had great influence in the schools of Alexandria—counterparts to modern universities or seminaries—their theological views spread, especially in the eastern Mediterranean.

By 325, the controversy had become significant enough that the [[Emperor Constantine]] called an assembly of bishops, the [[First Council of Nicaea]], which condemned Arius' doctrine and formulated the original [[Nicene Creed#The original Nicene Creed of 325|Nicene Creed of 325]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.vii.iii.html NPNF2-14. |title=The Seven Ecumenical Councils |publisher= Christian Classics Ethereal Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nicene Creed's central term, used to describe the relationship between the Father and the Son, is [[Homoousios]], or [[Consubstantiality]], meaning &quot;of the same substance&quot; or &quot;of one being&quot;. (The [[Athanasian Creed]] is less often used but is a more overtly anti-Arian statement on the Trinity.)

The focus of the Council of Nicaea was the divinity of Christ (see [[Paul of Samosata]] and the [[Synods of Antioch]]). Arius taught that Jesus Christ was divine and was sent to earth for the salvation of mankind but that Jesus Christ was not equal to the Father (infinite, primordial origin) and to the Holy Spirit (giver of life). Under Arianism, Christ was instead not [[consubstantiality|consubstantial]] with God the Father &lt;ref name=Pomazansky&gt;&quot;The oneness of Essence, the Equality of Divinity, and the Equality of Honor of God the Son with the God the Father.&quot; Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pages 92–95&lt;/ref&gt; since both the Father and the Son under Arius were made of &quot;like&quot; essence or being (see [[homoiousia]]) but not of the same essence or being (see [[homoousia]]).&lt;ref name=Pomazansky/&gt; [[Ousia]] is essence or being, in Eastern Christianity, and is the aspect of God that is completely incomprehensible to mankind and human perception. It is all that subsists by itself and which has not its being in another,&lt;ref&gt;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, SVS Press, 1997. (ISBN 0-913836-31-1) James Clarke &amp; Co Ltd, 1991. (ISBN 0-227-67919-9) V Lossky pg50-51&lt;/ref&gt; God the Father and God the Son and God the Holy Spirit all being uncreated.&lt;ref&gt;Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pages 57 As quoted by [[John Damascene]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;God is unoriginate, unending, eternal, constant, uncreated, unchanging, unalterable, simple, incomplex, bodiless, invisible, intangible, indescribable, without bounds, inaccessible to the mind, uncontainable, incomprehensible, good, righteous, that Creator of all creatures, the almighty [[Pantocrator]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to the teaching of Arius, the preexistent Logos and thus the incarnate Jesus Christ was a created being; that only the Son was directly created and begotten by God the Father, before ages, but was of a distinct, though similar, essence or substance from the Creator; his opponents argued that this would make Jesus less than God, and that this was heretical.&lt;ref name=Pomazansky/&gt; Much of the distinction between the differing factions was over the phrasing that Christ expressed in the New Testament to express submission to God the Father.&lt;ref name=Pomazansky/&gt; The theological term for this submission is [[kenosis]]. This Ecumenical council declared that Jesus Christ was a distinct being of God in existence or reality ([[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]), which the Latin fathers translated as persona. Jesus was God in essence, being and or nature ([[ousia]]), which the Latin fathers translated as substantia.
[[File:Constantine burning Arian books.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] burning Arian books, illustration from a compendium of [[canon law, ca. 825]]]]
Constantine is believed to have exiled those who refused to accept the Nicean creed—Arius himself, the deacon [[Euzoios]], and the Libyan bishops [[Theonas of Marmarica]] and [[Secundus of Ptolemais]]—and also the bishops who signed the creed but refused to join in condemnation of Arius, Eusebius of Nicomedia and [[Theognis of Nicaea]]. The Emperor also ordered all copies of the ''Thalia'', the book in which Arius had expressed his teachings, to be [[Book burning|burned]].  However, there is no evidence that his son and ultimate successor, [[Constantius II]], who was an Arian Christian, was exiled.

Although he was committed to maintaining what the church had defined at Nicaea, Constantine was also bent on pacifying the situation and eventually became more lenient toward those condemned and exiled at the council. First he allowed Eusebius of Nicomedia, who was a protégé of his sister, and Theognis to return once they had signed an ambiguous statement of faith. The two, and other friends of Arius, worked for Arius' rehabilitation. At the [[First Synod of Tyre]] in AD 335, they brought accusations against [[Pope Athanasius I of Alexandria|Athanasius]], bishop of Alexandria, the primary opponent of Arius; after this, Constantine had Athanasius banished, since he considered him an impediment to reconciliation. In the same year, the Synod of Jerusalem under Constantine's direction readmitted [[Arius]] to communion in AD 336. [[Arius]], however, died on the way to this event in Constantinople.  Some scholars suggest that Arius may have been poisoned by his opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbons &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, Chapter 21, (1776-88), Jonathan Kirsch, &quot;God Against the Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism&quot;, 2004, and Charles Freeman, &quot;The Closing of the Western Mind: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason&quot;, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eusebius and Theognis remained in the Emperor's favour, and when Constantine, who had been a [[catechumen]] much of his adult life, accepted [[baptism]] on his deathbed, it was from Eusebius of Nicomedia.

==Theological debates==
[[File:PalatiumTheodoricMosaicDetail.jpg|thumb|Once the Orthodox Trinitarians succeeded in defeating Arianism, they censored any signs that the perceived heresy left behind. This mosaic in [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]] in Ravenna has had images of the Arian king, Theoderic, and his court removed. However, on some columns their hands remain.]]
The Council of Nicaea did not end the controversy, as many bishops of the Eastern provinces disputed the ''[[homoousios]]'', the central term of the Nicene creed, as it had been used by [[Paul of Samosata]], who had advocated a [[Monarchianism|monarchianist]] [[Christology]]. Both the man and his teaching, including the term ''homoousios'', had been condemned by the [[Synods of Antioch]] in 269.

Hence, after Constantine's death in 337, open dispute resumed again. Constantine's son [[Constantius II]], who had become Emperor of the eastern part of the Empire, actually encouraged the Arians and set out to reverse the Nicene creed. His advisor in these affairs was Eusebius of Nicomedia, who had already at the Council of Nicea been the head of the Arian party, who also was made bishop of Constantinople.

Constantius used his power to exile bishops adhering to the Nicene creed, especially Athanasius of Alexandria, who fled to Rome. In 355 Constantius became the sole Emperor and extended his pro-Arian policy toward the western provinces, frequently using force to push through his creed, even exiling [[Pope Liberius]] and installing [[Antipope Felix II]].

As debates raged in an attempt to come up with a new formula, three camps evolved among the opponents of the Nicene creed. The first group mainly opposed the Nicene terminology and preferred the term ''homoiousios'' (alike in substance) to the Nicene ''homoousios'', while they rejected Arius and his teaching and accepted the equality and coeternality of the persons of the Trinity. Because of this centrist position, and despite their rejection of Arius, they were called &quot;semi-Arians&quot; by their opponents. The second group also avoided invoking the name of Arius, but in large part followed Arius' teachings and, in another attempted compromise wording, described the Son as being like ([[Acacians|''homoios'']]) the Father. A third group explicitly called upon Arius and described the Son as unlike ([[Anomoeanism|''anhomoios'']]) the Father. Constantius wavered in his support between the first and the second party, while harshly persecuting the third.

The debates among these groups resulted in numerous synods, among them the [[Council of Sardica]] in 343, the [[Council of Sirmium]] in 358 and the double [[Council of Rimini]] and Seleucia in 359, and no fewer than fourteen further creed formulas between 340 and 360, leading the pagan observer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] to comment sarcastically: &quot;The highways were covered with galloping bishops.&quot; None of these attempts were acceptable to the defenders of Nicene orthodoxy: writing about the latter councils, Saint [[Jerome]] remarked that the world &quot;awoke with a groan to find itself Arian.&quot;

After Constantius' death in 361, his successor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], a devotee of [[Paganism|Rome's pagan gods]], declared that he would no longer attempt to favor one church faction over another, and allowed all exiled bishops to return; this had the objective of further increasing dissension among Christians. The Emperor [[Valens]], however, revived Constantius' policy and supported the &quot;Homoian&quot; party, exiling bishops and often using force. During this persecution many bishops were exiled to the other ends of the Empire, (e.g., [[Hilary of Poitiers]] to the Eastern provinces). These contacts and the common plight subsequently led to a rapprochement between the Western supporters of the Nicene creed and the ''homoousios'' and the Eastern semi-Arians.

==Theodosius and the Council of Constantinople==
{{Main|Theodosius I}}
It was not until the co-reigns of Gratian and Theodosius that Arianism was effectively wiped out among the ruling class and elite of the Eastern Empire. Theodosius' wife St [[Aelia Flacilla|Flacilla]] was instrumental in his campaign to end Arianism. Valens died in the [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of]] [[Adrianople]] in 378 and was succeeded by [[Theodosius I]], who adhered to the Nicene creed. This allowed for settling the dispute.

Two days after Theodosius arrived in Constantinople, November 24, 380, he expelled the Homoian bishop, [[Demophilus of Constantinople]], and surrendered the churches of that city to [[Gregory Nazianzus]], the leader of the rather small Nicene community there, an act which provoked rioting. Theodosius had just been baptized, by bishop Acholius of Thessalonica, during a severe illness, as was common in the early Christian world. In February he and [[Gratian]] had published an edict&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.iii.xii.iv.html |title=Sozomen's Church History VII.4 |publisher=ccel.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; that all their subjects should profess the faith of the bishops of Rome and Alexandria (i.e., the Nicene faith), or be handed over for punishment for not doing so.

Although much of the church hierarchy in the East had opposed the Nicene creed in the decades leading up to Theodosius' accession, he managed to achieve unity on the basis of the Nicene creed. In 381, at the [[First Council of Constantinople|Second Ecumenical Council]] in Constantinople, a group of mainly Eastern bishops assembled and accepted the [[Nicene Creed#The Niceno–Constantinopolitan Creed of 381|Nicene Creed of 381]],&lt;ref&gt;The text of this version of the [[Nicene creed]] is available at {{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.ix.iii.html |title=The Holy Creed Which the 150 Holy Fathers Set Forth, Which is Consonant with the Holy and Great Synod of Nice |publisher=ccel.org |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was supplemented in regard to the [[Holy Spirit]], as well as some other changes: see [[Nicene Creed#Comparison between Creed of 325 and Creed of 381|Comparison between Creed of 325 and Creed of 381]]. This is generally considered the end of the dispute about the Trinity and the end of Arianism among the Roman, non-Germanic peoples.

==Later debates==
[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] labelled the party of [[Basil of Ancyra]] in 358 &quot;[[Semi-Arianism]]&quot;.

==Early medieval Germanic kingdoms==
{{Main|Gothic Christianity|Germanic Christianity}}
However, during the time of Arianism's flowering in [[Constantinople]], the Gothic convert [[Ulfilas]] (later the subject of the letter of Auxentius cited above) was sent as a missionary to the Gothic barbarians across the [[Danube River|Danube]], a mission favored for political reasons by emperor Constantius II. Ulfilas' initial success in converting this Germanic people to an Arian form of Christianity was strengthened by later events. When the Germanic peoples entered the [[Roman Empire]] and founded successor-kingdoms in the western part, most had been Arian Christians for more than a century.

[[Image:Baptistery.Arians06.jpg|250px|thumb|Ceiling Mosaic of the [[Arian Baptistry]]]]
The conflict in the 4th century had seen Arian and Nicene factions struggling for control of the Church. In contrast, in the Arian German kingdoms established on the wreckage of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, there were entirely separate Arian and Nicene Churches with parallel hierarchies, each serving different sets of believers. The Germanic elites were Arians, and the majority population was Nicene. Many scholars see the persistence of Germanic Arianism as a strategy that was followed in order to differentiate the Germanic elite from the local inhabitants and their culture and also to maintain the Germanic elite's separate group identity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Most Germanic tribes were generally tolerant of the Nicene beliefs of their subjects. However, the Vandals tried for several decades to force their Arian beliefs on their North African Nicene subjects, exiling Nicene clergy, dissolving monasteries, and exercising heavy pressure on non-conforming Christians.

By the beginning of the 8th century, these kingdoms had either been conquered by Nicene neighbors (Ostrogoths, Vandals, Burgundians) or their rulers had accepted Nicene Christianity (Visigoths, Lombards).

The [[Franks]] were unique among the Germanic peoples in that they entered the empire as pagans and converted to Nicene (Catholic) Christianity directly, guided by their king [[Clovis I|Clovis]].&lt;ref&gt;Frassetto, Michael, ''Encyclopedia of barbarian Europe'', (ABC-CLIO, 2003), 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remnants in the West, 5th-7th century==
However, much of southeastern Europe and [[central Europe]], including many of the [[Goths]] and [[Vandals]] respectively, had embraced Arianism (the [[Visigoths]] converted to Arian Christianity in 376), which led to Arianism being a religious factor in various wars in the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|The inhibiting and paralyzing force of superstitious beliefs penetrated to every department of life, and the most primary and elementary activities of society were influenced. War, for example, was not a simple matter of a test of strength and courage, but supernatural matters had to be taken carefully into consideration. When [[Clovis I|Clovis]] said of the Goths in southern Gaul, &quot;I take it hard that these Arians should hold a part of the Gauls; let us go with God's aid and conquer them and bring the land under our dominion&quot;, [note: see p. 45 (Book II:37)] he was not speaking in a hypocritical or arrogant manner but in real accordance with the religious sentiment of the time. What he meant was that the Goths, being heretics, were at once enemies of the true God and inferior to the orthodox Franks in their supernatural backing. Considerations of duty, strategy, and self-interest all reinforced one another in [[Clovis I|Clovis]]'s mind. However, it was not always the orthodox side that won. We hear of a battle fought a few years before Gregory became bishop of Tours between king [[Sigebert I|Sigibert]] and the [[Huns]], [note: Book IV:29] in which the Huns &quot; by the use of magic arts caused various false appearances to arise before their enemies and overcame them decisively. Medieval Study Guide to Gregory of Tours History of the Franks.|St [[Gregory of Tours]] |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the west, organized Arianism survived in [[North Africa]], in Hispania, and parts of Italy until it was finally suppressed in the 6th and 7th centuries.

==&quot;Arian&quot; as a polemical epithet==
In many ways, the conflict around Arian beliefs in the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries helped firmly define the centrality of the Trinity in Nicene Christian theology. As the first major intra-Christian conflict after Christianity's legalization, the struggle between Nicenes and Arians left a deep impression on the institutional memory of Nicene churches.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Archbishop Dmitri of the [[Orthodox Church in America]] said [[Islam]] is the largest descendant of Arianism today. There is some superficial similarity in Islam's teaching that Jesus was a great prophet, but very distinct from God.

Thus, over the past 1,500 years, some Christians have used the term ''Arian'' to refer to those groups that see themselves as worshiping Jesus Christ or respecting his teachings, but do not hold to the [[Nicene creed]]. Despite the frequency with which this name is used as a polemical label, there has been no historically continuous survival of Arianism into the modern era.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Arianism resurfaces after the Reformation, 16th century==
Following the [[Protestant Reformation]] from 1517, it did not take long for Arian and other [[non-trinitarian]] views to resurface. The first recorded English [[antitrinitarian]] was [[John Assheton]] who was forced to recant before [[Thomas Cranmer]] in 1548. At the [[Anabaptist]] [[Council of Venice]] 1550, the early Italian instigators of the [[Radical Reformation]] committed to the views of [[Servetus]] (d.1553), and these were promulgated by [[Giorgio Biandrata]] and others into Poland and Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Bainton]], ''Hunted Heretic. The Life and Death of Michael Servetus''&lt;/ref&gt; The antitrinitarian wing of the Polish Reformation separated from the [[Calvinist]] ''ecclesia maior'' to form the ''ecclesia minor'' or [[Polish Brethren]]. These were commonly referred to as &quot;Arians&quot; due to their rejection of the Trinity, though in fact the [[Socinians]], as they were later known, went further than Arius to the position of [[Photinus]]. The epithet &quot;Arian&quot; was also applied to the early [[Unitarians]] such as [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|John Biddle]] though in denial of the [[pre-existence of Christ]] they were again largely Socinians not Arians.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Huntston Williams]]. ''The Radical Reformation'', 3rd edition. Volume 15 of Sixteenth Century Essays and Studies. Ann Arbor, MI: Edwards Brothers, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th Century the &quot;dominant trend&quot; in Britain, particularly in [[Latitudinarianism]], was towards Arianism, with which the names of [[Samuel Clarke]], [[Benjamin Hoadly]] and [[William Whiston]] are associated.&lt;ref&gt;William Gibson, Robert G. Ingram ''Religious identities in Britain, 1660-1832'' p92&lt;/ref&gt; To quote the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'''s article on Arianism: &quot;In modern times some [[Unitarians]] are virtually Arians in that they are unwilling either to reduce Christ to a mere human being or to attribute to him a divine nature identical with that of the Father.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Arianism.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica 2007 Deluxe Edition. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, their doctrines cannot be considered representative of traditional Arian doctrines or vice-versa.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

A Christian movement reputed to practice a form of Arianism (or &quot;[[Semi-Arianism]]&quot; {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}) are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watchtower.org/e/ti/article_04.htm |publisher=
Jehovah's Witnesses Official Website |title=How Did the Trinity Doctrine Develop?}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consider Jesus Christ to be divine and unlike other created beings, but not equal to the one God. And although they are not Trinitarians or Athanasians, they disagree with Arius’ views in many respects. Arius, for example, denied that the Son could really know the Father{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} while Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Son ‘fully knows’ the Father, and also that the Son, as 'the Word who became flesh', is “the one that has explained him.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, by Jehovah's Witnesses, Mt 11:27 |url=http://www.watchtower.org/bible/mt/chapter_011.htm#bk27 |work=Joh 1:18 }}{{dead link|date=November 2010}} {{cite web |url=http://www.watchtower.org/bible/joh/chapter_001.htm#bk18 |title=?}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Mt 11:27; Joh 1:14, 18) They believe it is vital to come to know God. And although Arius did not accept Athanasius’ theory that the Holy Spirit was co-equal and of the same substance as the Father, he did consider the spirit to be a person or a high angel. Jehovah's Witnesses believe the Holy Spirit is not an actual person but rather is God’s divine breath, God's power in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Watchtower |year=1984 |volume=9/1 |pages= 25–30 |title=Should you believe in the Trinity? |url= http://www.watchtower.org/e/ti/index.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group that may be considered Arian is the [[Church of God (7th day) - Salem Conference]]. 

{{quotation|We believe in one true God who is the creator of all.  He is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent.  He sent his son to Earth to be a sacrifice for our sins.  He is a separate being from his son, Jesus.  The Holy Spirit is the power of God and not a separate being with a separate consciousness. We do not believe in the teaching of the Trinity, in which the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three parts of a single being who is God. We believe the Father and the Son are separate beings with separate consciousnesses and that the Holy Spirit is not a conscious being but instead the power of God.|FAQs - Does the Church of God (7th Day) believe in the Trinity?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchofgod-7thday.org/FAQs.html#Trinity]&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Other groups denying the Trinity are not necessarily Arian.
* [[Oneness Pentecostalism]] is a grouping of denominations and believers within the Pentecostal movement with various non-trinitarian views.
* [[Christadelphians]],&lt;ref&gt;Pearce F. ''Jesus: God the Son or Son of God?'' CMPA&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church of God General Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Buzzard]] and Charles Hunting ''The Doctrine of the Trinity: Christianity's Self-Inflicted Wound''&lt;/ref&gt; and other &quot;[[Biblical Unitarian]]s&quot; are typically [[Socinianism|Socinian]] in their Christology, not Arian.

'''Antoninus Pius''' ({{lang-la|Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius}};&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;&gt;Weigel, ''Antoninus Pius''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Antoninus' name would be inscribed as &lt;small&gt;TITVS AELIVS HADRIANVS ANTONINVS AVGVSTVS PIVS&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 19 September 86 – 7 March 161), also known as '''Antoninus''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 138 to 161. He was a member of the [[Nerva-Antonine dynasty]] and the [[Aurelia (gens)|Aurelii]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 150&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  He did not possess the [[sobriquet]] &quot;[[Pius]]&quot; until after his accession to the throne. Almost certainly, he earned the name &quot;Pius&quot; because he compelled the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deify]] his adoptive father [[Hadrian]];&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 54; Dio, 70:1:2&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Historia Augusta]], however, suggests that he may have earned the name by saving senators sentenced to death by Hadrian in his later years.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 55; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Hadrian'' 24.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Childhood and family===
He was the son and only child of [[Titus Aurelius Fulvus]], [[consul]] in 89&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 150&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; whose family came from [[Nemausus]] (modern [[Nîmes]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 523&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt;  He was born near [[Lanuvium]]&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Paul B., ''Religion in republican Italy'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, pg. 134; Canduci, pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother was Arria Fadilla. Antoninus’ father and paternal grandfather died when he was young and he was raised by [[Gnaeus Arrius Antoninus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 150&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; his maternal grandfather, reputed by contemporaries to be a man of integrity and culture and a friend of [[Pliny the Younger]]. His mother married Publius Julius Lupus (a man of consular rank) suffect consul in 98, and bore him two daughters Arria Lupula and Julia Fadilla.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 242; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 1:6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and children===
As a private citizen between 110 and 115, he married Annia Galeria [[Faustina the Elder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;/&gt;  They are believed to have enjoyed a happy marriage. Faustina was the daughter of consul [[Marcus Annius Verus]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 150&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rupilia]] Faustina (a half-sister to Roman Empress [[Vibia Sabina]]). Faustina was a beautiful woman, renowned for her wisdom. She spent her whole life caring for the poor and assisting the most disadvantaged Romans.

Faustina bore Antoninus four children, two sons and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 34; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 1:7&lt;/ref&gt; They were:
* Marcus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magie, David 1921&quot;&gt;Magie, David, ''Historia Augusta'' (1921), Life of Antoninus Pius, Note 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marcus Galerius Aurelius Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magie, David 1921&quot;/&gt;  His name appears on a Greek Imperial coin.
* Aurelia Fadilla (died in 135); she married Lucius Lamia Silvanus, consul 145. She appeared to have no children with her husband and her sepulchral inscription has been found in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Magie, David, ''Historia Augusta'' (1921), Life of Antoninus Pius, Note 7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Annia Galeria Faustina Minor or [[Faustina the Younger]] (between 125–130–175), a future Roman Empress, married her maternal cousin, future Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] in 146.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 523&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

When Faustina died in 141, Antoninus was greatly bereaved.&lt;ref&gt;Bury, pg. 528&lt;/ref&gt;  In honor of her memory, Antoninus asked the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to deify her as a goddess, and he authorised the construction of a temple to be built in the [[Roman Forum]] in her name, with priestesses serving in her temple.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 77; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 6:7&lt;/ref&gt;  He had various coins with her portrait struck in her honor. These coins were scripted ‘DIVAE FAUSTINA’ and were elaborately decorated. He further created a charity which he founded and called it ''Puellae Faustinianae'' or ''Girls of Faustina'', which assisted orphaned girls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;/&gt;  Finally, Antoninus created a new ''alimenta'' (see [[Grain supply to the city of Rome]]).

===Favor with Hadrian===
Having filled with more than usual success the offices of [[quaestor]] and [[praetor]],&lt;ref&gt;Traver, Andrew G., ''From polis to empire, the ancient world, c. 800 B.C.-A.D. 500'', (2002) pg. 33; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 2:9&lt;/ref&gt; he obtained the consulship in 120;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;/&gt; he was next appointed by the Emperor [[Hadrian]] as one of the four [[proconsul]]s to administer [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 149&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 149&lt;/ref&gt; then greatly increased his reputation by his conduct as [[proconsul]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], probably during 134-135.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 149&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 149&lt;/ref&gt;  He acquired much favor with the Emperor Hadrian, who adopted him as his son and successor on 25 February 138,&lt;ref&gt;Bowman,pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; after the death of his first adopted son [[Lucius Aelius]],&lt;ref&gt;Bury, pg. 517&lt;/ref&gt; on the condition that Antoninus would in turn adopt Marcus Annius Verus, the son of his wife's brother, and Lucius, son of Aelius Verus, who afterwards became the emperors [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;/&gt;

==Emperor==
[[Image:AntoninusAureus.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Aureus]] of Antoninus Pius.]]
[[Image:Roman Empire in 150 AD.png|300px|thumb|left|The Roman Empire during the reign of Antoninus Pius.]]
[[Image:Antoninus Pius BM Sc1463.jpg|thumb|right|Another version of the standardised imperial portrait; from the house of Jason Magnus at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], North Africa ([[British Museum]])]]
On his accession, Antoninus' name became &quot;Imperator Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pontifex Maximus&quot;. One of his first acts as Emperor was to persuade the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to grant divine honours to Hadrian, which they had at first refused;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 151&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 151&lt;/ref&gt; his efforts to persuade the Senate to grant these honours is the most likely reason given for his title of ''Pius'' (dutiful in affection; compare ''[[pietas]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 55; Canduci, pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  Two other reasons for this title are that he would support his aged father-in-law with his hand at Senate meetings, and that he had saved those men that Hadrian, during his period of ill-health, had condemned to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 523&quot;&gt;Bury,pg. 523&lt;/ref&gt;  He built temples, theaters, and mausoleums, promoted the arts and sciences, and bestowed honours and financial rewards upon the teachers of [[rhetoric]] and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;&gt;Weigel,''Antoninus Pius''&lt;/ref&gt;  Antoninus made few initial changes when he became emperor, leaving intact as far as possible the arrangements instituted by Hadrian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 151&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no records of any military related acts in his time in which he participated. One modern scholar has written &quot;It is almost certain not only that at no time in his life did he ever see, let alone command, a Roman army, but that, throughout the twenty-three years of his reign, he never went within five hundred miles of a legion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Wilkes, ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Volume LXXV 1985, ISSN 0075-4358, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  His reign was the most peaceful in the entire history of the [[Principate]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 525&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 525&lt;/ref&gt; while there were several military disturbances throughout the Empire in his time, in [[Mauretania]], [[Iudaea Province|Iudaea]], and amongst the [[Brigantes]] in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], none of them are considered serious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 525&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 525&lt;/ref&gt;  It was however in Britain that Antoninus decided to follow a new, more aggressive path, with the appointment of a new governor in 139, [[Quintus Lollius Urbicus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 151&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  

Under instructions from the emperor, he undertook an invasion of southern [[Scotland]], winning some significant victories, and constructing the [[Antonine Wall]]&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Firth of Forth]] to the [[Firth of Clyde]], although it was soon abandoned for reasons that are still not quite clear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 155&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also some troubles in [[Dacia Inferior]] which required the granting of additional powers to the [[procurator]] governor and the dispatchment of additional soldiers to the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 155&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Also during his reign the governor of [[Upper Germany]], probably Caius Popillius Carus Pedo, built new fortifications in the [[Agri Decumates]], advancing the [[Limes Germanicus]] fifteen miles forward in his province and neighboring [[Raetia]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Antoninus was virtually unique among emperors in that he dealt with these crises without leaving Italy once during his reign,&lt;ref&gt;Speidel, Michael P., ''Riding for Caesar: The Roman Emperors' Horse Guards'', Harvard University Press, 1997, pg. 50; Canduci, pg. 40&lt;/ref&gt; but instead dealt with provincial matters of war and peace through their governors or through imperial letters to the cities such as Ephesus (of which some were publicly displayed). This style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generations.&lt;ref&gt;See Victor, 15:3&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the public transactions of this period there is only the scantiest of information, but, to judge by what is extant, those twenty-two years were not remarkably eventful in comparison to those before and after his reign. However, he did take a great interest in the revision and practice of the law throughout the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 526&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 526&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he was not an innovator, he would not follow the absolute letter of the law; rather he was driven by concerns over humanity and equality, and introduced into [[Roman law]] many important new principles based upon this notion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 526&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 526&lt;/ref&gt;  

In this, the emperor was assisted by five chief lawyers: L. Fulvius Aburnius Valens, an author of legal treatises; L. Volusius Maecianus, chosen to conduct the legal studies of Marcus Aurelius, and author of a large work on Fidei Commissa (Testamentary Trusts); L. Ulpius Marcellus, a prolific writer; and two others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 526&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 526&lt;/ref&gt;  His reign saw the appearance of the ''Institutes of Gaius'', an elementary legal manual for beginners (see [[Gaius (jurist)]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 526&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 526&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoninus passed measures to facilitate the [[enfranchisement]] of [[slavery|slaves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 527&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 527&lt;/ref&gt;  In criminal law, Antoninus introduced the important principle that accused persons are not to be treated as guilty before trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 527&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 527&lt;/ref&gt;  He also asserted the principle, that the trial was to be held, and the punishment inflicted, in the place where the crime had been committed. He mitigated the use of [[torture]] in examining slaves by certain limitations. Thus he prohibited the application of torture to children under fourteen years, though this rule had exceptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 527&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 527&lt;/ref&gt;

One highlight during his reign occurred in 148, with the nine-hundredth anniversary of the foundation of [[Rome]] being celebrated by the hosting of magnificent games in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg, 154&lt;/ref&gt;  It lasted a number of days, and a host of exotic animals were killed, including elephants, giraffes, tigers, rhinoceroses, crocodiles and hippopotami. While this increased Antoninus’s popularity, the frugal emperor had to debase the [[Roman currency]]. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 89% to 83.5% — the actual silver weight dropping from 2.88&amp;nbsp;grams to 2.68&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 155&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University &quot;Roman Currency of the Principate&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars place Antoninus Pius as the leading candidate for fulfilling the role as a friend of Rabbi [[Judah haNasi|Judah the Prince]]. According to the [[Talmud]] (Avodah Zarah 10a-b), Rabbi Judah was very wealthy and greatly revered in Rome. He had a close friendship with &quot;Antoninus&quot;, possibly Antoninus Pius,&lt;ref&gt;A. Mischcon, Abodah Zara, p.10a Soncino, 1988. Mischcon cites various sources, &quot;SJ Rappaport... is of opinion that our Antoninus is Antoninus Pius.&quot; Other opinions cited suggest &quot;Antoninus&quot; was [[Caracalla]], [[Lucius Verus]] or [[Alexander Severus]].&lt;/ref&gt; who would consult Rabbi Judah on various worldly and spiritual matters.

The emperor and his ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' were deified after their death by [[Marcus Aurelius]].]]

After the longest reign since Augustus (surpassing [[Tiberius]] by a couple of months), Antoninus died of fever at [[Lorium]] in [[Etruria]],&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, pg. 156; Victor, 15:7&lt;/ref&gt; about twelve miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) from Rome, on 7 March 161,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman, pg. 156&quot;&gt;Bowman, pg. 156&lt;/ref&gt; giving the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when the [[tribune]] of the night-watch came to ask the password—&quot;aequanimitas&quot; (equanimity).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 532&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 532&lt;/ref&gt;  His body was placed in [[Castel Sant'Angelo|Hadrian's mausoleum]], a [[Column of Antoninus Pius|column]] was dedicated to him on the [[Campus Martius]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigel, Antoninus Pius&quot;/&gt; and the [[Temple of Antoninus and Faustina|temple]] he had built in the Forum in 141 to his deified wife Faustina was rededicated to the deified Faustina and the deified Antoninus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bury, pg. 532&quot;&gt;Bury, pg. 532&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
The only account of his life handed down to us is that of the ''[[Augustan History]]'', an unreliable and mostly fabricated work. Nevertheless, it still contains information that is considered reasonably sound – for instance, it is the only source that mentions the erection of the Antonine Wall in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;  Antoninus is unique among Roman emperors in that he has no other biographies. Historians have therefore turned to public records for what details we know.

===In later scholarship===
Antoninus in many ways was the ideal of the landed gentleman praised not only by ancient Romans, but also by later scholars of classical history, such as [[Edward Gibbon]] or the author of the article on Antoninus Pius in the ninth edition of the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica]]:
{{quote|A few months afterwards, on Hadrian's death, he was enthusiastically welcomed to the throne by the Roman people, who, for once, were not disappointed in their anticipation of a happy reign. For Antoninus came to his new office with simple tastes, kindly disposition, extensive experience, a well-trained intelligence and the sincerest desire for the welfare of his subjects. Instead of plundering to support his prodigality, he emptied his private treasury to assist distressed provinces and cities, and everywhere exercised rigid economy (hence the nickname κυμινοπριστης &quot;cummin-splitter&quot;). Instead of exaggerating into treason whatever was susceptible of unfavorable interpretation, he turned the very conspiracies that were formed against him into opportunities for demonstrating his clemency. Instead of stirring up persecution against the Christians, he extended to them the strong hand of his protection throughout the empire. Rather than give occasion to that oppression which he regarded as inseparable from an emperor's progress through his dominions, he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome, or its neighbourhood.}}

Later historians had a more nuanced view of his reign. According to the historian [[J. B. Bury]], {{quote|however estimable the man, Antoninus was hardly a great statesman. The rest which the Empire enjoyed under his auspices had been rendered possible through Hadrian’s activity, and was not due to his own exertions; on the other hand, he carried the policy of peace at any price too far, and so entailed calamities on the state after his death. He not only had no originality or power of initiative, but he had not even the insight or boldness to work further on the new lines marked out by Hadrian.&lt;ref&gt;Bury, pg. 524&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Inevitably, the surviving evidence is not complete enough to determine whether one should interpret, with older scholars, that he wisely curtailed the activities of the Roman Empire to a careful minimum, or perhaps that he was uninterested in events away from Rome and [[Italy]] and his inaction contributed to the pressing troubles that faced not only Marcus Aurelius but also the emperors of the third century.  German historian [[Ernst Kornemann]] has had it in his ''Römische Geschichte'' [2 vols., ed. by H. Bengtson, Stuttgart 1954] that the reign of Antoninus comprised &quot;a succession of grossly wasted opportunities,&quot; given the upheavals that were to come. There is more to this argument, given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus' passing.  Kornemann's brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders.

}}

In [[cryptography]], the '''Advanced Encryption Standard''' ('''AES''') is a [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric-key]] [[encryption]] standard adopted by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]. The standard comprises three [[block cipher]]s, AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256, adopted from a larger collection originally published as '''Rijndael.''' Each of these ciphers has a 128-bit block size, with [[key (cryptography)|key]] sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bits, respectively. The AES ciphers have been analyzed extensively and are now used worldwide, as was the case with its predecessor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IKZ/is_3_107?pnum=2&amp;opg=90984479 |title=NIST reports measurable success of Advanced Encryption Standard | work=Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology | first=Harold B. | last=Westlund | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES).

AES was announced by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) as U.S. [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] PUB 197 (FIPS 197) on November 26, 2001 after a 5-year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated before Rijndael was selected as the most suitable (see [[Advanced Encryption Standard process]] for more details). It became effective as a Federal government standard on May 26, 2002 after approval by the Secretary of Commerce. It is available in many different encryption packages. AES is the first publicly accessible and open [[cipher]] approved by the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] for [[top secret]] information (see [[Advanced Encryption Standard#Security|Security of AES]], below).

The Rijndael [[cipher]] was developed by two [[Belgium|Belgian]] cryptographers, [[Joan Daemen]] and [[Vincent Rijmen]], and submitted by them to the AES selection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=U.S. Selects a New Encryption Technique |author=John Schwartz |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 3, 2000 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/03/business/technology-us-selects-a-new-encryption-technique.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Rijndael''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈrɛindaːl}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rijndael.info/audio/rijndael_pronunciation.wav |title='Rijndael' pronunciation}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a wordplay based upon the names of the two inventors.

== Description of the cipher ==
AES is based on a design principle known as a [[Substitution-permutation network|Substitution permutation network]]. It is fast in both [[computer software|software]] and [[hardware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schneier.com/paper-twofish-final.pdf |title=The Twofish Team’s Final Comments on AES Selection |author=Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall, Niels Ferguson, Tadayoshi Kohno, Mike Stay |date=May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike its predecessor, DES, AES does not use a [[Feistel network]].

AES has a fixed  [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] of 128 [[bit]]s and a [[key size]] of 128, 192, or 256 bits, whereas Rijndael can be specified with block and key sizes in any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 bits. The blocksize has a maximum of 256 bits, but the keysize has no theoretical maximum.

AES operates on a 4&amp;times;4 matrix of bytes, termed the ''state'' (versions of Rijndael with a larger block size have additional columns in the state). Most AES calculations are done in a special [[Finite field arithmetic|finite field]].

The AES cipher is specified as a number of repetitions of transformation rounds that convert the input plaintext into the final output of ciphertext. Each round consists of several processing steps, including one that depends on the encryption key. A set of reverse rounds are applied to transform ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same encryption key.

=== High-level description of the algorithm ===

# KeyExpansion&amp;mdash;round keys are derived from the cipher key using [[Rijndael key schedule|Rijndael's key schedule]]
# Initial Round
## &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;mdash;each byte of the state is combined with the round key using bitwise xor
# Rounds
## &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;mdash;a non-linear substitution step where each byte is replaced with another according to a [[Rijndael S-box|lookup table]].
## &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;mdash;a transposition step where each row of the state is shifted cyclically a certain number of steps.
## &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;mdash;a mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column.
## &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt;
# Final Round (no &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt;)
## &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt;
## &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt;
## &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt;

=== The &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt; step ===
[[Image:AES-SubBytes.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt; step, each byte in the state is replaced with its entry in a fixed 8-bit lookup table, ''S''; ''b&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''S(a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;)''.]]
In the &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt; step, each byte in the matrix is updated using an 8-bit [[substitution box]], the [[Rijndael S-box]]. This operation provides the non-linearity in the [[cipher]]. The S-box used is derived from the [[multiplicative inverse]] over '''[[Finite field|GF]]'''(''2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;''), known to have good non-linearity properties. To avoid attacks based on simple algebraic properties, the S-box is constructed by combining the inverse function with an invertible [[affine transformation]]. The S-box is also chosen to avoid any fixed points (and so is a [[derangement]]), and also any opposite fixed points.

=== The &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; step ===
[[Image:AES-ShiftRows.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; step, bytes in each row of the state are shifted cyclically to the left. The number of places each byte is shifted differs for each row.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; step operates on the rows of the state; it cyclically shifts the bytes in each row by a certain [[Offset (computer science)|offset]]. For AES, the first row is left unchanged. Each byte of the second row is shifted one to the left. Similarly, the third and fourth rows are shifted by offsets of two and three respectively. For the block of size 128 bits and 192 bits the shifting pattern is the same. In this way, each column of the output state of the &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; step is composed of bytes from each column of the input state. (Rijndael variants with a larger block size have slightly different offsets). In the case of the 256-bit block, the first row is unchanged and the shifting for second, third and fourth row is 1 byte, 3 bytes and 4 bytes respectively - this change only applies for the Rijndael cipher when used with a 256-bit block, as AES does not use 256-bit blocks.
Here Aij is from cipher text and Bij is from key.

=== The &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; step ===
[[Image:AES-MixColumns.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; step, each column of the state is multiplied with a fixed polynomial ''c(x)''.]]
In the &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; step, the four bytes of each column of the state are combined using an invertible [[linear transformation]]. The &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; function takes four bytes as input and outputs four bytes, where each input byte affects all four output bytes. Together with &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; provides [[diffusion (cryptography)|diffusion]] in the cipher.

During this operation, each column is multiplied by the known matrix that for the 128 bit key is

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
3 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The multiplication operation is defined as: multiplication by 1 means leaving unchanged, multiplication by 2 means shifting byte to the left and multiplication by 3 means shifting to the left and then performing [[xor]] with the initial unshifted value. After shifting, a conditional [[xor]] with 0x11B should be performed if the shifted value is larger than 0xFF.

In more general sense, each column is treated as a polynomial over '''GF'''(''2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;'') and is then multiplied modulo x&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;+1 with a fixed polynomial c(x) = 0x03 · x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + x + 0x02. The coefficients are displayed in their [[hexadecimal]] equivalent of the binary representation of bit polynomials from '''GF'''(2)[x]. The &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; step can also be viewed as a multiplication by a particular [[MDS matrix]] in a [[finite field]]. This process is described further in the article [[Rijndael mix columns]].
Using the polynomial one matrix was created. Using that matrix add with o/p came from previous state.

=== The &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt; step ===
[[Image:AES-AddRoundKey.svg|right|320px|thumbnail|In the &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt; step, each byte of the state is combined with a byte of the round subkey using the [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operation (⊕).]]
In the &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt; step, the subkey is combined with the state. For each round, a subkey is derived from the main [[key (cryptography)|key]] using [[Rijndael key schedule|Rijndael's key schedule]]; each subkey is the same size as the state. The subkey is added by combining each byte of the state with the corresponding byte of the subkey using bitwise [[Exclusive or|XOR]].

=== Optimization of the cipher ===
On systems with 32-bit or larger words, it is possible to speed up execution of this cipher by combining  &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt;, and transforming them into a sequence of table lookups. This requires four 256-entry 32-bit tables, which utilizes a total of four kilobytes (4096 bytes) of memory&amp;mdash;one kilobyte for each table. A round can now be done with 16 table lookups and 12 32-bit exclusive-or operations, followed by four 32-bit exclusive-or operations in the &lt;tt&gt;AddRoundKey&lt;/tt&gt; step.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/index/UVX5NQGNN55VK199.pdf &quot;Efficient software implementation of AES on 32-bit platforms&quot;.] Lecture Notes in Computer Science: 2523. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

If the resulting four kilobyte table size is too large for a given target platform, the table lookup operation can be performed with a single 256-entry 32-bit (i.e. 1 kilobyte) table by the use of circular rotates.

Using a byte-oriented approach, it is possible to combine the &lt;tt&gt;SubBytes&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ShiftRows&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;MixColumns&lt;/tt&gt; steps into a single round operation.[http://code.google.com/p/byte-oriented-aes]

== Security ==
Until May 2009, the only successful published attacks against the full AES were [[side-channel attack]]s on some specific implementations. The [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) reviewed all the AES finalists, including Rijndael, and stated that all of them were secure enough for U.S. Government non-classified data. In June 2003, the U.S. Government announced that AES may be used to protect [[classified information]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm (i.e., 128, 192 and 256) are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level. TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths. The implementation of AES in products intended to protect national security systems and/or information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/documents/aes/CNSS15FS.pdf |title=National Policy on the Use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to Protect National Security Systems and National Security Information |author=Lynn Hathaway |date=June 2003  |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

AES has 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys. By 2006, the best known attacks were on 7 rounds for 128-bit keys, 8 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 9 rounds for 256-bit keys.&lt;ref name=improved&gt;[[John Kelsey (cryptanalyst)|John Kelsey]], [[Stefan Lucks]], [[Bruce Schneier]], [[Mike Stay]], [[David A. Wagner|David Wagner]], and [[Doug Whiting]], ''Improved Cryptanalysis of Rijndael'', [[Fast Software Encryption]], 2000 pp213&amp;ndash;230 [http://www.schneier.com/paper-rijndael.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Known attacks===
For cryptographers, a [[cryptanalysis|cryptographic]] &quot;break&quot; is anything faster than a [[brute force attack]] - trying every possible key. Thus, an attack against a 256-bit-key AES requiring 2&lt;sup&gt;200&lt;/sup&gt; operations (compared to 2&lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt; possible keys) would be considered a break, even though 2&lt;sup&gt;200&lt;/sup&gt; operations would still take far longer than the age of the universe to complete. The largest successful publicly-known [[brute force attack]] has been against a 64-bit [[RC5]] key by [[distributed.net]].&lt;ref name=ZD20060430&gt;{{cite web

AES has a fairly simple algebraic description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~sean/ |title=Sean Murphy |publisher=University of London |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a theoretical attack, termed the &quot;[[XSL attack]]&quot;, was announced by [[Nicolas Courtois]] and [[Josef Pieprzyk]], purporting to show a weakness in the AES algorithm due to its simple description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0209.html | title = AES News, Crypto-Gram Newsletter, September 15, 2002 | author = Bruce Schneier | accessdate = 2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, other papers have shown that the attack as originally presented is unworkable; see [[XSL_attack#Application_to_block_ciphers|XSL attack on block ciphers]].

During the AES process, developers of competing algorithms wrote of Rijndael, &quot;...we are concerned about [its] use...in security-critical applications.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rijndael-algebraic&quot;&gt;

on August 3, 2009. This new attack, by Alex Biryukov, Orr Dunkelman, Nathan Keller, Dmitry Khovratovich, and [[Adi Shamir]], is against AES-256 that uses only two related keys and 2&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; time to recover the complete 256-bit key of a 9-round version, or 2&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt; time for a 10-round version with a stronger type of related subkey attack, or 2&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt; time for an 11-round version. 256-bit AES uses 14 rounds, so these attacks aren't effective against full AES.

In November 2009, the first [[known-key distinguishing attack]] against a reduced 8-round version of AES-128 was released as a preprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web
|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/531 
|title=Super-Sbox Cryptanalysis: Improved Attacks for AES-like permutations
|author=Henri Gilbert
 |coauthors=Thomas Peyrin
|date=2009-11-09
|accessdate=2010-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This known-key distinguishing attack is an improvement of the rebound or the start-from-the-middle attacks for AES-like permutations, which view two consecutive rounds of permutation as the application of a so-called Super-Sbox. It works on the 8-round version of AES-128, with a time complexity of 2&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;, and a memory complexity of 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;.

In July 2010 Vincent Rijmen published an ironic paper on &quot;chosen-key-relations-in-the-middle&quot; attacks on AES-128.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/337.pdf |title=Practical-Titled Attack on AES-128 Using Chosen-Text Relations |author=Vincent Rijmen |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Side-channel attacks ===&lt;!-- possibly out of date? --&gt;
[[Side channel attack|Side-channel attack]]s do not attack the underlying cipher and so have nothing to do with its security as described here, but attack implementations of the cipher on systems which inadvertently leak data. There are several such known attacks on certain implementations of AES.

In April 2005, [[Daniel J. Bernstein|D.J. Bernstein]] announced a cache-timing attack that he used to break a custom server that used [[OpenSSL]]'s AES encryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cr.yp.to/papers.html#cachetiming |title=Index of formal scientific papers |publisher=Cr.yp.to |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom server was designed to give out as much timing information as possible (the server reports back the number of machine cycles taken by the encryption operation), and the attack required over 200 million chosen plaintexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/05/aes_timing_atta_1.html | title = AES Timing Attack | author = Bruce Schneier | accessdate = 2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, Dag Arne Osvik, [[Adi Shamir]] and Eran Tromer presented a paper demonstrating several cache-timing attacks against AES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~tromer/papers/cache.pdf |title=Cache Attacks and Countermeasures: the Case of AES |format=PDF |date=2005-11-20 |author=Dag Arne Osvik1|coauthors =Adi Shamir2 and Eran Tromer2 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; One attack was able to obtain an entire AES key after only 800 operations triggering encryptions, in a total of 65 milliseconds. This attack requires the attacker to be able to run programs on the same system or platform that is performing AES.

In December 2009 an attack on some hardware implementations was published that used [[differential fault analysis]] and allows recovery of key with complexity of &lt;math&gt;2^{32}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/581.pdf |title=A Diagonal Fault Attack on the Advanced Encryption Standard |author=Dhiman Saha, Debdeep Mukhopadhyay, Dipanwita RoyChowdhury |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 Endre Bangerter, David Gullasch and Stephan Krenn published a paper which described a practical approach to a &quot;near real time&quot; recovery of secret keys from AES-128 without the need for either cipher text or plaintext. The approach also works on AES-128 implementations that use compression tables, such as OpenSSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/594.pdf |title=Cache Games – Bringing Access-Based Cache Attacks on AES to Practice |author=Endre Bangerter, David Gullasch and Stephan Krenn |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like some earlier attacks this one requires the ability to run arbitrary code on the system performing the AES encryption.

== NIST/CSEC validation ==
The [[CMVP|Cryptographic Module Validation Program]] (CMVP) is operated jointly by the United States Government's [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) Computer Security Division and the [[Communications Security Establishment]] (CSE) of the Government of Canada. The use of validated cryptographic modules is required by the United States Government for all unclassified uses of cryptography. The Government of Canada also recommends the use of [[FIPS 140]] validated cryptographic modules in unclassified applications of its departments.

Although NIST publication 197 (&quot;FIPS 197&quot;) is the unique document that covers the AES algorithm, vendors typically approach the CMVP under FIPS 140 and ask to have several algorithms (such as [[Triple DES|Triple&amp;nbsp;DES]] or [[SHA1]]) validated at the same time. Therefore, it is rare to find cryptographic modules that are uniquely FIPS 197 validated and NIST itself does not generally take the time to list FIPS 197 validated modules separately on its public web site. Instead, FIPS 197 validation is typically just listed as an &quot;FIPS approved: AES&quot; notation (with a specific FIPS 197 certificate number) in the current list of FIPS 140 validated cryptographic modules.  

The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)[http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/index.html] allows for independent validation of the correct implementation of the AES algorithm at a reasonable cost{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. Successful validation results in being listed on the NIST validations page. This testing is a pre-requisite for the FIPS 140-2 module validation described below.  

FIPS 140-2 validation is challenging to achieve both technically and fiscally{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. There is a standardized battery of tests as well as an element of source code review that must be passed over a period of a few weeks. The cost to perform these tests through an approved laboratory can be significant (e.g., well over $30,000 US){{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and does not include the time it takes to write, test, document and prepare a module for validation. After validation, modules must be re-submitted and re-evaluated if they are changed in any way. This can vary from simple paperwork updates if the security functionality did not change to a more substantial set of re-testing if the security functionality was impacted by the change.

== Test vectors ==
Test vectors are a set of known ciphers for a given input and key.  [[NIST]] distributes the reference of AES test vectors as [http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip AES Known Answer Test (KAT) Vectors (in ZIP format)].

== Performance ==
Good performance (high speed and low RAM requirements) were an explicit goal of the AES selection process. Thus AES performs well on a wide variety of hardware, from 8-bit smartcards to high-performance computers.

On a [[Pentium Pro]], AES encryption requires 18 clock cycles / byte,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to a throughput of about 11 MiB/s for a 200&amp;nbsp;MHz processor. On a [[Pentium M]] 1.7&amp;nbsp;GHz throughput is about 60 MiB/s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{For|the fungus|Ergot}}

An '''Argot''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|ɑr|ɡ|oʊ}}; [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] for &quot;[[slang]]&quot;) is a [[secret language]] used by various groups—including, but not limited to, thieves and other criminals—to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations. The term ''argot'' is also used to refer to the informal specialized vocabulary from a particular field of study, hobby, job, sport, etc.  {{Wiktionary}}

The author [[Victor Hugo]] was one of the first to research argot extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/hist255/popcorn/convicts2.html | title=Interesting Facts about Convicts of France in the 19th Century | author=Schwartz, Robert M. |publisher=Mt. Holyoke University}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes it in his novel, ''[[Les Misérables]]'', as the language of the dark; at one point, he says, &quot;What is argot; properly speaking? Argot is the language of misery.&quot;

[[Bruce Sterling]] defines argot as &quot;the deliberately hermetic language of a small knowledge [[clique]]... a super-specialized geek cult language that has no traction in the real world.&quot; For example: &quot;He philosophized and recited baseball statistics in a Brooklyn argot that was fast-fading.&quot;

The earliest known record of ''argot'' was in a 1628 document.  The word was probably derived from the contemporary name, ''les argotiers'', given to a group of thieves at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Guiraud, Pierre, ''L'Argot. Que sais-je?'', Paris: PUF, 1958, p. 700&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the strictest definition, an ''argot'' is a proper language, with its own grammar and style. But, such complete secret languages are rare, because the speakers usually have some public language in common, on which the argot is largely based. Argots are mainly versions of other languages with a part of its vocabulary replaced by words unknown to the larger public. For example, the term is used to describe systems such as ''[[verlan]]'' and ''[[louchébem]]'', which retain French syntax and apply transformations only to individual words (and often only to a certain subset of words, such as nouns, or semantic content words).&lt;ref name=&quot;valdman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

'''Anisotropy''' ({{IPA-en|ˌænaɪˈsɒtrəpi|}}) is the property of being directionally dependent, as opposed to [[isotropy]], which implies identical properties in all directions. It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's physical or mechanical properties (absorbance, refractive index, conductivity, tensile strength, etc.) An example of anisotropy is the light coming through a [[polarizer]].  An example of an anisotropic material is wood, which is easier to split along [[wood grain|its grain]] than against it.

==Fields of interest==
===Computer graphics===

In the field of [[computer graphics]], an anisotropic surface will change in appearance as it is rotated about its geometric [[surface normal|normal]], as is the case with [[velvet]].

[[Anisotropic filtering]] (AF) is a method of enhancing the image quality of textures on surfaces that are far away and steeply angled with respect to the point of view. Older techniques, such as [[bilinear filtering|bilinear]] and [[trilinear filtering]] don't take account of the angle a surface is viewed from, which can result in [[aliasing]] or blurring of textures. By reducing detail in one direction more than another, these effects can be reduced.

=== Chemistry ===
A chemical anisotropic [[filter (chemistry)|filter]], as used to filter particles, is a filter with increasingly smaller interstitial spaces in the direction of filtration so that the [[proximal]] [[region]]s filter out larger particles and [[distal]] regions increasingly remove smaller pales, resulting in greater flow-through and more efficient filtration.

In [[NMR spectroscopy]], the orientation of nuclei with respect to the applied magnetic field determines their [[chemical shift]].  In this context, anisotropic systems refer to the electron distribution of molecules with abnormally high electron density, like the pi system of [[benzene]]. This abnormal electron density affects the applied magnetic field and causes the observed chemical shift to change.

In [[fluorescence spectroscopy]], the [[fluorescence anisotropy]], calculated from the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] properties of fluorescence from samples excited with plane-polarized light, is used, e.g., to determine the shape of a macromolecule.
Anisotropy measurements reveal the average angular displacement of the fluorophore that occurs between absorption and subsequent emission of a photon.

=== Real-world imagery===
Images of a gravity-bound or man-made environment are particularly anisotropic in the orientation domain, with more image structure located at orientations parallel with or orthogonal to the direction of gravity (vertical and horizontal).

===Physics===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Birefringence]] --&gt;
[[Image:Plasma-lamp 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A [[plasma globe|plasma lamp]] displaying the nature of [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]], in this case, the phenomenon of &quot;filamentation&quot;]]
[[Cosmologists]] use the term to describe the uneven temperature distribution of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. There is evidence for a so-called &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.newscientist.com/article/mg19425994.000-axis-of-evil-a-cause-for-cosmic-concern.html 'Axis of evil' a cause for cosmic concern – space – 13 April 2007 – New Scientist Space&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in the early Universe that is at odds with the currently favored theory of rapid expansion after the [[Big Bang]]. Cosmic anisotropy has also been seen in the alignment of galaxies' rotation axes and polarisation angles of quasars.

[[Physicists]] use the term anisotropy to describe direction-dependent properties of materials. [[Magnetic anisotropy]], for example, may occur in a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], so that its magnetic field is oriented in a preferred direction. Plasmas may also show &quot;filamentation&quot; (such as that seen in [[lightning]] or a [[plasma globe]]) that is directional.

An anisotropic liquid is one which has the fluidity of a normal liquid, but has an average structural order relative to each other along the molecular axis, unlike water or [[chloroform]], which contain no structural ordering of the molecules. [[Liquid crystals]] are examples of anisotropic liquids.

Some materials [[heat conduction|conduct heat]] in a way that is isotropic, that is independent of spatial orientation around the heat source.  It is more common for heat conduction to be anisotropic, which implies that detailed geometric modeling of typically diverse materials being thermally managed is required. The materials used to transfer and reject heat from the heat source in [[electronics]] are often anisotropic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Many [[crystal]]s are anisotropic to [[light]] (&quot;optical anisotropy&quot;), and exhibit properties such as [[birefringence]]. [[Crystal optics]] describes light propagation in these media. An &quot;axis of anisotropy&quot; is defined as the axis along which isotropy is broken (or an axis of symmetry, such as normal to crystalline layers). Some materials can have multiple such [[optical axis|optical axes]].

===Geophysics===
[[Seismic anisotropy]] is the variation of seismic wavespeed with direction. Seismic anisotropy is an indicator of long range order in a material, where features smaller than the seismic [[wavelength]] (e.g., crystals, cracks, pores, layers or inclusions) have a dominant alignment. This alignment leads to a directional variation of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] wavespeed. Measuring the effects of anisotropy in seismic data can provide important information about processes and mineralogy in the Earth; indeed, significant seismic anisotropy has been detected in the Earth's [[crust]], [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[inner core]].

[[Geological]] formations with distinct layers of [[sedimentary]] material can exhibit electrical anisotropy; [[electrical conductivity]] in one direction (e.g. parallel to a layer), is different from that in another (e.g. perpendicular to a layer). This property is used in the gas and [[oil exploration]] industry to identify [[hydrocarbon]]-bearing sands in sequences of [[sand]] and [[shale]]. Sand-bearing hydrocarbon assets have high [[resistivity]] (low conductivity), whereas shales have lower resistivity. [[Formation evaluation]] instruments measure this conductivity/resistivity and the results are used to help find oil and gas wells.

The [[hydraulic conductivity]] of [[aquifer]]s is often anisotropic for the same reason. When calculating groundwater flow to [[drainage|drains]]&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Oosterbaan, 1997, The energy balance of groundwater flow applied to subsurface drainage in anisotropic soils by pipes or ditches with entrance resistance. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/enerart.pdf]. The corresponding free EnDrain program can be downloaded from: [http://www.waterlog.info/endrain.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; or to [[Water well|wells]],&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Oosterbaan, 2002, Subsurface drainage by (tube)wells, 9 pp. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/wellspac.pdf]. The corresponding free WellDrain program can be downloaded from: [http://www.waterlog.info/weldrain.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; the difference between horizontal and vertical permeability is to be taken into account otherwise the results may be subject to error.

Most common rock-forming [[mineral]]s are anisotropic, including [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]]. Anisotropy in minerals is most reliably seen in their [[optical mineralogy|optical properties]]. An example of an isotropic mineral is [[garnet]].

===Medical acoustics===
Anisotropy is also a well-known property in medical ultrasound imaging describing a different resulting [[echogenicity]] of soft tissues, such as tendons, when the angle of the transducer is changed. Tendon fibers appear hyperechoic (bright) when the transducer is perpendicular to the tendon, but can appear hypoechoic (darker) when the transducer is angled obliquely. This can be a source of interpretation error for inexperienced practitioners. In [[diffusion tensor imaging]], anisotropy alterations may reflect diffusion changes of water in the brain, particularly in the [[white matter]].

===Material science and engineering===
Anisotropy, in Material Science, is a material’s directional dependence of a physical property. Most materials exhibit anisotropic behavior. An example would be the dependence of [[Young's modulus]] on the direction of load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |last = Kocks
  |first = U.F.
  |title = Texture and Anisotropy: Preferred Orientations in Polycrystals and their effect on Materials Properties
  |publisher = [[Cambridge]]
  |year = 2000
  |isbn = 9780521794206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Anisotropy in polycrystalline materials can also be due to certain [[Texture (crystalline)|texture]] patterns which are often produced during manufacturing of the material.  In the case of rolling, &quot;stringers&quot; of texture are produced in the direction of rolling, which can lead to vastly different properties in the rolling and transverse directions.
Some materials, such as wood and fibre-reinforced [[composite material|composites]] are very anisotropic, being much stronger along the grain/fibre than across it. Metals and alloys tend to be more isotropic, though they can sometimes exhibit significant anisotropic behaviour. This is especially important in processes such as [[Stamping (metalworking)|deep-drawing]]. 

Wood is a naturally anisotropic material.  Its properties vary widely when measured with the growth grain or against it.  For example, wood's strength and hardness will be different for the same sample if measured in differing orientation.

===Microfabrication===

Anisotropic etching techniques (such as [[deep reactive ion etching]]) are used in microfabrication processes to create well defined microscopic features with a high [[aspect ratio]].  These features are commonly used in [[microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] and [[microfluidic]] devices, where the anisotropy of the features is needed to impart desired optical, electrical, or physical properties to the device. Anisotropic etching could also refer to certain chemical etchants which are etching a certain material preferentially over certain crystallographic planes (e.g., KOH etching of [[silicon]] [100] produces pyramid-like structures)

===Neuroscience===

[[Diffusion tensor imaging]] is an [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] technique that involves measuring the fractional anisotropy of the random motion ([[Brownian motion]]) of water molecules in the brain.  Water molecules located in [[White matter|fiber tracts]] are more likely to be anisotropic, since they are restricted in their movement (they move more in the dimension parallel to the fiber tract rather than in the two dimensions orthogonal to it), whereas water molecules dispersed in the rest of the brain have less restricted movement and therefore display more isotropy.  This difference in fractional anisotropy is exploited to create a map of the fiber tracts in the brains of the individual.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{Nuclear physics}} [[Image:Alpha Decay.svg|thumb|left|Alpha decay]]'''Alpha decay''' is a type of [[radioactivity|radioactive decay]] in which an [[atomic nucleus]] emits an [[alpha particle]] and thereby transforms (or 'decays') into an atom with a [[mass number]] 4 less and [[atomic number]] 2 less. For example:
{|
|-
|{{Nuclide2|link=yes|uranium|238}}&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||{{Nuclide2|link=yes|thorium|234}}&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||{{Nuclide2|link=yes|helium|4|charge=2+}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=&quot;suchocki&quot;&gt;Suchocki, John. ''Conceptual Chemistry'', 2007. Page 119.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

which can also be written as:
{|
|-
|{{SimpleNuclide|Link|uranium|238}}&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;{{SimpleNuclide|Link|thorium|234}}&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|Link=yes|Alpha}}||&amp;nbsp;||
|}

An [[alpha particle]] is the same as a [[helium-4]] [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]], and both [[mass number]] and [[atomic number]] are the same.

Alpha  decay is by far the most common form of [[cluster decay]] where the parent [[atom]] ejects a defined [[decay product|daughter]] collection of [[nucleon]]s, leaving another defined product behind (in [[nuclear fission]], a number of different pairs of daughters of approximately equal size are formed). Alpha decay is the most likely cluster decay because of the combined extremely high [[binding energy]] and relatively small mass of the helium-4 product nucleus (the alpha particle). 

Alpha decay, like other cluster decays, is fundamentally a [[quantum tunneling]] process. Unlike [[beta decay]], alpha decay is governed by the interplay between the [[nuclear force]] and the [[electromagnetic force]].

Alpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides. In theory it can occur only in nuclei somewhat heavier than nickel (element 28), where overall [[binding energy]] per nucleon is no longer a minimum, and the nuclides are therefore unstable toward spontaneous fission-type processes. In practice, this mode of decay has only been observed in nuclides considerably heavier than nickel, with the lightest known alpha emitter being the lightest [[isotope]]s (mass numbers 106–110) of [[tellurium]] (element 52). 

[[Alpha particles]] have a typical kinetic energy of 5&amp;nbsp;MeV (that is, ≈&amp;nbsp;0.13% of their total energy, i.e. 110&amp;nbsp;TJ/kg) and a speed of 15,000&amp;nbsp;km/s. This corresponds to a speed of around 0.05&amp;nbsp;''[[Speed of light|c]]''. There is surprisingly small variation around this energy, due to the heavy dependence of the half-life of this process on the energy produced (see equations in the [[Geiger–Nuttall law]]).

Because of their relatively large mass, +2 [[electric charge]] and relatively low velocity, alpha particles are very likely to interact with other atoms and lose their energy, so their forward motion is effectively stopped within a few centimeters of [[air]].
[[Image:Alphaspektroskopie.JPG|thumb|right|Alpha source beneath a radiation detector]]

Most of the [[helium]] produced on [[Earth]] (approximately 99% of it) is the result of the alpha decay of underground deposits of [[minerals]] containing [[uranium]] or [[thorium]]. The helium is brought to the surface as a byproduct of [[natural gas]] production.

==History==
Alpha particles were first described in the investigations of radioactivity by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1899, and by 1907 they were identified as He&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. For more details of this early work, see [[Alpha particle#History of discovery and use]].

By 1928, [[George Gamow]] had solved the theory of the alpha decay via tunneling. The alpha particle is trapped in a [[potential well]] by the nucleus. Classically, it is forbidden to escape, but according to the then newly discovered principles of [[quantum mechanics]], it has a tiny (but non-zero) probability of &quot;[[quantum tunnelling|tunneling]]&quot; through the [[potential barrier|barrier]] and appearing on the other side to escape the nucleus. Gamow solved a model potential for the nucleus and derived from first principles a relationship between the [[half-life]] of the decay, and the energy of the emission, which had been previously discovered empirically, and was known as the [[Geiger–Nuttall law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phy.uct.ac.za/courses/phy300w/np/ch1/node38.html For Gamow's derivation of this law, see]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[Americium-241]], an [[alpha emitter]], is used in [[smoke detector]]s. The alpha particles [[Ionization|ionize]] air between a small gap. A small [[Electric current|current]] is passed through that ionized air. Smoke particles from fire that enter the air gap reduce the current flow, sounding the alarm.

Alpha decay can provide a safe power source for [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s used for [[space probe]]s and [[Artificial pacemaker|artificial heart pacemakers]]. Alpha decay is much more easily shielded against than other forms of radioactive decay. [[Plutonium-238]], for example, requires only 2.5&amp;nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]] of [[lead]] shielding to protect against unwanted radiation.

[[Static eliminator]]s typically use [[polonium-210]], an alpha emitter, to ionize air, allowing the 'static cling' to more rapidly dissipate.

==Toxicity==
Being relatively heavy and positively charged, alpha particles tend to have a very short [[mean free path]], and quickly lose kinetic energy within a short distance of their source. This results in several [[MeV]] being deposited in a relatively small volume of material. This increases the chance of cellular damage in cases of internal contamination. In general, external alpha radiation is not harmful since alpha particles are effectively shielded by a few centimeters of air, a piece of paper, or the thin layer of dead [[skin cell]]s. Even touching an alpha source is usually not harmful, though many alpha sources also are accompanied by [[beta decay|beta-emitting]] radio daughters, and alpha emission is also accompanied by gamma photon emission. If substances emitting alpha particles are ingested, inhaled, injected or introduced through the skin, then it could result in a measurable [[Equivalent dose|dose]].

The [[relative biological effectiveness]] (RBE) of alpha radiation is higher than that of beta or gamma radiation. RBE quantifies the ability of radiation to cause certain biological effects, notably either [[cancer]] or [[necrosis|cell-death]], for equivalent radiation exposure. The higher value for alpha radiation is generally attributable to the high [[linear energy transfer]] (LET), which is about one ionization of a chemical bond for every [[Ångström]] of travel by the alpha particle. The RBE has been set at the value of 20 for alpha radiation by various government regulations. The RBE is set at 10 for [[neutron]] irradiation, and at 1 for [[Beta decay|beta radiation]] and ionizing photons.

However, another component of alpha radiation is the [[recoil]] of the parent nucleus, termed alpha recoil. Due to the [[conservation of momentum]] requiring the parent nucleus to recoil, the effect acts much like the 'kick' of a rifle butt when a bullet goes in the opposite direction. This gives a significant amount of energy to the recoiling nucleus, which also causes [[ionization damage]]. The total energy of the recoil nucleus is readily calculable, and is roughly the weight of the alpha (4&amp;nbsp;[[Atomic mass unit|u]]) divided by the weight of the parent (typically about 200&amp;nbsp;u) times the total energy of the alpha. By some estimates, this might account for most of the internal radiation damage, as the recoil nuclei are typically [[heavy metals]] which preferentially collect on the [[chromosomes]]. In some studies,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; this has resulted in a RBE approaching 1,000 instead of the value used in governmental regulations.

The largest natural contributor to public radiation dose is [[radon]], a naturally occurring, radioactive gas found in soil and rock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ans.org/pi/resources/dosechart/ ANS : Public Information : Resources : Radiation Dose Chart&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; If the gas is inhaled, some of the radon particles may attach to the inner lining of the lung. These particles continue to decay, emitting alpha particles which can damage cells in the lung tissue.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Radiation Information: Radon. October 6, 2006, [http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/radon.htm], Accessed December 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The death of [[Marie Curie]] at age 66 from [[leukemia]] was probably caused by prolonged exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, but it is not clear if this was due to alpha radiation or X-rays. Curie worked extensively with radium, which decays into radon,&lt;ref&gt;Health Physics Society, &quot;Did Marie Curie die of a radiation overexposure?&quot; [http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q535.html]&lt;/ref&gt; along with other radioactive materials that emit [[beta decay|beta]] and [[gamma ray]]s. However, Curie also worked with unshielded X-ray tubes during World War I, and analysis of her skeleton during a reburial showed a relatively low level of radioisotope burden.

Russian dissident [[Alexander Litvinenko]]'s 2006 murder by [[radiation poisoning]] is thought to have been carried out with [[polonium-210]], an alpha emitter.

In 1996, the following definition taken from [[Joseph Wresinski]], founder of [[ATD Fourth World]] was taken up by the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in [[s:The Despouy Report on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;The lack of basic security connotes the absence of one or more factors enabling individuals and families to assume basic responsibilities and to enjoy fundamental rights. The situation may become widespread and result in more serious and permanent consequences. The lack of basic security leads to chronic poverty when it simultaneously affects several aspects of people’s lives, when it is prolonged and when it severely compromises people’s chances of regaining their rights and of reassuming their responsibilities in the foreseeable future.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;(E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/13)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2005 the World Bank defined extreme poverty as living on less than US$1.25 a day. This meant living on the equivalent of US$1.25 a day, in the US, buying US goods. In 2011, this means surviving on the equivalent to US$1.50, AUD$2 or 1 pound per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia: Live Below the Line&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_below_the_line}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The eradication of extreme poverty and [[hunger]] was the first [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal]], as set by 179 [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Member States|Member States]] in 2000. Economists and activists consider epidemic diseases ([[AIDS]], [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]]) as crucial factors in and consequences of extreme poverty.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Extreme poverty is most common in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[South Asia]].

(Trial model)''] -Science Museum, London&lt;/ref&gt; as displayed at the Science Museum (London)]]
{{history of computing}}
The '''Analytical Engine''', an important step in the [[history of computers]], is a design for a mechanical general-purpose [[computer]] first described by [[English people|English]] mathematician [[Charles Babbage]] in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/10/the-100-year-leap.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the successor to Babbage's [[difference engine]], a design for a mechanical calculator.  The Analytical Engine incorporated an [[Arithmetic logic unit|arithmetical unit]], [[control flow]] in the form of [[conditional branching]] and [[Program_loop#Loops|loops]], and integrated [[computer memory|memory]], making it the first [[Turing complete|Turing-complete]] design for a general-purpose computer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/babbage.aspx?page=5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827915.500-lets-build-babbages-ultimate-mechanical-computer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage was never able to complete construction of any of his machines due to conflicts with his chief engineer and inadequate funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;meccano&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nineteenth_century_science&quot;&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=m4SB4BHzFeIC&amp;pg=PA84&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until 100&amp;nbsp;years later, in the 1940s, that [[History_of_computing_hardware#Electronic_digital_computation|the first general-purpose computers]] were actually built.

==Design==
[[File:PunchedCardsAnalyticalEngine.jpg|thumb|right|Two types of [[punched cards]] used to program the machine. Foreground: &quot;operational cards&quot;, for inputting [[instruction set|instructions]]; background: &quot;variable cards&quot;, for inputting [[data (computing)|data]].]]
Babbage's first attempt at a mechanical computing device, the [[difference engine]], was a special-purpose calculator designed to tabulate [[logarithm]]s and [[trigonometric function]]s by evaluating finite differences to create approximating [[polynomial]]s. Construction of this machine was never completed; Babbage had conflicts with his chief engineer, [[Joseph Clement]], and ultimately the British government withdrew its funding for the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=ocx4Jc12mkgC&amp;pg=PA176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=uw9UqlkPvMkC&amp;pg=PA105&lt;/ref&gt;

During this project he realized that a much more general design, the Analytical Engine, was possible. The input (programs and data) was to be provided to the machine via [[punched card]]s, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical [[loom]]s such as the [[Jacquard loom]]. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. It employed ordinary [[base-10]] fixed-point arithmetic.

There was to be a store (that is, a memory) capable of holding 1,000 numbers of 50 decimal digits each (ca. 20.7 kB). An [[Arithmetic logic unit|arithmetical unit]] (the &quot;mill&quot;) would be able to perform all four [[arithmetic operations]], plus comparisons and optionally [[square root]]s. Initially it was conceived as a [[difference engine]] curved back upon itself, in a generally circular layout,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cse.stanford.edu/classes/sophomore-college/projects-98/babbage/ana-mech.htm ''Babbage’s Analytical Engine: The First True Digital Computer'']&lt;/ref&gt; with the long store exiting off to one side. (Later drawings depict a regularized grid layout.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projects.ex.ac.uk/babbage/engines.html ''Calculating Engines''] - The Babbage Pages&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) in a modern computer, the mill would rely upon its own internal procedures, to be stored in the form of pegs inserted into rotating drums called &quot;barrels&quot;, to carry out some of the more complex instructions the user's program might specify.&lt;ref name=&quot;meccano&quot;&gt;[http://www.meccano.us/analytical_engine/index.html ''Difference Engines''] - Tim Robinson's ''Meccano'' Computing Machinery web site&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[microcode]] for the modern equivalent.)

The programming language to be employed by users was akin to modern day [[assembly language]]s. Loops and conditional branching were possible, and so the language as conceived would have been [[Turing-complete]] long before [[Alan Turing]]'s concept. Three different types of punch cards were used: one for arithmetical operations, one for numerical constants, and one for load and store operations, transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back. There were three separate readers for the three types of cards.

In 1842, the Italian mathematician [[Luigi Menabrea]], whom Babbage had met while travelling in Italy, wrote a description of the engine in French. In 1843, the description was translated into English and extensively annotated by [[Ada Lovelace|Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace]], who had become interested in the engine ten years earlier. In recognition of her additions to Menabrea's paper, which included a way to calculate [[Bernoulli numbers]] using the machine, she has been described as the first computer [[programmer]]. The modern computer programming language [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] is named in her honour.

==Construction==
Late in his life, Babbage sought ways to build a simplified version of the machine, and assembled a small part of it before his death in 1871.&lt;ref name=&quot;meccano&quot; /&gt;  But in 1878, a committee of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] recommended against constructing the Analytical Engine, which sank Babbage's efforts for government funding.{{Clarifyme|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- dates wrong? How could Babbage make efforts 17&amp;nbsp;years after his death? --&gt;

In 1910, Babbage's son Henry Prevost Babbage reported that a part of the mill and the printing apparatus had been constructed and had been used to calculate a (faulty) list of multiples of [[pi]]. This constituted only a small part of the whole engine; it was not programmable and had no storage.  (Popular images of this section have sometimes been mislabelled, implying that it was the entire mill or even the entire engine.)  Henry Babbage's &quot;Analytical Engine Mill&quot; is on display at the Science Museum in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;mill&quot;&gt;[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/computing_and_data_processing/1896-58.aspx ''Henry Babbage's Analytical Engine Mill, 1910''] Science Museum, London&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Analytical Engine (2290032530).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Henry Babbage's Analytical Engine Mill, built in 1910,&lt;ref name=&quot;mill&quot; /&gt; in the [[Science Museum (London)]]]]

Henry also proposed building a demonstration version of the full engine, with a smaller storage capacity: &quot;perhaps for a first machine ten (columns) would do, with fifteen wheels in each&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fourmilab&quot;&gt;[http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/hpb.html ''The Analytical engine''] By Major-General H. P. Babbage - From the Proceedings of the British Association, 1888;
Paper read at Bath, September 12, 1888&lt;/ref&gt; Such a version could manipulate 20&amp;nbsp;numbers of 25&amp;nbsp;digits each, and what it could be told to do with those numbers could still be impressive.  &quot;It is only a question of cards and time,&quot; wrote Henry Babbage in 1888, &quot;... and there is no reason why (twenty thousand) cards should not be used if necessary, in an Analytical Engine for the purposes of the mathematician.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fourmilab&quot; /&gt;

In 1991, the [[London Science Museum]] built a complete and working specimen of Babbage's Difference Engine No. 2, a design that incorporated refinements Babbage discovered during the development of the Analytical Engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/babbage.aspx?page=4 Disagreeable Babbage] &quot;Difference Engine No. 2 was the first full sized Babbage calculating engine to be completed. It was made as a research machine for display at the 1991 exhibition...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This machine was built using materials and [[engineering tolerance]]s that would have been available to Babbage, quelling the suggestion that Babbage's designs could not have been produced using the manufacturing technology of his time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/modernsequel/&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish engineers [[Per Georg Scheutz|Georg and Edvard Scheutz]] had made a working version of the difference engine in 1853, although on a different scale &amp;ndash; table-sized instead of room-sized.&lt;ref name=&quot;nineteenth_century_science&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Babbage, Charles.&quot; Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. 2008. Retrieved January 30, 2011 from Encyclopedia.com: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830905456.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, [[John Graham-Cumming]] started a campaign to raise funds by &quot;public subscription&quot; to enable serious historical and academic study of Babbage's plans, with a view to then build and test a fully working virtual design which will then in turn enable construction of the physical Analytical Engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11530905 | work=BBC News | title=Campaign builds to construct Babbage Analytical Engine | date=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plan28.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

===Predicted influence===
Babbage understood that the existence of an automatic computer would kindle interest in the field now known as [[algorithmic efficiency]], writing in his ''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher'', &quot;As soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide the future course of the science.  Whenever any result is sought by its aid, the question will then arise—By what course of calculation can these results be arrived at by the machine in the ''shortest time''?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Passages from the Life of a Philosopher | chapter=VIII | year=1864 | last=Babbage | first=Charles | url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/lpae.html | accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer science===
From 1872 Henry continued diligently with his father's work and then intermittently in retirement in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=The Babbage Engine - Key People - Henry Provost Babbage | publisher=Computer History Museum | url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/henrybabbage/ | accessdate=2011-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Percy Ludgate]] wrote about the engine in 1915 and even designed his own Analytical Engine (it was drawn up in detail but never built). Ludgate's engine would be much smaller than Babbage's of about 8 cubic feet (230 L) and hypothetically would be capable of multiplying two 20-decimal-digit numbers in about six seconds.

Despite this, Babbage's work fell into historical obscurity and the Analytical Engine was unknown to builders of electro-mechanical and electronic computing machines in the 1930s and 1940s when they began their work, resulting in the need to re-invent many of the architectural innovations Babbage had proposed.  [[Howard Aiken]], who built the quickly-obsoleted electromechanical calculator, the [[Harvard Mark I]], between 1937 and 1945, praised Babbage's work likely as a way of enhancing his own stature, but knew nothing of the Analytical Engine's architecture during the construction of the Mark I, and considered his visit to the constructed portion of the Analytical Engine &quot;the greatest disappointment of my life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=Howard Aiken: Portrait of a Computer Pioneer | first=Bernard | last=Cohen | chapter=8, &quot;Aiken's Background in Computing and Knowledge of Babbage's Machines&quot; | pages=61–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mark I showed no influence from the Analytical Engine and lacked the Analytical Engine's most prescient architectural feature, [[conditional branching]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen72&quot;&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=Ld7TgLeQXs4C&amp;pg=PA72&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Presper Eckert]] and [[John W. Mauchly]] similarly were not aware of the details of Babbage's Analytical Engine work prior to the completion of their design for the first electronic general-purpose computer, the [[ENIAC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.umn.edu/cbi/oh/pdf.phtml?id=245 Interview of Presper Eckert by Nancy Stern], October 28, 1977, Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, page 27.  &quot;To the best of my knowledge [the nested subroutine] was Mauchly's idea.  I don't know whether any of those ideas showed up earlier, because I was not familiar with Babbage's work.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://invention.smithsonian.org/downloads/fa_cohc_tr_mauc730223.pdf NBS Colloquium talk by John Mauchly], February 23, 1973, Ambler, Pennsylvania.  &quot;with this first electronic computer, the ENIAC, we solved the same problem [of the simultaneous carry that Babbage had solved]. It happens that the men who were building the ENIAC didn't know about Babbage. I can tell you that on a personal basis because I knew Mr. Eckert and my name is Mauchly and it just so happened that - yes, I'd heard of Babbage but of course I'd also heard at the same time that he was interested in some kind of mechanical calculators back in the previous century, so it never occurred to me that we should even look up a single reference on Babbage at that time. We knew how we were going to build an electronic calculator. What in the world profit could we get from looking up these old references on the last century? So we went busily ahead getting an ENIAC, only to find out when we got through that Babbage wasn't exactly out of touch with what we were trying to do next - namely, an EDSAC. But that's the kind of history that has a chance of repeating too, and the same thing happened to Aiken...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiction===
*The [[cyberpunk]] novelists [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]] co-authored a [[steampunk]] novel of [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternative history]] titled ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' in which Babbage's Difference and Analytical Engines became available to Victorian society. The novel explores the consequences and implications of the early introduction of computational technology.

*There is also mention of the Analytical Engine (or the Clockwork Ouroboros as it is also known there) in ''[[The Book of the War]]'', a [[Faction Paradox]] anthology edited by [[Lawrence Miles]]. This machine was used to calculate a way into the &quot;Eleven Day Empire&quot;. Its use resulted in the destruction of the original [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]].

*In the novel [[Perdido Street Station]], by British author [[China Miéville]], analytical engines similar to Babbage's serve as &quot;brains&quot; for the robotic constructs of the city of New Crobuzon.  One such engine even develops sentient thought due to a recursive algorithmic loop.

*The [[British Empire]] of ''[[The Peshawar Lancers]]'' by [[S. M. Stirling]] features a massive water powered engine at [[Srinagar|Oxford]], used by two of the main characters.  It is noted that most of the engines run on steam, and that an even larger one is under construction at the British Capital in [[Delhi]].

*In the [[Michael Flynn (author)|Michael Flynn]] novel ''[[In the Country of the Blind]]'', a secret society calling itself the Babbage Society secretly financed the building of Babbage Engines in the mid-19th century. In the novel, the Society uses the Babbage engines along with a statistical science called Cliology to predict and manipulate future history. In the process, they predict the rise of the Nazis and accidentally start the US Civil War.

*In the [[Neal Stephenson]] novel ''[[The Diamond Age]]'', ubiquitous molecular nanotechology is described to make use of &quot;rod logic&quot; similar to that imagined by Babbage's design for the Analytical Engine.

*''[http://www.cheznims.com/moriarty.htm Moriarty by Modem]'', a short story by Jack Nimersheim, describes an alternate history where Babbage's Analytical Engine was indeed completed and had been deemed highly classified by the British government.  The characters of [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]] had in reality been a set of prototype programs written for the Analytical Engine.  This short story follows Holmes as his program is rebooted on modern computers and he is forced to compete against his nemesis yet again in the modern counterparts of Babbage's Analytical Engine.

*A similar setting is used by [[Sydney Padua]] in the webcomic ''The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2dgoggles.com/ The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=blog&amp;id=58111 Experiments in Comics with Sydney Padua]&lt;/ref&gt; It features a [[pocket universe]] where Ada Lovelace and Babbage have built the Analytical Engine and use it to fight crime by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/category/the-client/ Babbage and Lovelace Vs The Client]&lt;/ref&gt; The comic is based on thorough research on the biographies and correspondence between Babbage and Lovelace, which is then twisted for humorous effect.

*[[Georgia on My Mind (novelette)|Georgia on My Mind]] is a [[novelette]] by [[Charles Sheffield]] which involves two major themes: being widowed and the quest for a legendary [[Charles Babbage|Babbage]] computer. 

*[[Hugh Cook (science fiction author)|Hugh Cook]]'s fantasy novels ''[[Chronicles_of_an_Age_of_Darkness#The_Wishstone_and_the_Wonderworkers|The Wishstone and the Wonderworkers]]'' and ''[[Chronicles_of_an_Age_of_Darkness#The_Wazir_and_the_Witch|The Wazir and the Witch]]'' feature an Analytical Engine created by the scientist [[Ivan Pokrov]]. It is used to calculate income tax.

==Comparison to other early computers==
If the Analytical Engine had been built, it would have been in many ways more advanced than some of the first computers that emerged in the 1940s. It would have been [[digital]], [[Computer program|programmable]] and [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]].  However, it would have been very slow. [[Ada Lovelace]] reported in her notes on the Analytical Engine: &quot;Mr. Babbage believes he can, by his engine, form the product of two numbers, each containing twenty figures, in three minutes&quot;.  By comparison the [[Harvard Mark I]] could perform the same task in just six seconds.  A modern PC can do the same thing in well under a millionth of a second.

{{lang-la|Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus}};&lt;ref&gt;In [[Classical Latin]], Augustus' name would be inscribed as &lt;small&gt;GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR AVGVSTVS&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
23 September 63&amp;nbsp;BC – 19 August AD 14) is considered the first emperor of the [[Roman Empire]], which he ruled alone from 27&amp;nbsp;BC until his death in AD 14.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The dates of his rule are contemporary dates; Augustus lived under two calendars, the Roman Republican until 45&amp;nbsp;BC, and the Julian after 45&amp;nbsp;BC. Due to departures from Julius Caesar's intentions, Augustus restored the Julian calendar in 8&amp;nbsp;BC, and the correspondence between the [[proleptic Julian calendar]] and the actual calendar observed in Rome is uncertain before 8&amp;nbsp;BC.(Blackburn &amp; Holford-Strevens 2003: 670–1)&lt;/ref&gt; Born '''Gaius Octavius Thurinus''', he was [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] [[wikt:posthumous|posthumously]] by his great-uncle [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]] in 44&amp;nbsp;BC via his last will and testament, and between then and 27&amp;nbsp;BC was officially named '''Gaius Julius Caesar'''. In 27&amp;nbsp;BC the Senate awarded him the honorific [[Augustus (honorific)|''Augustus'']] (&quot;the revered one&quot;), and thus consequently he was '''Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus'''.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Formally ''[[Imperator]] [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]], Divi filius, [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' which means ''Imperator Caesar, Son of the [[Divus]] ([[Julius Caesar|Divus Julius]]), Augustus.''&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the various names he bore, it is common to call him '''Octavius''' when referring to events between 63 and 44&amp;nbsp;BC, '''Octavian''' (or ''Octavianus'') when referring to events between 44 and 27&amp;nbsp;BC, and '''Augustus''' when referring to events after 27&amp;nbsp;BC. In Greek sources, Augustus is known as '''{{Polytonic|Ὀκτάβιος}}''' (''Octavius''), '''{{Polytonic|Καῖσαρ}}''' (''Caesar''), '''{{Polytonic|Αὔγουστος}}''' (''Augustus''), or '''Σεβαστός''' (''[[Sebastos]]''), depending on context.

The young Octavius came into his inheritance after Caesar's assassination in 44&amp;nbsp;BC. In 43&amp;nbsp;BC, Octavian joined forces with [[Mark Antony]] and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] in a [[military dictatorship]] known as the [[Second Triumvirate]]. As a [[triumvir]], Octavian ruled Rome and many of its provinces.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Some provinces were governed by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].&lt;/ref&gt; The triumvirate was eventually torn apart under the competing ambitions of its rulers: Lepidus was driven into exile, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the [[Battle of Actium]] by the fleet of Octavian commanded by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] in 31&amp;nbsp;BC.

After the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Octavian restored the outward facade of the [[Roman Republic]], with governmental power vested in the [[Roman Senate]], but in practice retained his autocratic power. It took several years to determine the exact framework by which a formally republican state could be led by a sole ruler; the result became known as the [[Roman Empire]]. The emperorship was never an office like the [[Roman dictator]]ship which Caesar and [[Sulla]] had held before him; indeed, he declined it when the Roman populace &quot;entreated him to take on the dictatorship&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 35&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including those of [[tribune]] of the plebs and [[Roman censor|censor]]. He was [[Roman consul|consul]] until 23&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dio (1987), 153.&lt;/ref&gt; His substantive power stemmed from financial success and resources gained in conquest, the building of patronage relationships throughout the Empire, the loyalty of many military soldiers and veterans, the authority of the many honors granted by the Senate,&lt;ref name = &quot;eck 3&quot;/&gt; and the respect of the people. Augustus' control over the majority of Rome's [[Roman army|legions]] established an armed threat that could be used against the Senate, allowing him to coerce the Senate's decisions. With his ability to eliminate senatorial opposition by means of arms, the Senate became docile towards him. His rule through patronage, military power, and accumulation of the offices of the defunct Republic became the model for all later imperial governments.

The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the ''[[Pax Romana]]'', or ''Roman peace''. Despite continuous wars on the frontiers, and one [[Year of Four Emperors|year-long civil war]] over the imperial succession, the Mediterranean world remained at peace for more than two centuries. Augustus enlarged the empire dramatically, annexing [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Pannonia]], and [[Raetia]], expanded possessions in [[Africa Province|Africa]], and completed the conquest of [[Hispania]]. Beyond the frontiers, he secured the empire with [[client state]]s, and made peace with [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]] through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed [[Roman roads|networks of roads]] with an official [[courier]] system, established a standing army, established the [[Praetorian Guard]], and created official police and fire-fighting services for Rome. Much of the city was rebuilt under Augustus; and he wrote a record of his own accomplishments, known as the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', which has survived. Upon his death in AD 14, Augustus was declared a god by the Senate—to be worshipped by the Romans.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 124&quot;/&gt; His names Augustus and Caesar were adopted by every subsequent emperor, and the month of Sextilis was renamed 'Augustus' (now August) in honour of his memory. He was succeeded by his adopted son (also stepson and former son-in-law), [[Tiberius]].

==Early life==
{{Main|Early life of Augustus}}
While his paternal family was from the town of [[Velitrae]], about 25&amp;nbsp;miles from Rome, Augustus was born in the city of Rome on 23 September 63&amp;nbsp;BC. He was born at Ox Head, a small property on the [[Palatine Hill]], very close to the [[Roman Forum]]. He was given the name '''Gaius Octavius Thurinus''', his [[cognomen]] possibly commemorating his father's victory at [[Thurii]] over a rebellious band of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#7 7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#5 5–6 on-line text].&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the crowded nature of Rome at the time, Octavius was taken to his father's home village at [[Velitrae]] to be raised. Octavius only mentions his father's [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family briefly in his memoirs. His paternal great-grandfather was a military tribune in [[Sicily]] during the [[Second Punic War]]. His grandfather had served in several local political offices. [[Gaius Octavius|His father, also named Gaius Octavius]], had been governor of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' The &quot;Marcus Octavius&quot; [[veto]]ing the [[agrarian law]] suggested by [[Tiberius Gracchus]] in 133&amp;nbsp;BC was possibly his ancestor. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#1 1–4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 14&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother [[Atia Balba Caesonia|Atia]] was the niece of [[Julius Caesar]].

In 59&amp;nbsp;BC, when he was four years old, his father died.&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 23&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother married a former governor of Syria, [[Lucius Marcius Philippus]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#4 4–8]; [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], ''[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/nicolaus.html Augustus]'' 3. {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5Qbrv42Mg|date =2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philippus claimed descent from [[Alexander the Great]], and was elected [[Roman consul|consul]] in 56&amp;nbsp;BC. Philippus never had much of an interest in young Octavius. Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother (and Julius Caesar's sister), [[Julia Caesaris (sister of Julius Caesar)|Julia Caesaris]].

In 52 or 51&amp;nbsp;BC, Julia Caesaris died. Octavius delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#8 8.1]; [[Quintilian]], [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/quintilian/quintilian.institutio12.shtml#6 12.6.1].&lt;/ref&gt; From this point, his mother and stepfather took a more active role in raising him. He donned the ''[[toga virilis]]'' four years later,&lt;ref name=Suet8.1&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#8 8.1]&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected to the [[College of Pontiffs]] in 47&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaus of Damascus, [http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/nicolaus.html ''Augustus''] 4. {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5Qbrv42Mg|date =2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 16&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he was put in charge of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Greek games]] that were staged in honor of the [[Temple of Venus Genetrix]], built by Julius Caesar.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 16&quot;/&gt; According to [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], Octavius wished to join Caesar's staff for his campaign in [[Africa (province)|Africa]] but gave way when his mother protested.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaus of Damascus, ''[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/nicolaus.html Augustus]'' 6. {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5Qbrv42Mg|date =2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 46&amp;nbsp;BC, she consented for him to join Caesar in [[Hispania]], where he planned to fight the forces of [[Pompey]], Caesar's late enemy, but Octavius fell ill and was unable to travel.

When he had recovered, he sailed to the front, but was shipwrecked; after coming ashore with a handful of companions, he crossed hostile territory to Caesar's camp, which impressed his great-uncle considerably.&lt;ref name=Suet8.1/&gt; [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus|Velleius Paterculus]] reports that Caesar afterwards allowed the young man to share his carriage.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2C*.html#59.3 2.59.3].&lt;/ref&gt; When back in Rome, Caesar deposited a new will with the [[Vestal Virgins]], naming Octavius as the prime beneficiary.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#83 83].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to power==
===Heir to Caesar===
[[File:Gerome Death of Caesar.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Death of Caesar'', by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1867). On 15 March 44&amp;nbsp;BC, Octavius's adoptive father Julius Caesar was assassinated by a conspiracy led by [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]].]]

At the time [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar was killed]] on the [[Ides of March]] (the 15th) 44&amp;nbsp;BC, Octavius was studying and undergoing military training in [[Apollonia, Illyria]]. Rejecting the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], he sailed to [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]] to ascertain if he had any potential political fortunes or security.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 9&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; After landing at Lupiae near [[Brundisium]], he learned the contents of Caesar's will, and only then did he decide to become Caesar's political heir as well as heir to two-thirds of his estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 16&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/3*.html#9 3.9–11].&lt;/ref&gt; Having no living legitimate children,&lt;ref&gt;His daughter [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|Julia]] had died in 54&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar had adopted his great-nephew Octavius as his son and main heir.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 15&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his [[adoption in Rome|adoption]], Octavius assumed his great-uncle's name, '''Gaius Julius Caesar'''. Although Romans who had been adopted into a new family usually retained their old [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] in [[cognomen]] form (e.g. ''Octavianus'' for one who had been an Octavius, ''Aemilianus'' for one who had been an Aemilius, etc.) there is no evidence that he ever bore the name ''Octavianus'', as it would have made his modest origins too obvious.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay (2004), 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 10&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern, ''Augustus'' pp.20–21&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the fact that he never officially bore the name ''Octavianus'', to save confusing the dead dictator with his heir, historians often refer to the new Caesar—between his adoption and his assumption, in 27&amp;nbsp;BC, of the name Augustus—as ''Octavian''.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, ''Augustus'' pp.21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Antony]] later charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours, though [[Suetonius]], in his work ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', describes Antony's accusation as political slander.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#68 68], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#71 71].&lt;/ref&gt;

To make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy, Octavian could not rely on his limited funds.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 9 10&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; After a warm welcome by Caesar's soldiers at Brundisium,&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 19&quot;/&gt; Octavian demanded a portion of the funds that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against [[Parthia]] in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 9 10&quot;/&gt; This amounted to 700 million [[sestertius|sesterces]] stored at Brundisium, the staging ground in Italy for military operations in the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 18&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; A later senatorial investigation into the disappearance of the public funds made no action against Octavian, since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senate's arch enemy, Mark Antony.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 19&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian made another bold move in 44&amp;nbsp;BC when without official permission he appropriated the annual tribute that had been sent from Rome's [[Near East]]ern province&lt;!--[[Asia (Roman province)]]?--&gt; to Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 10&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 18&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian began to bolster his personal forces with Caesar's veteran legionaries and with troops designated for the Parthian war, gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to Caesar.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/3*.html#11 3.11–12].&lt;/ref&gt; On his march to Rome through Italy, Octavian's presence and newly acquired funds attracted many, winning over Caesar's former veterans stationed in [[Campania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 10&quot;/&gt; By June he had gathered an army of 3,000 loyal veterans, paying each a salary of 500 [[denarius|denarii]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 24&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 27&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 20&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Augustus Statue.JPG|thumb|upright|A statue of Augustus as a younger Octavian, dated c. 30 BC]]

Arriving in Rome on 6 May 44&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 10&quot;/&gt; Octavian found the consul [[Mark Antony]], Caesar's former colleague, in an uneasy truce with the dictator's assassins; they had been granted a general amnesty on 17 March, yet Antony succeeded in driving most of them out of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 10&quot;/&gt; This was due to his &quot;inflammatory&quot; eulogy given at Caesar's funeral, mounting public opinion against the assassins.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 10&quot;/&gt; Although Mark Antony was amassing political support, Octavian still had opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Mark Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he at first opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 11&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesar's money to him. However, during the summer he managed to win support from Caesarian sympathizers, who saw the younger heir as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him, or to bear with him during their efforts to get rid of Antonius.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 114–120.&lt;/ref&gt; In September, the [[Optimates|Optimate]] orator [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] began to attack Antony in a [[Philippicae|series of speeches]] portraying Antony as the greatest threat to the order of the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 26&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 30&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; With opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of consular power nearing its end, Antony attempted to pass laws which would lend him control over [[Cisalpine Gaul]], which had been assigned as part of his province, from [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]], one of Caesar's assassins.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 11 12&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 21&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian meanwhile built up a private army in Italy by recruiting Caesarian veterans, and on 28 November won over two of Antony's legions with the enticing offer of monetary gain.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 123–126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 12&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 23&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of Octavian's large and capable force, Antony saw the danger of staying in Rome, and to the relief of the Senate he fled to Cisalpine Gaul, which was to be handed to him on 1 January.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 23&quot;/&gt;

===First conflict with Antony===
[[File:Bust of augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Augustus in [[Musei Capitolini]], Rome]]
After Decimus Brutus refused to give up [[Cisalpine Gaul]], Antony besieged him at [[Mutina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell, 24&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The resolutions passed by the Senate to stop the violence were rejected by Antony, as the Senate had no army of its own to challenge him; this provided an opportunity for Octavian, who was already known to have armed forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 12&quot;/&gt; Cicero also defended Octavian against Antony's taunts about Octavian's lack of noble lineage; he stated &quot;we have no more brilliant example of traditional piety among our youth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 29&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was in part a rebuttal to Antony's opinion of Octavian, as Cicero quoted Antony saying to Octavian, &quot;You, boy, owe everything to your name.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 30&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 19 20&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In this unlikely alliance orchestrated by the arch anti-Caesarian senator Cicero, the Senate inducted Octavian as senator on  1 January 43&amp;nbsp;BC, yet he was also given the power to vote alongside the former consuls.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 23&quot;/&gt; In addition, Octavian was granted ''[[imperium]]'' (commanding power), which made his command of troops legal, sending him to relieve the siege along with [[Aulus Hirtius|Hirtius]] and [[Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus|Pansa]] (the consuls for 43&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 167.&lt;/ref&gt; In April of 43&amp;nbsp;BC, Antony's forces were defeated at the battles of [[Battle of Forum Gallorum|Forum Gallorum]] and [[Battle of Mutina|Mutina]], forcing Antony to retreat to [[Transalpine Gaul]]. However, both consuls were killed, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 173–174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

After heaping many more rewards on Decimus Brutus than  Octavian for defeating Antony, the Senate attempted to give command of the consular legions to Decimus Brutus, yet Octavian decided not to cooperate.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 26 27&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Octavian stayed in the [[Po Valley]] and refused to aid any further offensive against Antony.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 27&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In July, an embassy of [[centurion]]s sent by Octavian entered Rome and demanded that he receive the consulship left vacant by Hirtius and Pansa.&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 32 33&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian also demanded that the decree declaring Antony a public enemy should be rescinded.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 27&quot;/&gt; When this was refused, he marched on the city with eight legions.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 27&quot;/&gt; He encountered no military opposition in Rome, and on  19 August 43&amp;nbsp;BC was elected consul with his relative [[Quintus Pedius]] as co-consul.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 14&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 28&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Antony formed an alliance with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], another leading Caesarian.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 176–186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a meeting near [[Bologna]] in October of 43&amp;nbsp;BC, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus formed a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] called the [[Second Triumvirate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 15&quot;/&gt; This explicit arrogation of special powers lasting five years was then supported by law passed by the [[plebs]], unlike the unofficial [[First Triumvirate]] formed by [[Gnaeus Pompey Magnus]], [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 15&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The triumvirs then set in motion [[proscription]]s in which allegedly 300 senators and 2,000 ''[[Equestrian (Roman)|equites]]'' were branded as [[outlaw]]s and deprived of their property and, for those who failed to escape, their lives.&lt;ref name = &quot;eck 16&quot;/&gt; The estimation that 300 senators were proscribed was presented by [[Appian]], although his earlier contemporary [[Livy]] asserted that only 130 senators had been proscribed.&lt;ref&gt;Southern (1998), 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; This decree issued by the triumvirate was motivated in part by a need to raise money to pay their troops' salaries for the upcoming conflict against Caesar's assassins, [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]].&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed, while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 16&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was more responsible for the proscriptions and killing. However, the sources agree that enacting the proscriptions was a means by all three factions to eliminate political enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19 20&quot;&gt;Scott (1933), 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]] asserted that Octavian tried to avoid proscribing officials whereas Lepidus and Antony were to blame for initiating them.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19&quot;/&gt; [[Cassius Dio]] defended Augustus as trying to spare as many as possible, whereas Antony and Lepidus, being older and involved in politics longer, had many more enemies to deal with.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19&quot;/&gt; This claim was rejected by Appian, who maintained that Octavian shared an equal interest with Lepidus and Antony in eradicating his enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 20&quot;&gt;Scott (1933), 20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suetonius]] presents the case that Octavian, although reluctant at first to proscribe officials, nonetheless pursued his enemies with more rigor than the other triumvirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19 20&quot;/&gt; [[Plutarch]] describes the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping of friends and family between Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian. For example, Octavian allowed the proscription of his ally [[Cicero]], Antony the proscription of his maternal uncle [[Lucius Julius Caesar IV]], and Lepidus his brother Paulus.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott 1933 19&quot;&gt;Scott (1933), 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Philippi and division of territory====
{{See|Liberators' civil war}}
On 1 January 42&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] posthumously recognized Julius Caesar as a divinity of the Roman state, ''[[Divus Iulius]]''. Octavian was able to further his cause by emphasizing the fact that he was ''[[Divi filius]]'', &quot;Son of God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Antony and Octavian then sent 28 [[Roman legions|legions]] by sea to face the armies of Brutus and Cassius, who had built their base of power in Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 17&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; After two [[Battle of Philippi|battles at Philippi]] in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] in October of 42, the Caesarian army was victorious and [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] committed [[suicide]]. Mark Antony would later use the examples of these battles as a means to belittle Octavian, as both battles were decisively won with the use of Antony's forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 17 18&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to claiming responsibility for both victories, Antony also branded Octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 17 18&quot;/&gt;

After Philippi, a new territorial arrangement was made among the members of the Second Triumvirate. While Antony placed [[Gaul]], the provinces of [[Hispania]], and [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]] in the hands of Octavian, Antony traveled east to [[Egypt]] where he allied himself with Queen [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra VII]], the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesar's infant son, [[Caesarion]]. Lepidus was left with the [[Africa Province|province of Africa]], stymied by Antony who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 18&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Octavian was left to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of thousands of veterans of the Macedonian campaign whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius, who could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, also required land.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 18&quot;/&gt; There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland; Octavian chose the former.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 18 19&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 19&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rebellion and marriage alliances====

Widespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over his soldiers' settlements encouraged many to rally at the side of [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]], who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 19&quot;/&gt;  Meanwhile, Octavian asked for a divorce from [[Clodia Pulchra]], the daughter of [[Fulvia]] and her first husband [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. Claiming that his marriage with Clodia had never been consummated, he returned her to her mother, Mark Antony's wife. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. However, Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian, since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 19&quot;/&gt; Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at [[Perusia]] (modern [[Perugia]]), where Octavian forced them into surrender in early 40&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 19&quot;/&gt; Lucius and his army were spared due to his kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to [[Sicyon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 32&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Octavian showed no mercy for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 20&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Perusia was also pillaged and burned as a warning for others.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 32&quot;/&gt; This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by many, such as the Augustan poet [[Sextus Propertius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 20&quot;/&gt;

[[Sextus Pompeius]], son of the First Triumvir [[Pompey]] and still a renegade general following Julius Caesar's victory over his father, was established in [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 162&lt;/ref&gt; Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius, who was ironically a member of the republican party, not the Caesarian faction.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 20&quot;/&gt; Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance when in 40&amp;nbsp;BC he married [[Scribonia]], a daughter of [[Lucius Scribonius Libo]] who was a follower of Pompeius as well as his father-in-law.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 20&quot;/&gt; Scribonia conceived Octavian's only natural child, [[Julia the Elder|Julia]], who was born the same day that he divorced Scribonia to marry [[Livia|Livia Drusilla]], little more than a year after his marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 20&quot;/&gt;

While in Egypt, Antony had been engaged in an affair with [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] and had fathered three children with her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Helios]], [[Cleopatra Selene II]] and [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]]&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian, Antony left Cleopatra; he sailed to Italy in 40&amp;nbsp;BC with a large force to oppose Octavian, laying siege to [[Brundisium]]. However, this new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony. Their [[centurion]]s, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their Caesarian cause, while the legions under their command followed suit.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 21&quot;&gt;Eck (2003) 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 19&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile in Sicyon, Antony's wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her. Fulvia's death and the mutiny of their centurions allowed the two remaining triumvirs to effect a reconciliation.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 21&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 19&quot;/&gt; In the autumn of 40, Octavian and Antony approved the Treaty of Brundisium, by which Lepidus would remain in Africa, Antony in the East, Octavian in the West. The Italian peninsula was left open to all for the recruitment of soldiers, but in reality, this provision was useless for Antony in the East.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 21&quot;/&gt; To further cement relations of alliance with Mark Antony, Octavian gave his sister, [[Octavia Minor]], in marriage to Antony in late 40&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 21&quot;/&gt; During their marriage, Octavia gave birth to two daughters (known as [[Antonia Major]] and [[Antonia Minor]]).

====War with Pompeius====

{{See|Sicilian revolt}}
Sextus Pompeius threatened Octavian in Italy by denying to the peninsula shipments of grain through the Mediterranean; Pompeius' own son was put in charge as naval commander in the effort to cause widespread famine in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 19&quot;/&gt; Pompeius' control over the sea prompted him to take on the name ''Neptuni filius'', &quot;son of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 22&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; A temporary peace agreement was reached in 39&amp;nbsp;BC with the treaty of Misenum; the blockade on Italy was lifted once Octavian granted Pompeius Sardinia, [[Corsica]], Sicily, and the [[Peloponnese]], and ensured him a future position as consul for  35&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 19&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 22&quot;/&gt; The territorial agreement amongst the triumvirs and Sextus Pompeius began to crumble once Octavian divorced Scribonia and married Livia on  17 January 38&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 23&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Pompeius' naval commanders betrayed him and handed over Corsica and Sardinia to Octavian. However Octavian needed Antony's additional support to attack Pompeius, so an agreement was reached with the Second Triumvirate's extension for another five-year period beginning in 37&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 24&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In supporting Octavian, Antony expected to gain support for his own campaign against Parthia, desiring to avenge Rome's [[Battle of Carrhae|defeat at Carrhae]] in 53&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 24&quot;/&gt; In an agreement reached at [[Taranto|Tarentum]], Antony provided 120 ships for Octavian to use against Pompeius, while Octavian was to send 20,000 [[Legionary|legionaries]] to Antony for use against Parthia.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 25&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Octavian sent only a tenth the number of those promised, which was viewed by Antony as an intentional provocation.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 25&quot;/&gt;

Octavian and Lepidus launched a joint operation against Sextus in Sicily in 36&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 25 26&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite setbacks for Octavian, the naval fleet of Sextus Pompeius was almost entirely destroyed on 3 September by general Agrippa at the naval [[battle of Naulochus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 26&quot;/&gt; Sextus fled with his remaining forces to the east, where he was captured and executed in [[Miletus]] by one of Antony's generals the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 26&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Lepidus and Octavian gathered the surrendered troops of Pompeius, yet Lepidus felt empowered enough to claim Sicily for himself, ordering Octavian to leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 26&quot;/&gt;  However, Lepidus' troops deserted him and defected to Octavian since they were weary of fighting and found Octavian's promises of money to be enticing.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 26&quot;/&gt; Lepidus surrendered to Octavian and was permitted to retain the office of ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' (head of the college of priests), but was ejected from the Triumvirate, his public career at an end, and was effectively exiled to a [[villa]] at Cape Circei in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 164&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman dominions were now divided between Octavian in the West and Antony in the East. To maintain peace and stability in his portion of the Empire, Octavian ensured Rome's citizens of their rights to property. This time he settled his discharged soldiers outside of Italy while returning 30,000 slaves to former Roman owners that had previously fled to Pompeius to join his army and navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 26 27&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;  To ensure his own safety and that of Livia and Octavia once he returned to Rome, Octavian had the Senate grant him, his wife, and his sister [[tribune|tribunal]] [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]], or ''sacrosanctitas''.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 27 28&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

====War with Antony====
{{Main|Final War of the Roman Republic}}
[[File:Lawrence Alma-Tadema- Anthony and Cleopatra.JPG|thumb|''Anthony and Cleopatra'', by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]]]

Meanwhile, Antony's campaign against Parthia turned disastrous, tarnishing his image as a leader, and the mere 2,000 legionaries sent by Octavian to Antony were hardly enough to replenish his forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 29&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Cleopatra could restore his army to full strength, and since he was already engaged in a romantic affair with her, he decided to send Octavia back to Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 29 30&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian used this to spread [[propaganda]] implying that Antony was becoming less than Roman because he rejected a legitimate Roman spouse for an &quot;Oriental [[Intimate relationship|paramour]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 30&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 36&amp;nbsp;BC, Octavian used a political ploy to make himself look less autocratic and Antony more the villain by proclaiming that the civil wars were coming to an end, and that he would step down as triumvir if only Antony would do the same; Antony refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 20&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Roman troops captured the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] in 34&amp;nbsp;BC, Antony made his son Alexander Helios the ruler of Armenia; he also awarded the title &quot;Queen of Kings&quot; to Cleopatra, acts which Octavian used to convince the Roman Senate that Antony had ambitions to diminish the preeminence of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 30&quot;/&gt; When Octavian became consul once again on  1 January 33&amp;nbsp;BC, he opened the following session in the Senate with a vehement attack on Antony's grants of titles and territories to his relatives and to his queen.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 31&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Defecting consuls and senators rushed over to the side of Antony in disbelief of the propaganda (which turned out to be true), yet so did able ministers desert Antony for Octavian in the autumn of 32&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 32 34&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt; These defectors, Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius, gave Octavian the information he needed to confirm with the Senate all the accusations he made against Antony.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 34&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; By storming the sanctuary of the Vestal Virgins, Octavian forced their chief priestess to hand over Antony's secret will, which would have given away Roman-conquered territories as kingdoms for his sons to rule, alongside plans to build a tomb in [[Alexandria]] for him and his queen to reside upon their deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 34 35&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 21 22&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 32&amp;nbsp;BC, the Senate officially revoked Antony's powers as consul and declared war on Cleopatra's regime in Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 35&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 22&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Castro Battle of Actium.jpg|thumb|left|''The [[Battle of Actium]]'', by Lorenzo Castro, painted 1672, National Maritime Museum, London]]

In early 31&amp;nbsp;BC, while Antony and Cleopatra were temporarily stationed in Greece, Octavian gained a preliminary victory when the navy under the command of Agrippa successfully ferried troops across the [[Adriatic Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 37&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; While Agrippa cut off Antony and Cleopatra's main force from their supply routes at sea, Octavian landed on the mainland opposite the island of Corcyra (modern [[Corfu]]) and marched south.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 37&quot;/&gt; Trapped on land and sea, deserters of Antony's army fled to Octavian's side daily while Octavian's forces were comfortable enough to make preparations.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 37&quot;/&gt; In a desperate attempt to break free of the [[Blockade|naval blockade]], Antony's fleet sailed through the bay of [[Actium]] on the western coast of Greece. It was there that Antony's fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller, more maneuverable ships under commanders Agrippa and [[Gaius Sosius]] in the [[battle of Actium]] on  2 September 31&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 38&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Antony and his remaining forces were only spared due to a last-ditch effort by Cleopatra's fleet that had been waiting nearby.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 38 39&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavian pursued them, and after another defeat in Alexandria on  1 August 30&amp;nbsp;BC, Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide; Antony fell on his own sword and into Cleopatra's arms, while she let a venomous snake bite her.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 39&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Having exploited his position as Caesar's heir to further his own political career, Octavian was only too well aware of the dangers in allowing another to do so and, reportedly commenting that &quot;two Caesars are one too many&quot;, he ordered [[Caesarion]]—Julius Caesar's son by Cleopatra—to be killed, whilst sparing Cleopatra's children by Antony, with the exception of Antony's [[Marcus Antonius Antyllus|older son]].&lt;ref&gt;Green (1990), 697.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Octavian had previously shown little mercy to military combatants and acted in ways that had proven unpopular with the Roman people, yet he was given credit for pardoning many of his opponents after the Battle of Actium.&lt;ref name = &quot;eck 49&quot;/&gt;

==Octavian becomes Augustus==
[[File:Octavian aureus circa 30 BCE.jpg|thumb|[[Aureus]] of Octavian, circa 30&amp;nbsp;BC, [[British Museum]]]]
After Actium and the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a position to rule the entire Republic under an unofficial [[principate]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 34 35&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; but would have to achieve this through incremental power gains, courting the Senate and the people, while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, to appear that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24 25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 38 39&quot;/&gt;  Marching into Rome, Octavian and [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Marcus Agrippa]] were elected as dual [[consul]]s by the Senate.&lt;ref name = &quot;eck 45&quot;/&gt;  Years of civil war had left Rome in a state of near lawlessness, but the Republic was not prepared to accept the control of Octavian as a despot.  At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars amongst the Roman generals, and even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the city of Rome and the [[Roman province]]s.  Octavian's aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections in name at least.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 44 45&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First settlement===
{{Main|Constitution of the Roman Empire|History of the Constitution of the Roman Empire}}
[[File:Caesar augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustus as a magistrate. The statue's marble head was made c. 30–20&amp;nbsp;BC, the body sculpted in the 2nd century AD ([[Louvre]], [[Paris]]).]]

In [[27 BC]], Octavian made a show of returning full power to the [[Roman Senate]] and relinquishing his control of the Roman provinces and their armies.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 45&quot;/&gt;  Under his consulship, however, the Senate had little power in initiating legislation by introducing [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] for senatorial debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 45&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Octavian was no longer in direct control of the provinces and their armies, he retained the loyalty of active duty soldiers and veterans alike.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 45&quot;/&gt;  The careers of many clients and adherents depended on his patronage, as his financial power in the Roman Republic was unrivaled.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 45&quot;/&gt;  The historian [[Werner Eck]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The sum of his power derived first of all from various powers of office delegated to him by the Senate and people, secondly from his immense private fortune, and thirdly from numerous patron-client relationships he established with individuals and groups throughout the Empire.  All of them taken together formed the basis of his ''auctoritas'', which he himself emphasized as the foundation of his political actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 113&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To a large extent the public was aware of the vast financial resources Augustus commanded.  When he failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy, he undertook direct responsibility for them in [[20 BC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 80&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was publicized on the Roman currency issued in [[16 BC]], after he donated vast amounts of money to the ''[[Aerarium|aerarium Saturni]]'', the public treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 80&quot;/&gt;

According to H.H. Scullard, however, Augustus's power was based on the exercise of &quot;a predominant military power and [...] the ultimate sanction of his authority was force, however much the fact was disguised.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Scullard_p211&quot;&gt;Scullard (1982), 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate proposed to Octavian, the victor of Rome's civil wars, that he once again assume command of the provinces. The senate's proposal was a ratification of Octavian's extra-constitutional power. Through the senate Octavian was able to continue the appearance of a still-functional [[constitution of the Roman Republic|constitution]]. Feigning reluctance, he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 46&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 210.&lt;/ref&gt;  The provinces ceded to him, that he might pacify them within the promised ten-year period, comprised much of the conquered Roman world, including all of [[Hispania]] and [[Gaul]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Ægyptus|Egypt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 46&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 34&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, command of these provinces provided Octavian with control over the majority of Rome's legions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 34&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 47&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Octavian acted as consul in Rome, he dispatched senators to the provinces under his command as his representatives to manage provincial affairs and ensure his orders were carried out.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 47&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, the provinces not under Octavian's control were overseen by governors chosen by the Roman Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 47&quot;/&gt; Octavian became the most powerful political figure in the city of Rome and in most of its provinces, but did not have sole monopoly on political and martial power.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24&quot;/&gt; The Senate still controlled North Africa, an important regional [[Roman agriculture|producer of grain]], as well as [[Illyria]] and Macedonia, two martially strategic regions with several legions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24&quot;/&gt; However, with control of only five or six legions distributed amongst three senatorial proconsuls, compared to the twenty legions under the control of Augustus, the Senate's control of these regions did not amount to any political or martial challenge to Octavian.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24 25&quot;&gt;CCAA, 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Scullard_p211&quot;/&gt; The Senate's control over some of the Roman provinces helped maintain a republican façade for the autocratic Principate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24 25&quot;/&gt; Also, Octavian's control of entire provinces for the objective of securing peace and creating stability followed Republican-era precedents, in which such prominent Romans as [[Pompey]] had been granted similar military powers in times of crisis and instability.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24 25&quot;/&gt;

In January of 27&amp;nbsp;BC, the Senate gave Octavian the new titles of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' and ''[[Princeps]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 50&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 50.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Augustus,'' from the Latin word ''Augere'' (meaning to increase), can be translated as &quot;the illustrious one&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 49&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 49.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a title of religious rather than political authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 49&quot;/&gt; According to Roman religious beliefs, the title symbolized a stamp of authority over humanity—and in fact nature—that went beyond any constitutional definition of his status. After the harsh methods employed in consolidating his control, the change in name would also serve to demarcate his benign reign as Augustus from his reign of terror as Octavian. His new title of Augustus was also more favorable than ''Romulus'', the previous one he styled for himself in reference to the story of [[Romulus and Remus]] (founders of Rome), which would symbolize a second founding of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 49&quot;/&gt; However, the title of ''Romulus'' was associated too strongly with notions of monarchy and kingship, an image Octavian tried to avoid.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 149&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 149&lt;/ref&gt; ''Princeps'', comes from the Latin phrase ''primum caput'', &quot;the first head&quot;, originally meaning the oldest or most distinguished senator whose name would appear first on the senatorial [[roster]]; in the case of Augustus it became an almost regnal title for a leader who was first in charge.&lt;ref&gt;Eck (2003), 3, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Princeps'' had also been a title under the Republic for those who had served the state well; for example, [[Pompey]] had held the title.  Augustus also styled himself as ''Imperator Caesar divi filius'', &quot;Commander Caesar son of the deified one&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 50&quot;/&gt; With this title he not only boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, but the use of ''[[Imperator]]'' signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 50&quot;/&gt; The word ''Caesar'' was merely a [[cognomen]] for one branch of the [[Julius|Julian family]], yet Augustus transformed ''Caesar'' into a new family line that began with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 50&quot;/&gt;

Augustus was granted the right to hang the ''[[corona civica]]'', the &quot;civic crown&quot; made from oak, above his door and have laurels drape his doorposts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; This crown was usually held above the head of a Roman general during a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], with the individual holding the crown charged to continually repeat &quot;''[[memento mori]]''&quot;, or, &quot;Remember, you are mortal&quot;, to the triumphant general. Additionally, laurel wreaths were important in several state ceremonies, and crowns of laurel were rewarded to champions of athletic, racing, and dramatic contests. Thus, both the laurel and the oak were integral symbols of Roman religion and statecraft; placing them on Augustus' doorposts was tantamount to declaring his home the capital. However, Augustus renounced flaunting insignia of power such as holding a [[scepter]], wearing a [[diadem (personal wear)|diadem]], or wearing the golden crown and purple [[toga]] of his predecessor Julius Caesar.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 13&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; If he refused to symbolize his power by donning and bearing these items on his person, the Senate nonetheless awarded him with a golden shield displayed in the meeting hall of the [[Curia]], bearing the inscription ''virtus'', ''pietas'', ''clementia'', ''iustitia''—&quot;valor, piety, clemency, and justice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 3&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 24&quot;/&gt;

===Second settlement===
In 23&amp;nbsp;BC, there was a political crisis that involved Augustus' co-consul [[Aulus Terentius Varro Murena|Terentius Varro Murena]], who was part of a conspiracy against Augustus. The exact details of the conspiracy are unknown, yet Murena did not serve a full term as consul before Calpurnius Piso was elected to replace him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 25&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 55&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Piso was a well known member of the republican faction, and serving as co-consul with him was another means by Augustus to show his willingness to make concessions and cooperate with all political parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 55 56&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late spring Augustus suffered a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would put in doubt the senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Augustus prepared to hand down his [[Seal (device)#Signet rings|signet ring]] to his favored general Agrippa.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56&quot;/&gt;  However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus' supposedly favored nephew [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] came away empty-handed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56&quot;/&gt; This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 38&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs, as a system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility amongst the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 38 39&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cameo August BM Gem3577.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Augustus wearing a ''[[gorgoneion]]'' on a three layered [[sardonyx]] cameo, AD 14/20]]
Soon after his bout of illness subsided, Augustus gave up his permanent consulship.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56&quot;/&gt; The only other times Augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 26&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had resigned as consul, Augustus retained his consular ''[[imperium]]'', leading to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 57&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a clever ploy by Augustus; by stepping down as one of two consuls, this allowed aspiring senators a better chance to fill that position, while at the same time Augustus could &quot;exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 36&quot;/&gt; Augustus was no longer in an official position to rule the state, yet his dominant position over the Roman provinces remained unchanged as he became a [[proconsul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 37&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier as a consul he had the power to intervene, when he deemed necessary, with the affairs of provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 56 57&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; As a proconsul Augustus did not want this authority of overriding provincial governors to be stripped from him, so ''imperium proconsulare maius'', or &quot;power over all the proconsuls&quot; was granted to Augustus by the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 57&quot;/&gt; The existence of ''imperium maius'' is debated by scholars, and it is also argued that he was only granted ''imperium aequum'', or power equal to that of the governors, but his supreme influence allowed him to control the affairs of the provinces.

Augustus was also granted the power of a [[tribune]] (''tribunicia potestas'') for life, though not the official title of tribune.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 57&quot;/&gt; Legally it was closed to [[Patrician (Ancient Rome)|patricians]], a status that Augustus had acquired years ago when adopted by Julius Caesar.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 36&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before it, veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, preside over elections, and the right to speak first at any meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 26&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 57 58&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the [[Roman censor]]; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a [[census]] and determine the membership of the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 59&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 59.&lt;/ref&gt; With the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all other attire besides the classic [[toga]] while entering the Forum.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 30&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 80&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 80.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]] had been granted similar powers, wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state, however this position did not extend to the censor's ability to hold a census and determine the Senate's roster. The office of the ''tribune plebis'' began to lose its prestige due to Augustus' amassing of tribunal powers, so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the [[praetor]]ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 427&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CaesarAugustusPontiusMaximusCloseup.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ''[[Via Labicana Augustus]]''—Augustus as [[Pontifex Maximus]]]]
In addition to tribunician authority, Augustus was granted sole ''imperium'' within the city of Rome itself: all armed forces in the city, formerly under the control of the [[prefect]]s and consuls, were now under the sole authority of Augustus.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 60&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  With ''maius imperium proconsulare'', Augustus was the only individual able to receive a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] as he was ostensibly the head of every Roman army.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 61&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In 19&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus the Younger|Lucius Cornelius Balbus]], governor of Africa and conqueror of the [[Garamantes]], was the first man of provincial origin to receive this award, as well as the last.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 61&quot;/&gt; For every following Roman victory the credit was given to Augustus, because Rome's armies were commanded by the [[legatus]], who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 61&quot;/&gt; Augustus' eldest son by marriage to Livia, [[Tiberius]], was the only exception to this rule when he received a triumph for victories in [[Germania]] in 7&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 117&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Ensuring that his status of ''maius imperium proconsulare'' was renewed in 13&amp;nbsp;BC, Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 26&quot;/&gt;

Many of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class. When Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22&amp;nbsp;BC, fears arose once again that Augustus was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19&amp;nbsp;BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#1 54.1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#6 6], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#10 10].&lt;/ref&gt; In 22&amp;nbsp;BC there was a food shortage in Rome which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 26&quot;/&gt; After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply &quot;by virtue of his proconsular ''imperium''&quot;, and ended the crisis almost immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 26&quot;/&gt; It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a ''praefectus annonae'', a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 78&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In 19&amp;nbsp;BC, the Senate voted to allow Augustus to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate,&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 60&quot;/&gt; as well as sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the [[fasces]], an emblem of consular authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 43&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like his tribune authority, the granting of consular powers to him was another instance of holding power of offices he did not actually hold.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 43&quot;/&gt; This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was actually a consul, the importance was that he appeared as one before the people. On 6 March 12&amp;nbsp;BC, after the death of [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], he additionally took up the position of [[pontifex maximus]], the high priest of the collegium of the Pontifices, the most important position in Roman religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock (1990), p. 380. The date is provided by inscribed calendars; see also Augustus, ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/2*.html#10 10.2]. Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#27.2 27.2] reports this under 13&amp;nbsp;BC, probably as the year in which Lepidus died (Bowersock (1990), p. 383).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 28&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  On  5 February 2&amp;nbsp;BC, Augustus was also given the title ''[[pater patriae]]'', or &quot;father of the country&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay (2004), 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 129&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Roman Emperors would generally be limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often, to display humility, newly appointed Emperors would decline one or more of the honorifics given to Augustus. Just as often, as their reign progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had actually been granted them by the Senate. The civic crown, which later Emperors took to actually wearing, consular insignia, and later the purple robes of a Triumphant general (''[[toga picta]]'') became the imperial insignia well into the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era.

''Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus'' chose ''Imperator'', &quot;victorious commander&quot; to be his first name, since he wanted to make the notion of victory associated with him emphatically clear.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 93&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 93.&lt;/ref&gt; By the year 13, Augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed &quot;imperator&quot; as his title after a successful battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 93&quot;/&gt; Almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]]'' was devoted to his military victories and honors.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 93&quot;/&gt; Augustus also promoted the ideal of a superior Roman civilization with a task of ruling the world (the extent to which the Romans knew it), a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet [[Virgil]] attributes to a legendary ancestor of Augustus: ''tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento''—&quot;Roman, remember by your strength to rule the Earth's peoples!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 30&quot;/&gt; The impulse for [[expansionism]], apparently prominent among all classes at Rome, is accorded divine sanction by Virgil's Jupiter, who in Book 1 of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' promises Rome ''imperium sine fine'', &quot;sovereignty without limit&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 95&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 95.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tiberius NyCarlsberg01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of [[Tiberius]], a successful military commander under Augustus before he was designated as his heir and successor]]

By the end of his reign, the armies of Augustus had conquered northern [[Hispania]] (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 94.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Alps|Alpine]] regions of [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]] (modern Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia),&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot;/&gt; [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and [[Pannonia]] (modern Albania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, etc.),&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot;/&gt; and extended the borders of the [[Africa Province]] to the east and south.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot;/&gt; After the reign of the [[client state|client king]] [[Herod the Great]] (73–4&amp;nbsp;BC), [[Iudaea Province|Judea]] was added to the [[Syria (Roman province)|province of Syria]] when Augustus deposed his successor [[Herod Archelaus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot;/&gt; Like Egypt which had been conquered after the defeat of Antony in 30&amp;nbsp;BC, Syria was governed not by a proconsul or legate of Augustus, but a high prefect of the equestrian class.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot;/&gt; Again, no military effort was needed in 25&amp;nbsp;BC when [[Galatia]] (modern Turkey) was converted to a Roman province shortly after [[Amyntas of Galatia]] was killed by an avenging widow of a slain prince from Homonada.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 94&quot;/&gt; When the rebellious tribes of [[Cantabria]] in modern-day Spain were finally quelled in 19&amp;nbsp;BC, the territory fell under the provinces of Hispania and [[Lusitania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 97&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 97.&lt;/ref&gt; This region proved to be a major asset in funding Augustus' future military campaigns, as it was rich in mineral deposits that could be fostered in Roman [[mining]] projects, especially the very rich [[gold]] deposits at [[Las Medulas]] for example.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 97&quot;/&gt;

Conquering the peoples of the Alps in 16&amp;nbsp;BC was another important victory for Rome since it provided a large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Rome's enemies in [[Germania]] to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 98&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Horace]] dedicated an ode to the victory, while the monument [[Trophy of Augustus]] near [[Monaco]] was built to honor the occasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 98 99&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12&amp;nbsp;BC, when [[Tiberius]] began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum and his brother [[Nero Claudius Drusus]] against the Germanic tribes of the eastern [[Rhineland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 99&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Both campaigns were successful, as Drusus' forces reached the [[Elbe]] River by 9&amp;nbsp;BC, yet he died shortly after by falling off his horse.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 99&quot;/&gt; It was recorded that the pious Tiberius walked in front of his brother's body all the way back to Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 416&quot;/&gt;

To protect Rome's eastern territories from the [[Parthian Empire]], Augustus relied on the [[client state]]s of the east to act as territorial [[Buffer state|buffers]] and areas which could raise their own troops for defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 96&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 96.&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure security of the Empire's eastern flank, Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria, while his skilled stepson Tiberius negotiated with the Parthians as Rome's diplomat to the East.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 96&quot;/&gt; Tiberius was responsible for restoring [[Tigranes V of Armenia|Tigranes V]] to the throne of the Kingdom of Armenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 416&quot;/&gt; Yet arguably his greatest diplomatic achievement was negotiating with [[Phraates IV of Parthia]] (37–2&amp;nbsp;BC) in 20&amp;nbsp;BC for the return of the [[Vexilloid|battle standards]] lost by [[Crassus]] in the [[Battle of Carrhae]], a symbolic victory and great boost of morale for Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 416&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 416.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 96&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brosius (2006), 96–97, 136–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Werner Eck claims that this was a great disappointment for Romans seeking to avenge Crassus' defeat by military means.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 95 96&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Maria Brosius explains that Augustus used the return of the standards as [[propaganda]] symbolizing the submission of Parthia to Rome. The event was celebrated in art such as the breastplate design on the statue [[Augustus of Prima Porta]] and in monuments such as the [[Forum of Augustus|Temple of Mars Ultor]] ('[[Mars (mythology)|Mars the Avenger]]') built to house the standards.&lt;ref&gt;Brosius (2006), 97; see also Bivar (1983), 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Parthia always posed a threat to Rome in the east, the real battlefront was along the  [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 96&quot;/&gt; Before the final fight with Antony, Octavian's campaigns against the tribes in [[Dalmatia]] was the first step in expanding Roman dominions to the Danube.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowell 13&quot;&gt;Rowell (1962), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Victory in battle was not always a permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome's enemies in Germania.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 96&quot;/&gt; A prime example of Roman loss in battle was the [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]] in AD 9, where three entire legions led by [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] were destroyed with few survivors by [[Arminius]], leader of the [[Cherusci]], an apparent Roman ally.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 101 102&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it, which had some success although the battle of AD 9 brought the end to Roman expansion into Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 417&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 417.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman general [[Germanicus]] took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and [[Segestes]]; they defeated  Arminius, who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to treachery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bunson 31&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and succession==

The illness of Augustus in 23&amp;nbsp;BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 50&quot;/&gt; If someone was to succeed his unofficial position of power, they were going to have to earn it through their own publicly proven merits.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 50&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sister's son [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]], who had been quickly married to Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 114 115&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians dispute this due to Augustus' will read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 115&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 115.&lt;/ref&gt; instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus' second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 44&quot;/&gt; After the death of Marcellus in 23&amp;nbsp;BC, Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Lucius Caesar]], [[Vipsania Julia]], [[Agrippina the Elder]], and [[Agrippa Postumus|Postumus Agrippa]], so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the Empire with the ''imperium'' of a proconsul and the same ''tribunicia potestas'' granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at [[Samos Island|Samos]] in the eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 44&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 58&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this granting of power would have shown Augustus' favor for Agrippa, it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 58&quot;/&gt;

Augustus' intent to make Gaius and Lucius Caesar his heirs was apparent when he adopted them as his own children.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 416–417.&lt;/ref&gt; He took the consulship in 5 and 2&amp;nbsp;BC so he could personally usher them into their political careers,&lt;ref&gt;Scullard (1982), 217.&lt;/ref&gt; and they were nominated for the consulships of AD 1 and 4.&lt;ref&gt;Syme (1939), 417.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage, [[Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus]] and [[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius]], granting them military commands and public office, and seeming to favor Drusus. However, Drusus' marriage to Antonia, Augustus' niece, was a relationship far too embedded within the family to disturb over succession issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 116&quot;/&gt; After Agrippa died in 12&amp;nbsp;BC, Livia's son Tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife Vipsania and marry Agrippa's widow, Augustus' daughter Julia—as soon as a period of mourning for Agrippa had ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 116&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 116.&lt;/ref&gt; While Drusus' marriage to Antonia was considered an unbreakable affair, Vipsania was &quot;only&quot; the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 116&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Augustuksen mauseleomi.JPG|thumb|[[Mausoleum of Augustus]]]]
Tiberius shared in Augustus' tribune powers as of 6&amp;nbsp;BC, but shortly thereafter went into retirement, reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 117&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 46&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no specific reason is known for his departure, it could have been a combination of reasons, including a failing marriage with Julia.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 117&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 46&quot;/&gt; It could very well have been from feelings of jealousy and being left out since Augustus' young grandchildren-turned-sons, Gaius and Lucius, joined the college of priests at an early age, were presented to spectators in a more favorable light, and were introduced to the army in Gaul.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 117 118&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 46 47&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; After the early deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier death of his brother Drusus (9&amp;nbsp;BC), Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he, in turn, adopt his nephew [[Germanicus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 119&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 119.&lt;/ref&gt; This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 116&quot;/&gt; In that year, Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul, emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him, and by 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of ''imperium'' with that of Augustus.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 119 120&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; The only other possible claimant as heir was [[Agrippa Postumus|Postumus Agrippa]], who had been exiled by Augustus in AD 7, his banishment made permanent by senatorial decree, and Augustus officially disowned him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 49&quot;/&gt; He certainly fell out of Augustus' favor as an heir; the historian Erich S. Gruen notes various contemporary sources that state Postumus Agrippa was a &quot;vulgar young man, brutal and brutish, and of depraved character.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 49&quot;&gt;Gruen (2005), 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Postumus Agrippa was murdered at his place of exile either shortly before or after the death of Augustus.

On 19 August AD 14, Augustus died while visiting the place of his father's death at [[Nola]], and Tiberius—who was present alongside Livia at Augustus' deathbed—was named his heir.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 123&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus' famous last words were, &quot;Have I played the part well? Then applaud as I exit&quot;—referring to the play-acting and regal authority that he had put on as emperor. Publicly, though, his last words were, &quot;Behold, I found Rome of clay, and leave her to you of marble.&quot; An enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with Augustus' body from Nola to Rome, and on the day of his burial all public and private businesses closed for the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 123&quot;/&gt; Tiberius and his son Drusus delivered the eulogy while standing atop two ''[[rostra]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 124&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Coffin-bound, Augustus' body was cremated on a pyre close to [[Mausoleum of Augustus|his mausoleum]]. It was proclaimed that Augustus joined the company of the gods as a member of the Roman [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 124&quot;/&gt; In 410, during the [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome]], the mausoleum was despoiled by the Goths and his ashes scattered.

The historian D.C.A. Shotter states that Augustus' policy of favoring the Julian family line over the Claudian might have afforded Tiberius sufficient cause to show open disdain for Augustus after the latter's death; instead, Tiberius was always quick to rebuke those who criticized Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Shotter (1966), 210–212.&lt;/ref&gt; Shotter suggests that Augustus' deification, coupled with Tiberius' &quot;extremely conservative&quot; attitude towards religion, obliged Tiberius to suppress any open resentment he might have harbored.&lt;ref name=&quot;shotter 211&quot;&gt;Shotter (1966), 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the historian R. Shaw-Smith points to letters of Augustus to Tiberius which display affection towards Tiberius and high regard for his military merits.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw-smith 213&quot;/&gt; Shotter states that Tiberius focused his anger and criticism on [[Gaius Asinius Gallus]] (for marrying Vipsania after Augustus forced Tiberius to divorce her) as well as the two young Caesars Gaius and Lucius, instead of Augustus, the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;shotter 211&quot;/&gt;

[[File:aug11 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Laureate bust of Augustus]]
Augustus' reign laid the foundations of a regime that lasted for nearly fifteen hundred years through the ultimate [[decline of the Roman Empire|decline of the Western Roman Empire]] and until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453. Both his adoptive surname, Caesar, and his title ''Augustus'' became the permanent titles of the rulers of [[Roman Empire]] for fourteen centuries after his death, in use both at [[Rome|Old Rome]] and at [[Constantinople|New Rome]]. In many languages, ''caesar'' became the word for ''emperor'', as in the German ''[[Kaiser]]'' and in the Bulgarian and subsequently Russian ''[[Tsar]]''. The cult of ''Divus Augustus'' continued until the state religion of the Empire was changed to [[Christianity]] in 391 by [[Theodosius I]]. Consequently, there are many excellent statues and busts of the first emperor. He had composed an account of his achievements, the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', to be inscribed in bronze in front of [[Mausoleum of Augustus|his mausoleum]].&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#101.4 101.4].&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the Empire upon his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 1 2&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it, and were inscribed on many public edifices, such as the temple in [[Ankara]] dubbed the ''Monumentum Ancyranum'', called the &quot;queen of inscriptions&quot; by historian [[Theodor Mommsen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 2&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few known written works by Augustus that have survived. This includes his poems ''Sicily'', ''Epiphanus'', and ''Ajax'', an autobiography of 13 books, a philosophical treatise, and his written rebuttal to Brutus' ''Eulogy of Cato''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 47&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians are able to analyze existing letters penned by Augustus to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life.&lt;ref name=&quot;shaw-smith 213&quot;&gt;Shaw-Smith (1971), 213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourne (1918), 53–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many consider Augustus to be Rome's greatest emperor; his policies certainly extended the Empire's life span and initiated the celebrated ''Pax Romana'' or ''Pax Augusta''. He was intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as [[Julius Caesar]], and was influenced on occasion by his third wife, Livia (sometimes for the worse). Nevertheless, his legacy proved more enduring. The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus, with Rome's first institutionalized [[History of criminal justice|police force]], [[fire fighting]] force, and the establishment of the municipal [[prefect]] as a permanent office.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 79&quot;/&gt; The police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each, while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1,000 men each, with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 79&quot;/&gt; A ''praefectus vigilum'', or &quot;Prefect of the Watch&quot; was put in charge of the [[vigiles]], Rome's fire brigade and police.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 345&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 345.&lt;/ref&gt; With Rome's civil wars at an end, Augustus was also able to create a [[standing army]] for the Roman Empire, fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 85 86&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by numerous [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] units of 500 soldiers each, often recruited from recently conquered areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 86&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 86.&lt;/ref&gt; With his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus also installed an official [[courier]] system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the ''praefectus vehiculorum''.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 81&quot;/&gt; Besides the advent of swifter communication amongst Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Rome's armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;chisholm 122&quot;&gt;Chisholm (1981), 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 6 Augustus established the ''aerarium militare'', donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 6&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most lasting institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the [[Praetorian Guard]] in 27&amp;nbsp;BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 341&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 341.&lt;/ref&gt; They had the power to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was [[Maxentius]], as it was [[Constantine I]] who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the [[Castra Praetoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 341 342&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 341–342.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Augustus-in-Kalabsha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Augustus in an Egyptian-style depiction, a stone carving of the [[New Kalabsha|Kalabsha Temple]] in [[Nubia]]]]
Although the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29&amp;nbsp;BC, Augustus paid 400 [[sestertius|sesterces]] each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 23&quot;/&gt; He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the [[Roman mythology|Roman pantheon]] of deities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 23&quot;&gt;Eder (2005), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 28&amp;nbsp;BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccaa 23&quot;/&gt;

The longevity of Augustus' reign and its legacy to the Roman world should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success. As [[Tacitus]] wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 1#3|I.3]]&lt;/ref&gt; Had Augustus died earlier (in 23&amp;nbsp;BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a [[de facto]] monarchy in these years. Augustus' own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 124&quot;/&gt; The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelsall 120&quot;&gt;Kelsall (1976), 120.&lt;/ref&gt; However, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]] (d. AD 10/11), fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican [[liberty]] in which he had been born, openly criticized the Augustan regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;starr 5&quot;&gt;Starr (1952), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (c. 56–c.117) wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery.&lt;ref name=&quot;starr 5&quot;/&gt; He continued to say that, with Augustus' death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome simply traded one slaveholder for another.&lt;ref name=&quot;starr 5&quot;/&gt; Tacitus, however, records two contradictory but common views of Augustus:

[[File:0005MAN-OctAugusto.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a bronze equestrian statue of Augustus, 1st century AD]]
{{quote|Intelligent people praised or criticized him in varying ways. One opinion was as follows. Filial duty and a national emergency, in which there was no place for law-abiding conduct, had driven him to civil war—and this can neither be initiated nor maintained by decent methods. He had made many concessions to Anthony and to Lepidus for the sake of vengeance on his father's murderers. When Lepidus grew old and lazy, and Anthony's self-indulgence got the better of him, the only possible cure for the distracted country had been government by one man. However, Augustus had put the state in order not by making himself king or dictator, but by creating the Principate. The empire's frontiers were on the ocean, or distant rivers. Armies, provinces, fleets, the whole system was interrelated. Roman citizens were protected by the law. Provincials were decently treated. Rome itself had been lavishly beautified. Force had been sparingly used—merely to preserve peace for the majority.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, The Annals, I 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the second opposing opinion:
{{quote|filial duty and national crisis had been merely pretexts. In actual fact, the motive of Octavian, the future Augustus, was lust for power...There had certainly been peace, but it was a blood-stained peace of disasters and assassinations.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, The Annals, I 10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a recent biography on Augustus, Anthony Everitt asserts that through the centuries, judgments on Augustus' reign have oscillated between these two extremes but stresses that:

{{quote|&quot;Opposites do not have to be mutually exclusive, and we are not obliged to choose one or the other. The story of his career shows that Augustus was indeed ruthless, cruel, and ambitious for himself. This was only in part a personal trait, for upper-class Romans were educated to compete with one another and to excel. However, he combined an overriding concern for his personal interests with a deep-seated patriotism, based on a nostalgia of Rome's antique virtues. In his capacity as ''princeps'', selfishness and selflessness coexisted in his mind. While fighting for dominance, he paid little attention to legality or to the normal civilities of political life. He was devious, untrustworthy, and bloodthirsty. But once he had established his authority, he governed efficiently and justly, generally allowed freedom of speech, and promoted the rule of law. He was immensely hardworking and tried as hard as any [[Democracy in Ancient Rome|democratic]] parliamentarian to treat his senatorial colleagues with respect and sensitivity. He suffered from no delusions of grandeur.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Everitt (2006), 324–325.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tacitus was of the belief that [[Nerva]] (r. 96–98) successfully &quot;mingled two formerly alien ideas, principate and liberty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;starr 6&quot;&gt;Starr (1952), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign, moderate ruler, yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus, Dio viewed Augustus as an [[autocrat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;starr 5&quot;/&gt; The poet [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus]] (AD 39–65) was of the opinion that Caesar's victory over Pompey and the fall of [[Cato the Younger]] (95 BC–46&amp;nbsp;BC) marked the end of traditional liberty in Rome; historian Chester G. Starr, Jr. writes of his avoidance of criticizing Augustus, &quot;perhaps Augustus was too sacred a figure to accuse directly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;starr 6&quot;/&gt;

The [[Anglo-Irish]] writer [[Jonathan Swift]] (1667–1745), in his ''Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome'', criticized Augustus for installing tyranny over Rome, and likened what he believed [[Great Britain]]'s virtuous [[constitutional monarchy]] to Rome's moral Republic of the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelsall 118&quot;&gt;Kelsall (1976), 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In his criticism of Augustus, the admiral and historian [[Thomas Gordon (Royal Scots Navy officer)|Thomas Gordon]] (1658–1741) compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1599–1658).&lt;ref name=&quot;kelsall 118&quot;/&gt; Thomas Gordon and the [[France|French]] political philosopher [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] (1689–1755) both remarked that Augustus was a coward in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelsall 119&quot;&gt;Kelsall (1976), 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus'', the [[Scotland|Scottish]] scholar [[Thomas Blackwell (scholar)|Thomas Blackwell]] (1701–1757) deemed Augustus a [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian ruler]], &quot;a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper&quot;, &quot;wicked and worthless&quot;, &quot;a mean spirit&quot;, and a &quot;tyrant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelsall 119&quot;/&gt;

===Revenue reforms===
[[File:AugustusCoinPudukottaiHoardIndia.jpg|thumb|Coin of Augustus found at the [[Pudukottai]] hoard, from an [[ancient Tamil country]], [[Pandyan Kingdom]] of present day [[Tamil Nadu]] in [[India]]. [[British Museum]]]]

Augustus' public [[revenue]] reforms had a great impact on the subsequent success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 83 84&quot;/&gt; This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 83 84&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; The measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population [[census]], with fixed quotas for each province.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 404&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 404.&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 404&quot;/&gt; Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the [[next of kin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 404&quot;/&gt;

[[File:AugustusIndianImitation1stCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|left|Indian imitation of a coin of Augustus. 1st century. [[British Museum]]]]

An equally important reform was the abolition of private [[tax farming]], which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors that raised taxes had been the norm in the Republican era, and some had grown powerful enough to influence the amount of votes for politicians in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 83 84&quot;/&gt; The tax farmers had gained great infamy for their depredations, as well as great private wealth, by winning the right to tax local areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 83 84&quot;/&gt; Rome's revenue was the amount of the successful bids, and the tax farmers' profits consisted of any additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with Rome's blessing. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers' desire to maximize their profits, had produced a system of arbitrary exactions that was often barbarously cruel to taxpayers, widely (and accurately) perceived as unfair, and very harmful to investment and the economy.

The use of [[Ægyptus|Egypt]]'s immense land rents to finance the Empire's operations resulted from Augustus' conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 144&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 144.&lt;/ref&gt; As it was effectively considered Augustus' private property rather than a province of the Empire, it became part of each succeeding emperor's patrimonium.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 144 145&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a legate or proconsul, Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports; this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming [[Praetorian prefect|Prefect of the Praetorian Guard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 145&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions,&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 144&quot;/&gt; as well as bread and circuses for the population of Rome.

===Month of August===
The month of [[August]] (Latin: ''Augustus'') is named after Augustus; until his time it was called [[Sextilis]] (named so because it had been the sixth month of the original [[Roman calendar]] and the Latin word for six was ''sex''). Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of [[Julius Caesar]]'s July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]]. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see [[Julian calendar]]). According to a ''senatus consultum'' quoted by [[Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius|Macrobius]], Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of [[Alexandria]], fell in that month.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius|Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#12.35 1.12.35].&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that it was not his birthday month.)

[[File:RomaAraPacisDecorazioneVegetale.jpg|thumb|Close up on the sculpted detail of the [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Peace), 13&amp;nbsp;BC to 9 BC]]
On his deathbed, Augustus boasted &quot;I found a Rome of bricks; I leave to you one of marble&quot;. Although there is some truth in the literal meaning of this, [[Cassius Dio]] asserts that it was a metaphor for the Empire's strength.&lt;ref name=&quot;dio 56.30.3&quot;&gt;Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/56*.html#30 56.30.3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marble]] could be found in buildings of Rome before Augustus, but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of Augustus.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 34&quot;/&gt;  Although this did not apply to the [[Subura]] slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental topography of the centre and of the [[Campus Martius]], with the [[Ara Pacis]] (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central [[gnomon]] was an [[obelisks of Rome|obelisk]] taken from Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 122&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[relief]] sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus' triumphs in the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 32&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the [[praetor]]ians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 32&quot;/&gt;  He also built the [[Temple of Caesar]], the [[Baths of Agrippa]], and the [[Forum of Augustus]] with its [[Temple of Mars Ultor]]. Other projects were either encouraged by him, such as the [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus (minor)|Theatre of Balbus]], and Agrippa's construction of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], or funded by him in the name of others, often relations (e.g. [[Porticus Octaviae|Portico of Octavia]], [[Theatre of Marcellus]]). Even his [[Mausoleum of Augustus]] was built before his death to house members of his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 118 121&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 118–121&lt;/ref&gt; To celebrate his victory at the Battle of Actium, the [[Arch of Augustus, Rome|Arch of Augustus]] was built in 29&amp;nbsp;BC near the entrance of the [[Temple of Castor and Pollux]], and widened in 19&amp;nbsp;BC to include a triple-arch design.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 34&quot;/&gt; There are also many buildings outside of the city of Rome that bear Augustus' name and legacy, such as the [[Merida, Spain|Theatre of Merida]] in modern Spain, the [[Maison Carrée]] built at [[Nîmes]] in today's southern France, as well as the [[Trophy of Augustus]] at [[La Turbie]], located near [[Monaco]].

[[File:Vienne-RomanTemple2.JPG|thumb|The Temple of Augustus and Livia in [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]], late 1st century BC]]
After the death of Agrippa in 12&amp;nbsp;BC, a solution had to be found in maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 79&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 79.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 79&quot;/&gt; In the late Augustan era, the commission of five senators called the ''curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum'' (translated as &quot;Supervisors of Public Property&quot;) was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of the state cult.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 79&quot;/&gt;  Augustus created the senatorial group of the ''curatores viarum'' (translated as &quot;Supervisors for Roads&quot;) for the upkeep of roads; this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;eck 81&quot;&gt;Eck (2003), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Corinthian order]] of architectural style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 34&quot;&gt;Bunson (1994), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suetonius]] once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunson 34&quot;/&gt;

==Physical appearance==
The biographer [[Suetonius]] describes Augustus' outward appearance as follows: &quot;He was unusually handsome&amp;nbsp;... He had clear, bright eyes&amp;nbsp;... His teeth were wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclining to [[blond|golden]]; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#79 79], translated by [[John Carew Rolfe|J. C. Rolfe]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''geography of Antarctica''' is dominated by its [[polar region|south polar location]] and, thus, by [[ice]].  The [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[continent]], located in the [[Earth]]'s [[southern hemisphere]], is centered asymmetrically around the [[South Pole]] and largely south of the [[Antarctic Circle]].  It is surrounded by the southern waters of the [[World Ocean]] – alternatively (depending on source), it is washed by the [[Southern Ocean|Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean]] or the southern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s.  With an area of more than 14 million&amp;nbsp;km², it is the fifth-largest continent and is about 1.3 times larger than [[Europe]].

Some 98% of Antarctica is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], the world's largest [[ice sheet]] and also its largest reservoir of [[fresh water]].  Averaging at least 1.6&amp;nbsp;km thick, the ice is so massive that it has [[post-glacial rebound|depressed the continental bedrock]] in some areas more than 2.5&amp;nbsp;km below sea level; subglacial lakes of liquid [[water]] also occur (e.g., [[Lake Vostok]]).  [[Ice shelf|Ice shelves]] and [[ice rise|rises]] populate the ice sheet on the periphery.  Only about 2% of the continent is not  covered by ice.

==Regions==
[[File:Antarctica.A2010286.0735.250m.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Princesses Astrid and Ragnhild Coasts]]
[[File:Antarctica.A2010287.0140.250m.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Banzare, Sabrina, and Budd Law Dome Coasts]]
Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Western Antarctica]] and [[Eastern Antarctica]] correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich meridian]]. This usage has been regarded as [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] by some, and the alternative terms Lesser Antarctica and Greater Antarctica (respectively) are sometimes preferred.

Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. There has been some concern about this [[ice sheet]], because there is a small chance that it will collapse. If it does, ocean levels would rise by a few metres in a very short period of time.

==Volcanoes==
There are four [[volcano]]es on the mainland of Antarctica that are
considered to be active on the basis of observed fumarolic activity or
&quot;recent&quot; tephra deposits: 
[[Mount Melbourne]] (2,730 m) (74°21'S., 164°42'E.), a stratovolcano; 
[[Mount Berlin]] (3,500 m) (76°03'S., 135°52'W.), a stratovolcano; 
Mount Kauffman (2,365 m) (75°37'S., 132°25'W.), a stratovolcano; and 
[[Mount Hampton]] (3,325 m) (76°29'S., 125°48'W.), a volcanic caldera.
 
Several volcanoes on offshore islands have records of historic activity.
[[Mount Erebus]] (3,795 m), a stratovolcano on
[[Ross Island]] with 10 known eruptions and 1 suspected eruption.
On the opposite side of the continent, 
[[Deception Island]]
(62°57'S., 60°38'W.), a volcanic caldera with 10 known
and 4 suspected eruptions, have been the most active.
[[Buckle Island]] in the [[Balleny Islands]] (66°50'S., 163°12'E.), 
[[Penguin Island (South Shetland Islands)|Penguin Island]] (62°06'S., 57°54'W.), 
Paulet Island (63°35'S., 55°47'W.), and 
Lindenberg Island (64°55'S., 59°40'W.) are also 
considered to be active.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is no economic activity in [[Antarctica]] at present, except for fishing off the coast and small-scale [[Tourism in Antarctica|tourism]], both based outside Antarctica. The [[Antarctican dollar]], a souvenir item sold in the United States and Canada, is not legal tender.

==Fisheries==
Antarctic fisheries in 1998–1999 (July 1 - June 30) reported landing 119,898 tonnes.  Unregulated fishing landed five to six times more than the regulated fishery, and allegedly illegal fishing in Antarctic waters in 1998 resulted in the seizure (by France and Australia) of at least eight fishing ships. See [[Ocean fisheries#Southern Ocean]].

==Tourism==
Small-scale tourism has existed since the 1950s. Since 1969, over 30,000 tourists have been to Antarctica.[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm] A total of 10,013 tourists visited in the 1998–1999 summer, up from the 9,604 who visited the previous year. Nearly all of them were passengers on 16 commercial (nongovernmental) ships and several [[yacht]]s that made 116 trips during the summer. Most tourist trips last about two weeks.

As of 2006, several ships transport people to Antarctica to visit specific scenic locations. There are also sight-seeing overflights from Australia which fly nonstop over Antarctica and return, although overflights from New Zealand stopped after the fatal crash of [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] on [[Mount Erebus]] in late 1979.

== Scientific stations ==
About 30 countries maintain about seventy [[Research stations of Antarctica|research stations]] (40 year-round or permanent, and 30 summer-only) in Antarctica, with an approximate population of 4000 in summer and 1000 in winter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Transport in Antarctica''' has transformed from explorers crossing the isolated remote area of [[Antarctica]] [[walking|by foot]] to a more open area due to human technologies enabling more convenient and faster transport, predominantly by air and water, as well as land. 
Transportation technologies on a remote area like Antarctica need to be able to deal with extremely low [[temperature]]s and continuous [[wind]]s to ensure the travelers' safety. Due to the fragility of the Antarctic environment, only a limited amount of transport movements can take place and sustainable transportation technologies have to be used to reduce the [[ecological footprint]].
The [[infrastructure]] of land, water and air transport needs to be safe and sustainable. 
Currently thousands of tourists and hundreds of scientists a year rely on the Antarctic transportation system.

==Land transport==
[[Image:Antarctica Route 1.jpg|thumb|right|Antarctica Route 1]]
Land transport in Antarctica is usually by foot ([[ski]]s, [[snowshoe]]s) or [[vehicle]]s ([[tracked vehicle]]s like [[snow mobile]]s and [[bulldozer]]s and in the past [[dog sled]]s). Shackleton's 1907-09 [[Nimrod Expedition]] pioneered motorised traction.   

Mawson station started using classic Volkswagen Beetles, the first production cars to be used in Antarctica. The first of these was named 'Antarctica 1'. However, the scarcity and poor quality of [[road]] infrastructure limits land transportation by conventional vehicles. Winds continuously blow snow on the roads. The [[McMurdo-South Pole highway]] is a  900-mile (1450&amp;nbsp;km) road in Antarctica linking the United States [[McMurdo Station]] on the coast to the [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]].

In 2005 a team of six people took part in the Ice special people Expedition. Travelling in a specially designed six wheel drive vehicle, the team completed the journey from the [[Antarctic]] coast at Patriot Hills to the geographic [[South Pole]] in an incredible 69 hours. In doing so they easily beat the previous record of 24 days. They arrived at the South Pole on the 12th of December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icechallenger.co.uk/ Ice Challenger 2005 &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] Retrieved on 2008-10-14&lt;/ref&gt;
The team members on that expedition were [[Andrew Regan]], [[Jason De Carteret]], Andrew Moon, Richard Griffiths, Gunnar Egilsson and Andrew Miles. 
The expedition successfully showed that wheeled transport on the continent is not only possible but also often more practical. The expedition also hoped to raise awareness about global warming and climate change.

A second expedition led by Andrew Regan and Andrew Moon departed in November 2010. The Moon-Regan Trans Antarctic Expedition this time traversed the entire continent twice, using 2 six wheel drive vehicles and a Concept Ice Vehicle designed by Lotus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transantarcticexpedition.com/ Trans Antarctic Expedition &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] Retrieved on 2011-02-20&lt;/ref&gt; This time the team used the expedition to raise awareness about the global environmental importance of the Antarctic region and to show that [[biofuel]] can be a viable and environmentally friendly option.

==Water transport==
[[File:National Geographic Explorer in fast ice, Antarctica - edit 1.jpg|thumb|A tour boat in fast ice near the coast]]
Antarctica's only harbour is at [[McMurdo Station]]. Most coastal stations have offshore anchorages, and supplies are transferred from ship to shore by small boats, barges, and helicopters. A few stations have a basic wharf facility. All ships at port are subject to inspection in accordance with Article 7, [[Antarctic Treaty]]. Offshore anchorage is sparse and intermittent, but poses no problem to sailboats designed for the ice, typically with lifting keels and long shorelines.
[[McMurdo Station]] ({{coord|77|51|S|166|40|E|}}), [[Palmer Station]] ({{coord|64|43|S|64|03|W|}}); government use only except by permit (see Permit Office under &quot;Legal System&quot;). A number of tour boats, ranging from large motorized vessels to small sailing yachts, visit the Antarctic Peninsula during the summer months (January–March). Most are based in [[Ushuaia]], Argentina.

==Air transport==
Transport in Antarctica takes place by air, using [[airplane]]s and [[helicopter]]s.
Airplane runways and helicopter pads have to be kept snow free to ensure safe take off and landing conditions.

Antarctica has [[List of airports in Antarctica|20 airports]], but there are no developed public-access airports or landing facilities. Thirty stations, operated by 16 national governments party to the [[Antarctic Treaty]], have landing facilities for either [[helicopter]]s and/or [[fixed-wing aircraft]]; commercial enterprises operate two additional air facilities.

Helicopter pads are available at 27 stations; runways at 15 locations are gravel, sea-ice, blue-ice, or compacted snow suitable for landing wheeled, fixed-wing aircraft; of these, 1 is greater than 3&amp;nbsp;km in length, 6 are between 2&amp;nbsp;km and 3&amp;nbsp;km in length, 3 are between 1&amp;nbsp;km and 2&amp;nbsp;km in length, 3 are less than 1&amp;nbsp;km in length, and 2 are of unknown length; snow surface skiways, limited to use by [[ski]]-equipped, fixed-wing aircraft, are available at another 15 locations; of these, 4 are greater than 3&amp;nbsp;km in length, 3 are between 2&amp;nbsp;km and 3&amp;nbsp;km in length, 2 are between 1&amp;nbsp;km and 2&amp;nbsp;km in length, 2 are less than 1&amp;nbsp;km in length, and data is unavailable for the remaining 4. 

Antarctic airports are subject to severe restrictions and limitations resulting from extreme seasonal and geographic conditions; they do not meet [[ICAO]] standards, and advance approval from the respective governmental or nongovernmental operating organization is required for landing (1999 est.) Flights to the continent in the permanent darkness of the winter are normally only undertaken in an emergency, with burning barrels of fuel to outline a runway. On September 11, 2008, a United States Air Force [[C-17 Globemaster III]] successfully completed the first landing in Antarctica using [[night-vision goggles]] at [[Pegasus Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=1544|title=Air Force successfully tests new capability to fly any time of year to McMurdo|work=Antarctic Sun|first=Peter|last=Rejcek|date=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical features==
{{see also|Geology of Alabama}}
Extending entirely across the    state of Alabama for about {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} south of its northern boundary, and in the middle stretching {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} farther south, is the [[Cumberland Plateau]], or [[Tennessee Valley]] region, broken into broad tablelands by the dissection of rivers. In the northern part of this plateau, west of [[Jackson County, Alabama|Jackson county]], there are about {{convert|5280000|sqft|m2|-3}} of level highlands from 700 to {{convert|800|ft|m|-1}} above sea level. South of these highlands, occupying a narrow strip on each side of the [[Tennessee River]], is a country of gentle rolling lowlands varying in elevation from 500 to {{convert|800|ft|m|-1}}.  To the northeast of these highlands and lowlands is a rugged section with steep mountain-sides, deep narrow coves and valleys, and flat mountain-tops.  Its elevations range from 400 to {{convert|1800|ft|m|-1}}.  In the remainder of this region, the southern portion, the most prominent feature is ''Little Mountain'', extending about {{convert|80|mi|km|0}} from east to west between two valleys, and rising precipitously on the north side {{convert|500|ft|m|-1}} above them or {{convert|1000|ft|m}} above the sea.

Adjoining the Cumberland Plateau region on the southeast is the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|Appalachian Valley]] (locally known as Coosa Valley) region, which is the southern extremity of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], and occupies an area within the state of about {{convert|8000|sqmi|km2|-3}}.  This is a [[limestone]] belt with parallel hard rock ridges left standing by erosion to form mountains.  Although the general direction of the mountains, ridges, and valleys is northeast and southwest, irregularity is one of the most prominent characteristics.  In the northeast are several flat-topped mountains, of which Raccoon and [[Lookout Mountain|Lookout]] are the most prominent, having a maximum elevation near the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] line of little more than {{convert|1800|ft|m|-1}} and gradually decreasing in height toward the southwest, where [[Sand Mountain (Alabama)|Sand Mountain]] is a continuation of Raccoon.  South of these the mountains are marked by steep northwest sides, sharp crests and gently sloping southeast sides.

Southeast of the Appalachian Valley region, the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]] also crosses the Alabama border from the N.E. and occupies a small triangular-shaped section of which [[Randolph County, Alabama|Randolph]] and [[Clay County, Alabama|Clay]] counties, together with the northern part of [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] and [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], form the principal portion.  Its surface is gently undulating and has an elevation of about {{convert|1000|ft|m|-2}} above sea level.  The Piedmont Plateau is a lowland worn down by erosion on hard crystalline rocks, then uplifted to form a plateau.

The remainder of the state is occupied by the ''Coastal Plain''.  This is crossed by foot-hills and rolling prairies in the central part of the state, where it has a mean elevation of about {{convert|600|ft|m|-1}}, becomes lower and more level toward the southwest, and in the extreme south is flat and but slightly elevated above the sea.
The Cumberland Plateau region is drained to the west-northwest by the [[Tennessee River]] and its tributaries; all other parts of the state are drained to the southwest. In the Appalachian Valley region the [[Coosa River]] is the principal river; and in the Piedmont Plateau, the [[Tallapoosa River]].  In the Coastal Plain are the [[Tombigbee River]] in the west, the [[Alabama River]] (formed by the Coosa and Tallapoosa) in the western central, and in the east the [[Chattahoochee River]], which forms almost half of the Georgia boundary.  The Tombigbee and Alabama rivers unite near the southwest corner of the state, their waters discharging into [[Mobile Bay]] by the [[Mobile River|Mobile]] and Tensas rivers.  The [[Black Warrior River]] is a considerable stream which joins the Tombigbee from the east.

The valleys in the north and northeast are usually deep and narrow, but in the Coastal Plain they are broad and in most cases rise in three successive terraces above the stream.  The harbour of Mobile was formed by the drowning of the lower part of the valley of the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers as a result of the sinking of the land here, such sinking having occurred on other parts of the Gulf coast.

==Flora and fauna==

The fauna and flora of Alabama are similar to those of the Gulf states in general and have no distinctive characteristics. However, the [[Mobile River]] system has a high incidence of endemism among freshwater mollusks and biodiversity is high.

In Alabama, vast forests of [[pine]] constitute the largest proportion of the state's forest growth. There is also an abundance of [[Taxodium|cypress]], [[hickory]], [[oak]], [[populus]], and [[juniperus virginiana|Eastern Redcedar]] trees. In other areas, [[conium|hemlock]] growths in the north and [[chamaecyparis thyoides|Southern White Cedar]] in the southwest. Other native trees include [[ash tree|ash]], [[celtis|hackberry]], and [[holly]]. In the Gulf Region of the state grow various species of [[palmetto]] and [[arecaceae|palm]]. In Alabama there are more than 150 [[shrub]]s, including [[kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] and [[rhododendron]]. Among cultivated plants are [[wisteria]] and [[camellia]].

While in the past the state enjoyed a variety of mammals such as [[Plains Bison]], [[Eastern elk]], [[bear]], and [[deer]], only the [[White-tailed deer]] remains abundant. Still fairly common are the [[North American Cougar]], [[Bobcat]], [[American Beaver]], [[Muskrat]], [[Raccoon]], [[Virginia Opossum]], [[rabbit]], [[squirrel]], [[Red Fox|Red]] and [[Gray Fox]]es, and [[Long-tailed Weasel]]. [[Coypu]] and [[Nine-banded Armadillo]] have been introduced to the state and now also common.

Alabama’s birds include [[Golden Eagle|Golden]] and [[Bald Eagle]]s, [[Osprey]] and other [[hawk]]s, [[Northern Flicker|Yellow-shafted Flickers]], and [[Black-and-white Warbler]]s. Game birds include [[Bobwhite Quail]], [[duck]], [[Wild Turkey]], and [[goose]]. Freshwater fish such as [[bream]], [[shad]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], and [[Catostomidae|sucker]] are common. Along the Gulf Coast there are seasonal runs of [[Tarpon]], [[pompano]], [[Red drum]], and [[bonito]].&lt;ref name = &quot;gale&quot;&gt;{{Citation

==Climate and soil==
{{Main|Climate of Alabama}}
The [[climate]] of Alabama is [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]].&lt;ref name=report&gt;[http://nsstc.uah.edu/alclimatereport/ The Alabama Climate Report] Volume1, Number 1  October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The heat of summer is tempered in the south by the winds from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and in the north by the elevation above the sea. The average annual temperature is highest in the southwest along the coast, and lowest in the northeast among the highlands. Thus at Mobile the annual mean is 67 °F (19 °C), the mean for the summer 81 °F (27 °C), and for the winter 52 °F (11 °C); and at Valley Head, in De Kalb county, the annual mean is 59 °F (15 °C), the mean for the summer 75 °F (24 °C), and for the winter 41 °F (5 °C). At Montgomery, in the central region, the average annual temperature is 66 °F (19 °C), with a winter average of 49 °F (9 °C), and a summer average of 81 °F (27 °C). The average winter minimum for the entire state is 35 °F (2 °C), and there is an average of 35 days in each year in which the thermometer falls below the freezing-point. At extremely rare intervals the thermometer has fallen below zero (-18 °C), as was the case in the remarkable cold wave of the 12th-13 February 1899, when an absolute minimum of -17 °F (-29 °C) was registered at [[Valley Head, Alabama|Valley Head]]. The highest temperature ever recorded was 109 °F (43 °C) in [[Talladega County, Alabama|Talladega]] county in 1902.

The amount of precipitation is greatest along the coast (62&amp;nbsp;inches/1,574&amp;nbsp;mm) and evenly distributed through the rest of the state (about 52&amp;nbsp;inches/1,320&amp;nbsp;mm). During each winter there is usually one fall of snow in the south and two in the north; but the snow quickly disappears, and sometimes, during an entire winter, the ground is not covered with snow.  Heavy snowfall can occur, such as during the [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. [[Hail]]storms occur occasionally in the spring and summer, but are seldom destructive. Heavy [[fog]]s are rare, and are confined chiefly to the coast. [[Thunderstorm]]s occur throughout the year - they are most common in the summer, but most severe in the spring and fall, when destructive winds and [[tornado]]es occasionally occur. The prevailing winds are from the news. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricanes]] are quite common in the state, especially in the southern part, and major hurricanes occasionally strike the coast which can be very destructive.

As regards its soil, Alabama may be divided into four regions.  Extending from the Gulf northward for about 150 miles (240&amp;nbsp;km) is the outer belt of the Coastal Plain, also called the ''Timber Belt,'' whose soil is sandy and poor, but responds well to fertilization.  North of this is the inner lowland of the Coastal Plain, or the ''Black Prairie,'' which includes some {{convert|13000|sqmi|km2|-3}} and seventeen counties.  It receives its name from its soil (weathered from the weak underlying limestone), which is black in colour, almost destitute of sand and loam, and rich in limestone and marl formations, especially adapted to the production of cotton; hence the region is also called the ''Cotton Belt.'' Between the ''Cotton Belt'' and the [[Tennessee Valley]] is the [[mineral]] region, the ''Old Land'' area—a region of resistant rocks—whose soils, also derived from weathering in silu, are of varied fertility, the best coming from the granites, sandstones and limestones, the poorest from the gneisses, schists and slates.  North of the mineral region is the ''Cereal Belt,'' embracing the Tennessee Valley and the counties beyond, whose richest soils are the red clays and dark loams of the river valley; north of which are less fertile soils, produced by siliceous and sandstone formations.

==Wetumpka Meteor Crater==
{{main|Wetumpka crater}}

Wetumpka is the home of &quot;Alabama's greatest natural disaster.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;nfqpzf&quot;&gt;[http://www.wetumpkalibrary.com/Default.asp?ID=207 &quot;Wetumpka Impact Crater&quot;] Wetumpka Public Library, accessed Aug. 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  A {{convert|1000|ft|m|-2|sing=on}}-wide&lt;ref name = &quot;nfqpzf&quot;/&gt; meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago. The hills just east of downtown showcase the eroded remains of the five mile (8&amp;nbsp;km) wide impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the [[Wetumpka crater]] or astrobleme (&quot;star-wound&quot;) for the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock can be found beneath the surface.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Wetumpka Astrobleme&quot; by John C. Hall, Alabama Heritage, Fall 1996, Number 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as an internationally recognized impact crater.&lt;ref name = &quot;nfqpzf&quot;/&gt;

==Public lands==
Alabama includes several types of public use lands. These include four national forests and one national preserve within state borders that provide over 25% of the state's public recreation land.

The [[Governor of Alabama]] is the head of the executive branch of [[Alabama]]'s government and the commander-in-chief of the [[U.S. state|state's]] [[Alabama National Guard|military forces]]. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws and the power to either approve or [[veto]] bills passed by the [[Alabama Legislature]], to convene the legislature, and to grant [[pardon]]s, except in cases of impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;AL Const. art. V&lt;/ref&gt;

There have officially been 53 governors of the state of Alabama; this official numbering skips acting and military governors.&lt;ref name=&quot;adah&quot; /&gt; In addition, the first governor, [[William Wyatt Bibb]], served as the only governor of [[Alabama Territory]]. Five people have served as acting governor, bringing the total number of people serving as governor to 58, spread over 63 distinct terms. Four governors have served multiple non-consecutive terms: [[Bibb Graves]], [[Jim Folsom]], and [[Fob James]] each served two, and [[George Wallace]] served three non-consecutive periods. Officially, these non-consecutive terms are numbered only with the number of their first term. [[William D. Jelks]] also served non-consecutive terms, but his first term was in an acting capacity. The longest-serving governor was George Wallace, who served sixteen years over four terms. The shortest term for a non-acting governor was that of [[Hugh McVay]], who served four and a half months after replacing the resigning [[Clement Comer Clay]]. [[Lurleen Wallace]], wife of George Wallace, was the first and so far only woman to serve as governor of Alabama, and the third woman to serve as governor of any state. The current governor is Republican [[Robert J. Bentley]], who took office on January 17, 2011.

===Governor of the Territory of Alabama===

:''For the period before Alabama Territory was formed, see the [[list of Governors of Mississippi|list of Governors of Mississippi Territory]].''
[[Alabama Territory]] was formed on March 3, 1817 from [[Mississippi Territory]]. It had only one governor appointed by the [[President of the United States]] before it became a state; he became the first state governor.

===Governors of the State of Alabama===

Alabama was [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|admitted to the Union]] on December 14, 1819. It seceded from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] on January 11, 1861 and was a founding member of the [[Confederate States of America]] on February 4, 1861; there was no Union government in exile, so there was a single line of governors. Following the end of the [[American Civil War]] during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], it was part of the [[Third Military District]], which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. Alabama was readmitted to the Union on July 14, 1868.

The first [[Alabama Constitution]], ratified in 1819, provided that a governor be elected every two years, limited to serve no more than four out of every six years.&lt;ref&gt;1819 Const. art. IV, § 4&lt;/ref&gt; This limit remained in place until the constitution of 1868, which simply allowed governors to serve terms of two years.&lt;ref&gt;1868 Const. art. V, § 2&lt;/ref&gt; The current constitution of 1901 increased terms to four years,&lt;ref&gt;AL Const. art. V, § 114&lt;/ref&gt; but prohibited governors from succeeding themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;const-art5sec116&quot;&gt;AL Const. art. V, § 116&lt;/ref&gt; Amendment 282 to the constitution, passed in 1968, allowed governors to succeed themselves once.&lt;ref&gt;AL Const. amendment 282&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution had no set date for the commencement of a governor's term until 1901, when it was set at the first Monday after the second Tuesday in the January following an election.&lt;ref name=&quot;const-art5sec116&quot; /&gt;

The office of [[lieutenant governor]] was created in 1868,&lt;ref name=&quot;1868const-art5sec1&quot;&gt;1868 Const. art. V, § 1&lt;/ref&gt; abolished in 1875,&lt;ref name=&quot;1875const-art5sec1&quot;&gt;1875 Const. art. V, § 1&lt;/ref&gt; and recreated in 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;const-art5sec112&quot;&gt;AL Const. art. V, § 112&lt;/ref&gt; According to the current constitution, should the governor be out of the state for more than 20 days, the lieutenant governor becomes [[acting governor]], and if the office of governor becomes vacant the lieutenant governor fully becomes governor.&lt;ref&gt;AL Const. art. V, § 127&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier constitutions said the powers of the governor devolved upon the successor, rather than them necessarily becoming governor,&lt;ref&gt;1819 Const. art. IV, § 18; 1861 Const. art. IV, § 18; 1865 Const. art V, § 19; 1868 Const. art. V, § 15; 1875 Const. art. V § 15&lt;/ref&gt; but the official listing includes these as full governors.&lt;ref name=&quot;adah&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.archives.state.al.us/govslist.html | title=Alabama Governors | publisher=[[Alabama Department of Archives and History]] | accessdate=July 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governor and lieutenant governor are not elected on the same [[ticket (election)|ticket]].

Alabama was a strongly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state before the Civil War, electing only candidates from the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] and Democratic parties. It had two [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governors following Reconstruction, but after the Democratic Party re-established control, 112 years passed before voters chose another Republican.

==Other high offices held==

Eighteen of Alabama's governors have served higher federal or [[Confederate States of America|confederate]] offices. All but three were elected to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], although one of those represented only [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The remaining three served in the confederate government, two as members of the [[Provisional Confederate Congress]], and one was the [[Confederate States Attorney General]]. One governor served as [[United States Ambassador to Russia|Minister to Russia]]. Two governors (marked with *) resigned to take seats in the Senate, and two (marked with {{dagger}}) resigned their positions to take office as governor. 

Additionally, two governors were elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] shortly after the [[American Civil War]], but were did not take office: Lewis E. Parsons was refused his seat because Alabama had not yet been [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstructed]], and John A. Winston would not take the oath of allegiance.

All representatives and senators listed represented Alabama except where noted.

{{Redirect|apocryphal|the adjective|wiktionary:apocryphal}}

The term '''''apocrypha''''' is used with various meanings, including &quot;hidden&quot;, &quot;esoteric&quot;, &quot;spurious&quot;, &quot;of questionable authenticity&quot;, ancient Chinese &quot;revealed texts and objects&quot; and &quot;Christian texts that are not [[canonical]]&quot;.

The word is originally [[Greek language|Greek]] ({{Polytonic|ἀπόκρυφα}}) and means &quot;those having been hidden away&quot;. Specifically, {{Polytonic|ἀπόκρυφα}} is the neuter plural of ἀπόκρυφος, a participle derived from the verb ἀποκρύπτω [infinitive: ἀποκρύπτειν], &quot;to hide something away.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apocrypha&lt;/ref&gt;

The general term is usually applied to the books that the [[Protestant]] [[Christian Church]] considered useful but not [[divinely inspired]].  As such, it is misleading in this sense to refer to the [[Gospel according to the Hebrews]] or [[Gnostic]] writings as apocryphal, because they would not be classified in the same category by orthodox believers. Non-[[canonical]] books are texts of uncertain authenticity, or writings where the work is seriously questioned.  Given that different denominations have different beliefs about what constitutes canonical [[scripture]], there are several versions of the apocrypha.

During 16th-century controversies about the [[biblical canon]], the word acquired a negative connotation, and has become a [[synonym]] for &quot;spurious&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. This usage usually involves fictitious or legendary accounts that are plausible enough to be commonly considered true. For example, [[Laozi]]'s alleged authorship of the [[Tao Te Ching]] and the [[Parson Weems]] account of [[George Washington]] and the [[cherry]] tree are considered apocryphal. 

== Definitions and usage==
''Apocrypha'' has evolved in meaning somewhat, and its associated implications have ranged from positive to [[pejorative]]. ''Apocrypha'', according to [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]], means &quot;books included in the [[Septuagint]] and [[Vulgate]] but excluded from the Jewish and Protestant canons of the Old Testament.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apocrypha Apocrypha]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Esoteric writings and objects===
The word &quot;apocryphal&quot; ({{Polytonic|ἀπόκρυφος}}) was first applied, in a positive sense, to writings which were kept secret because they were the vehicles of [[esoteric]] knowledge considered too profound or too sacred to be disclosed to anyone other than the initiated.  For example, it is used in this sense to describe ''A Holy and Secret Book of Moses, called Eighth, or Moyseos holy books citing esoteric eighth St ({{Polytonic|Μωυσέως ἱερὰ βίβλος ἀπόκρυφος ἐπικαλούμενη ὀγδόη ἢ ἁγία}}''). This is a text taken from a [[Leiden University Library|Leiden papyrus]] of the third or fourth century AD. The text may be as old as the first century, but other proof of age has not been found. In a similar vein, the [[Apprenticeship|disciples]] of the [[Gnostic]] [[Prodicus]] boasted that they possessed the secret ({{Polytonic|ἀπόκρυφα}}) books of [[Zoroaster]]. The term in general enjoyed high consideration among the [[Gnostics]] (see [[Acts of Thomas]], 10, 27, 44).&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{harvnb| Charles|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned Sinologist [[Anna Seidel]] refers to texts and even items produced by ancient Chinese sages as apocryphal and studied their uses during Six Dynasties China (220 to 589 AD).  These artifacts were used as symbols legitimizing and guaranteeing the Emperor's [[Mandate of Heaven|Heavenly Mandate]].  Examples of these include talismans, charts, writs, tallies, and registers.  The first examples were stones, jade pieces, bronze vessels and weapons, but came to include talismans and magic diagrams&lt;ref&gt;Seidel, Anna.  &quot;Imperial treasures and Taoist sacraments&quot;, in M. Strickmann, ed., Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honor of Rolf A. Stein, II, Bruxelles, Institut belge des hautes etudes chinoises.  291-371. &lt;/ref&gt;.  From their roots in [[Zhou]] era China (1066 to 256 BC) these items came to be surpassed in value by texts by the [[Han]] dynasty (206 BC to 220 CE). Most of these texts have been destroyed as Emperors, particularly during the [[Han dynasty]], collected these legitimizing objects and proscribed, forbade and burnt nearly all of them to prevent them from falling into the hands of political rivals.  &lt;ref&gt;Seidel, Anna.  &quot;Imperial treasures and Taoist sacraments&quot;, in M. Strickmann, ed., Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honor of Rolf A. Stein, II, Bruxelles, Institut belge des hautes etudes chinoises.  291-371. &lt;/ref&gt;It is therefore fitting with the Greek root of the word, as these texts were obviously hidden away to protect the ruling Emperor from challenges to his status as Heaven's choice as sovereign.

=== Writings of questionable value ===&lt;!-- This was originally part of the Esoteric writing section, but it does not seem to fit. It seems to be a separate topic --&gt;
&quot;Apocrypha&quot; was also applied to writings that were hidden not because of their divinity but because of their questionable value to the church. Many in [[Protestant]] traditions cite Revelation 22:18-19 as a potential curse for those who attach any canonical authority to extra-biblical writings such as the Apocrypha. However, a strict exegesis of this text would indicate it was meant for only the [[Book of Revelation]]. Rv.22:18-19f. (KJV) states:  &quot;For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.&quot;  In this case, if one holds to a strict [[hermeneutic]], the &quot;words of the [[prophecy]]&quot; do not refer to the Bible as a whole but to Jesus' ''Revelation'' to John. [[Origen]], in ''Commentaries on Matthew'', distinguishes between writings which were read by the churches and apocryphal writings: {{Polytonic|γραφὴ μὴ φερομένη μέν ἒν τοῖς κοινοῖς καὶ δεδημοσιευμένοις βιβλίοις εἰκὸς δ' ὅτι ἒν ἀποκρύφοις φερομένη}} (''writing not found on the common and published books in one hand, actually found on the secret ones on the other'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1016.htm ''Commentaries on Matthew'', X. 18, XIII. 57]{{Nonspecific|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of αποκρυφος is here practically equivalent to &quot;excluded from the public use of the church&quot;, and prepares the way for an even less favourable use of the word.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;

=== Spurious writings ===
In general use, the word &quot;apocrypha&quot; came to mean &quot;false, spurious, bad, or heretical.&quot; This meaning also appears in Origen's prologue to his commentary on the [[Song of Songs]], of which only the [[Latin]] translation survives: ''De scripturis his, quae appellantur apocryphae, pro eo quod multa in iis corrupta et contra fidem veram inveniuntur a majoribus tradita non placuit iis dari locum nec admitti ad auctoritatem.''&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; &quot;Concerning these scriptures, which are called apocryphal, for the reason that many things are found in them corrupt and against the true faith handed down by the elders, it has pleased them that they not be given a place nor be admitted to authority.&quot; 

=== Other meanings ===
Other uses of ''apocrypha'' developed over the history of Western Christianity.  The [[Gelasian Decree]] refers to religious works by [[church fathers]] [[Eusebius]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] as apocrypha. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] defined the word as meaning simply &quot;obscurity of origin,&quot; implying that any book of unknown authorship or questionable authenticity would be considered as apocrypha. On the other hand, [[Jerome]] (in ''Protogus Galeatus'') declared that all books outside the Hebrew canon were apocryphal.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; In practice, Jerome treated some books outside the Hebrew canon as if they were canonical, and the Western Church did not accept Jerome's definition of apocrypha, instead retaining the word's prior meaning (''see: [[Deuterocanon]]''). As a result, various church authorities labeled different books as apocrypha, treating them with varying levels of regard. 

Some apocryphal books were included in the [[Septuagint]] with little distinction made between them and the rest of the [[Old Testament]]. [[Origen]], [[Clement]] and others cited some apocryphal books as &quot;scripture,&quot; &quot;divine scripture,&quot; &quot;inspired,&quot; and the like. On the other hand, teachers connected with [[Palestine]] and familiar with the [[protocanonical books|Hebrew canon]] excluded from the canon all of the Old Testament not found there. This view is reflected in the canon of [[Melito of Sardis]], and in the prefaces and letters of Jerome.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; A third view was that the books were not as valuable as the canonical scriptures of the [[Hebrew]] collection, but were of value for moral uses, as introductory texts for new converts from [[paganism]], and to be read in congregations. They were referred to as &quot;[[ecclesiastical]]&quot; works by [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]].&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;  

These three opinions regarding the apocryphal books prevailed until the [[Protestant Reformation]], when the idea of what constitutes canon became a matter of primary concern for [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Protestant]]s alike. In 1546 the Catholic [[Council of Trent]] reconfirmed the canon of Augustine, dating to the second and third centuries, declaring &quot;He is also to be anathema who does not receive these entire books, with all their parts, as they have been accustomed to be read in the Catholic Church, and are found in the ancient editions of the Latin [[Vulgate]], as sacred and canonical.&quot; The whole of the books in question, with the exception of [[1 Esdras]] and [[2 Esdras]] and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], were declared canonical at Trent.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; The Protestants, in comparison, were diverse in their opinion of the deuterocanon. Some considered them divinely inspired, others rejected them. Anglicans took a position between the Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches; they kept them as Christian intertestamental readings and a part of the Bible, but no doctrine should be based on them. [[John Wycliffe]], a 14th century Christian Humanist, had declared in his biblical translation that &quot;whatever book is in the Old Testament besides these twenty-five shall be set among the apocrypha, that is, without authority or belief.&quot;&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt; Nevertheless, his translation of the Bible included the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]] and the Epistle of the Laodiceans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/wycliffe/ Wyclif's Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;

The respect accorded to apocryphal books varied between Protestant denominations. In both the [[Luther Bible|German]] (1534) and [[Coverdale Bible|English]] (1535) translations of the Bible, the apocrypha are published in a separate section from the other books, although the Lutheran and Anglican lists are different. In some editions (like the Westminster), readers were warned that these books were not &quot;to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings.&quot; A milder distinction was expressed elsewhere, such as in the &quot;argument&quot; introducing them in the [[Geneva Bible]], and in the Sixth Article of the [[Church of England]], where it is said that &quot;the other books the church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners,&quot; though not to establish doctrine.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;

According to the [[Orthodox Anglican Church]]:

{{quote|On the other hand, the Anglican Communion emphatically maintains that the Apocrypha is part of the Bible and is to be read with respect by her members. Two of the hymns used in the American Prayer Book office of Morning Prayer, the Benedictus es and Benedicite, are taken from the Apocrypha. One of the offertory sentences in Holy Communion comes from an apocryphal book (Tob. 4: 8-9). Lessons from the Apocrypha are regularly appointed to be read in the daily, Sunday, and special services of Morning and Evening Prayer. There are altogether 111 such lessons in the latest revised American Prayer Book Lectionary [The books used are: II Esdras, Tobit, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, Three Holy Children, and I Maccabees.] The position of the Church is best summarized in the words of Article Six of the Thirty-nine Articles: “In the name of Holy Scripture we do understand those canonical Books of the Old and New Testament, of whose authority there was never any doubt in the Church… And the other Books (as Hierome [St. Jerome] saith) the Church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine…”|{{Citation needed|date=March 2010|reason=dead link:  http://www.orthodoxanglican.net/downloads/apocrypha.PDF ''The Apocrypha, Bridge of the Testaments'' }} }}

==Texts==
===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish apocrypha}}
Although traditional rabbinical Judaism insists on the exclusive canonization of the current 24 books in the [[Tanakh]], it also claims to have an oral law handed down from [[Moses]]. The [[Sadducees]] - unlike the [[Pharisees]] but like the [[Samaritans]] - seem to have maintained an earlier and smaller number of texts as canonical, preferring to hold to only what was written in the Law of Moses&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=40&amp;letter=S&amp;search=Sadducees Jewish Encyclopedia: Sadducees]&lt;/ref&gt; (making most of the presently accepted canon, both Jewish and Christian, ''apocryphal'' in their eyes). Certain circles in Judaism, such as the [[Essene]]s in Judea and the [[Therapeutae]] in [[Egypt]], were said to have a secret literature (see [[Dead Sea scrolls]]). Other traditions maintained different customs regarding canonicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/sbrandt/canon.htm The Old Testament Canon]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopic Jews, for instance, seem to have retained a spread of canonical texts similar to the Ethiopian [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gbgm-umc.org/UMW/BIBLE/ethold.stm Ethiopian Orthodox Old Testament]&lt;/ref&gt; cf ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', Vol 6, p 1147. A large part of this literature consisted of the apocalypses. Based on prophecies, these apocalyptic books were not considered scripture by all, but rather part of a literary form that flourished from 200 BC to AD 100.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

{{Main|Biblical apocrypha}}
{{seealso|Intertestamental period}}
During the [[Apostolic Age|birth of Christianity]], some of the Jewish apocrypha that dealt with the coming of the Messianic kingdom became popular in the rising [[Jewish Christian]] communities. Occasionally these writings were changed or added to, but on the whole it was found sufficient to reinterpret them as conforming to a [[New Covenant|Christian viewpoint]]. Christianity eventually gave birth to new apocalyptic works, some of which were derived from traditional Jewish sources. Some of the Jewish apocrypha were part of the ordinary religious literature of the [[Early Christians]]. This was not strange, as the large majority of Old Testament references in the New Testament are taken from the Greek [[Septuagint]], which is the source of the [[deuterocanonical books]]&lt;ref&gt;''Deuterocanonical books'' literally means books of the second canon. The term was coined in the 16th century.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as most of the other [[biblical apocrypha]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''Style Manual for the Society of Biblical Literature'' recommends the use of the term ''deuterocanonical literature'' instead of ''apocrypha'' in academic writing, although not all apocryphal books are properly deuterocanonical.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Slightly varying collections of additional Books (called deuterocanonical by the Roman Catholic Church) form part of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]] canons. See [[Development of the Old Testament canon]].

The [[Book of Enoch]] is included in the biblical canon only of the [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches of Ethiopia and Eritrea.  The [[Epistle of Jude]] quotes the book of Enoch, and some believe the use of this book also appears in the four gospels and [[1 Peter]]. The genuineness and inspiration of Enoch were believed in by the writer of the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] and much of the early church. The epistles of Paul and the gospels also show influences from the [[Book of Jubilees]], which is part of the Ethiopian canon, as well as the [[Assumption of Moses]] and the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]], which are included in no biblical canon.

The high position which some apocryphal books occupied in the first two centuries was undermined by a variety of influences in the Christian church. All claims to the possession of a secret tradition (as held by many [[Gnostic]] sects) were denied by the influential theologians like [[Irenaeus]] and [[Tertullian]], which modern historians refer to as the [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|Proto-orthodox]], the timeframe of true inspiration was limited to the apostolic age, and universal acceptance by the church was required as proof of apostolic authorship. As these principles gained currency, books deemed apocryphal tended to become regarded as spurious and heretical writings, though books now considered deuterocanonical have been used in liturgy and theology from the first century to the present.

===Christianity===
{{Main|New Testament apocrypha}}
[[New Testament apocrypha]]—books similar to those in the [[New Testament]] but almost universally rejected by Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants—include several gospels and lives of apostles. Some were written by early Jewish Christians (see the [[Gospel according to the Hebrews]]). Others of these were  produced by [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] authors or members of other groups later defined as [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]]. Many texts believed lost for centuries were unearthed in the 19th and 20th centuries, producing lively speculation about their importance in early [[Christianity]] among religious scholars, while many others survive only in the form of quotations from them in other writings; for some, no more than the title is known. Artists and theologians have drawn upon the New Testament apocrypha for such matters as the names of [[Dismas]] and [[Gestas]] and details about the [[Three Wise Men]]. The first explicit mention of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is found in the pseudepigraphical [[Infancy Gospel of James]].

The [[Gnosticism|Gnostic tradition]] was a prolific source of apocryphal gospels. While these writings borrowed the characteristic poetic features of apocalyptic literature from Judaism, Gnostic sects largely insisted on allegorical interpretations based on a secret apostolic tradition. With them, these apocryphal books were highly esteemed. A well-known Gnostic apocryphal book is the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the only complete text of which was found in the Egyptian town of [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1945. The [[Gospel of Judas]], a Gnostic gospel, also received much media attention when it was reconstructed in 2006.

Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians as well as Protestants generally agree on the canon of the [[New Testament]], see [[Development of the New Testament canon]]. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] have in the past also included [[Epistles of Clement|I &amp; II Clement]] and [[Shepherd of Hermas]] in their [[New Testament]] canon.

===Taoism===

Prophetic texts called the ''Ch'an-wei'' were written by [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC to 220 CE) Taoist priests to legitimize as well as curb imperial power&lt;ref&gt;Seidel, Anna.  &quot;Imperial treasures and Taoist sacraments&quot;, in M. Strickmann, ed., Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honor of Rolf A. Stein, II, Bruxelles, Institut belge des hautes etudes chinoises.  291-371. &lt;/ref&gt;.  They deal with treasure objects that were part of the [[Zhou]] (1066 to 256 BC) royal treasures.  Emerging from the instability of the [[Warring States]] Period (476-221 BC), ancient Chinese scholars saw the centralized rule of the [[Zhou]] as an ideal model for the new Han empire to emulate.  The ''Ch'an-wei'' are therefore texts written by Han scholars about the [[Zhou]] royal treasures, only they were not written to record history for its own sake, but for legitimizing the current imperial reign.  These texts took the form of stories about texts and objects being conferred upon the Emperors by Heaven and comprising these ancient sage-king's (this is how the [[Zhou]] emperors were referred to by this time, about 500 years after their peak) royal regalia&lt;ref&gt;Seidel, Anna.  &quot;Imperial treasures and Taoist sacraments&quot;, in M. Strickmann, ed., Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honor of Rolf A. Stein, II, Bruxelles, Institut belge des hautes etudes chinoises.  291-371. &lt;/ref&gt;.  The desired effect was to confirm the Han emperor's [[Mandate of Heaven|Heavenly Mandate]] through the continuity offered by his possession of these same sacred talismans.  It is because of this politicized recording of their history that it is difficult to retrace the exact origins of these objects.  What is known is that these texts were most likely produced by a class of literati called the ''Fang-Shih''.  These were a class of nobles who were not part of the state administration; there were considered specialists or occultists, for example diviners, astrologers, alchemists or healers&lt;ref&gt;Seidel, Anna.  &quot;Imperial treasures and Taoist sacraments&quot;, in M. Strickmann, ed., Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honor of Rolf A. Stein, II, Bruxelles, Institut belge des hautes etudes chinoises.  291-371. &lt;/ref&gt;. It is from this class of nobles that the first [[Taoist]] priests are believed to have emerged. [[Seidel]] points out however that the scarcity of sources relating to the formation of the early [[Taoist]] church make the exact link between the apocryphal texts and the Taoist church unclear.  &lt;ref&gt;Seidel, Anna.  &quot;Imperial treasures and Taoist sacraments&quot;, in M. Strickmann, ed., Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honor of Rolf A. Stein, II, Bruxelles, Institut belge des hautes etudes chinoises.  291-371.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--[[Image:Antarctica 6400px from Blue Marble.jpg|thumb|right|A satellite composite image of Antarctica.]]--&gt;
The '''Antarctic Treaty''' and related agreements, collectively called the '''Antarctic Treaty System''' or '''ATS''', regulate [[international relations]] with respect to [[Antarctica]], Earth's only continent without a native human population. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all of the land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of [[60th parallel south|60°S latitude]]. The treaty, entering into force in 1961 and eventually signed by 45 countries, sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans [[Military activity in the Antarctic|military activity on that continent]]. The treaty was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]]. The [[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]] headquarters have been located in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, since September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ats.aq/index_e.htm ATS.aq]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Antarctic Treaty System==
{{International ownership conventions}}

The main treaty was opened for signature on December 1, 1959, and officially entered into force on June 23, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204
|title=Information about the Antarctic Treaty and how Antarctica is governed.
|accessdate=February 6, 2011
|date=December 28, 2005
|publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original signatories were the 12 countries active in Antarctica during the [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) of 1957–58 and willing to accept a US invitation to the conference at which the treaty was negotiated. The 12 countries had significant interests in Antarctica at the time: [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Chile]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[South Africa]], the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. These countries had established over 50 Antarctic stations for the IGY. The treaty was a diplomatic expression of the operational and scientific cooperation that had been achieved &quot;on the ice&quot;.

===Articles of the Antarctic Treaty===
*'''Article 1''' – The area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited but military personnel and equipment may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose;
*'''Article 2''' – Freedom of scientific investigations and cooperation shall continue;
*'''Article 3''' – Free exchange of information and personnel in cooperation with the [[United Nations]] and other international agencies;
*'''Article 4''' – The treaty does not recognize, dispute, nor establish territorial sovereignty claims; no new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force;
*'''Article 5''' – The treaty prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes;
*'''Article 6''' – Includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves but not the surrounding waters south of [[60th parallel south|60 degrees 00 minutes south]];
*'''Article 7''' – Treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial observation, to any area and may inspect all stations, installations, and equipment; advance notice of all activities and of the introduction of military personnel must be given;
*'''Article 8''' – Allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own states;
*'''Article 9''' – Frequent consultative meetings take place among member nations;
*'''Article 10''' – All treaty states will discourage activities by any country in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty;
*'''Article 11''' – All disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or, ultimately, by the [[International Court of Justice]];
*'''Articles 12, 13, 14''' – Deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved nations.

The main objective of the ATS is to ensure &lt;cite&gt;in the interests of all humankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord&lt;/cite&gt;. The treaty forbids &lt;cite&gt;any measures of a military nature&lt;/cite&gt;, but not the presence of military personnel.

===Other agreements===
[[Image:Antarctica, pollution, environment, Russia, Bellingshausen 1.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Disposal of waste by simply dumping it at the shoreline such as here at the Russian [[Bellingshausen Island|Bellingshausen]] base is no longer permitted by the Protocol on Environmental Protection]]
[[Image:Cover AAT 1959.jpg|right|300px|thumb|This 1959 cover commemorated the opening of the Wilkes post office in the Australian Antarctic Territory.]]

Other agreements&amp;nbsp;— some 200 recommendations adopted at treaty consultative meetings and ratified by governments&amp;nbsp;— include:
*[[Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora]] (1964) (entered into force in 1982)
*The [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals]] (1972)
*The [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (1980)
*The [[Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities]] (1988) (signed in 1988, not in force)
*The [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] was signed October 4, 1991 and entered into force January 14, 1998; this agreement prevents development and provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment through five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna and flora, [[environmental impact assessment]]s, waste management, and protected areas. It prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources except scientific. A sixth annex&amp;nbsp;— on liability arising from environmental emergencies&amp;nbsp;— was adopted in 2005 but is yet to enter into force.

==Meetings==
The Antarctic Treaty System's yearly ''Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM)'' are the international forum for the administration and management of the region. Only 28 of the 46 parties to the agreements have the right to participate in decision-making at these meetings, though the other 18 are still allowed to attend. The decision-making participants are the ''Consultative Parties'' and, in addition to the 12 original signatories, include 16 countries that have demonstrated their interest in Antarctica by carrying out substantial scientific activity there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ats.aq/ Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Claims overlap.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; Reserved the right to claim areas.

{{As of|2007|alt=Currently}}, there are 46 treaty member nations: 28 consultative and 18 acceding. Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica as national territory. The 21 non-claimant nations either do not recognize the claims of others, or have not stated their positions.

==Antarctic Treaty Secretariat==
The [[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]] was established in Buenos Aires, Argentina in September 2004 by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM). Mr. Jan Huber (from the Netherlands) served as the first Executive Secretary for five years until August 31, 2009. He was succeeded on September 1, 2009 by Mr. Manfred Reinke (Germany), appointed for a four-year term.

The tasks of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat can be divided into the following areas:
*Supporting the annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) and the meeting of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP).
*Facilitating the exchange of information between the Parties required in the Treaty and the Environment Protocol.
*Collecting, storing, arranging and publishing the documents of the ATCM.
*Providing and disseminating public information about the Antarctic Treaty system and Antarctic activities.

==Legal system==
Antarctica has no permanent population and hence no citizenship or government. All personnel present on Antarctica at any time are citizens or nationals of some sovereignty outside of Antarctica, as there is no Antarctic sovereignty. The majority of Antarctica is claimed by one or more countries, but most countries do not explicitly recognize those claims. The area on the mainland between [[90th meridian west|90 degrees west]] and [[150th meridian west|150 degrees west]], combined with the interior of the Norwegian Sector (the extent of which has never been officially defined){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, is the only major land on Earth not claimed by any country.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Minturn, &quot;The Ownership of Antarctica, Its Living and Mineral Resources&quot;, ''Journal of Law and the Environment'' 4 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments that are party to the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection implement the articles of these agreements, and decisions taken under them, through national laws. These laws generally apply only to their own citizens, wherever they are in Antarctica, and serve to enforce the consensus decisions of the consultative parties: about which activities are acceptable, which areas require permits to enter, what processes of environmental impact assessment must precede activities, and so on. The Antarctic Treaty is often considered to represent an example of the [[Common heritage of mankind]] principle.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Frakes, The Common Heritage of Mankind Principle and the Deep Seabed, Outer Space, and Antarctica: Will Developed and Developing Nations Reach a Compromise? Wisconsin International Law Journal. 2003; 21:409&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
According to Argentine regulations, any crime committed within 50 kilometers of any Argentine base is to be judged in [[Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego|Ushuaia]] (as capital of [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica, and South Atlantic Islands]]). In the part of [[Argentine Antarctica]] that is also claimed by Chile and UK, the person to be judged can ask to be transferred there.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Australia===
Since the designation of the Australian Antarctic Territory pre-dated the signing of the Antarctic Treaty, some of the complex suite of Australian laws that relate to Antarctica date from more than two decades before the Antarctic Treaty era. In terms of criminal law, the laws that apply to the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] (which follows the laws of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]) apply to the Australian Antarctic Territory. Key Australian legislation applying Antarctic Treaty System decisions include the ''Antarctic Treaty Act 1960'', the ''Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980'' and the ''Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=3358 Australian Antarctic Division – Australian environmental law and guidelines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[law of the United States]], including certain criminal offenses by or against U.S. nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under jurisdiction of other countries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} To this end, the United States now stations special deputy [[United States Marshal|U.S. Marshals]] in Antarctica to provide a law enforcement presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmarshals.gov/history/antarctica/ Marshals and Antarctica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some U.S. laws directly apply to Antarctica. For example, the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]], Public Law 95-541 , {{UnitedStatesCode|16|2401}} ''et seq.'', provides civil and criminal penalties for the following activities, unless authorized by regulation or [[statute]]:
*the taking of native Antarctic mammals or birds
*the introduction into Antarctica of non-indigenous plants and animals
*entry into specially protected or scientific areas
*the discharge or disposal of pollutants into Antarctica or Antarctic waters
*the importation into the U.S. of certain items from Antarctica

Violation of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to US$10,000 in fines and one year in prison. The Departments of [[United States Department of the Treasury|the Treasury]], [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce]], [[United States Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and [[United States Department of the Interior|the Interior]] share enforcement responsibilities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The Act requires expeditions from the U.S. to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the [[Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs]] of the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], which reports such plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Further information is provided by the [[Office of Polar Programs]] of the [[National Science Foundation]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===New Zealand===
In 2006, the New Zealand police reported that jurisdictional issues prevented them issuing warrants for potential American witnesses who were reluctant to testify during the Christchurch Coroner's investigation into the death by poisoning of Australian astrophysicist [[Rodney Marks (astrophysicist)|Rodney Marks]] at the [[South Pole]] base in May 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;stuffSunday&quot;&gt;Hotere, Andrea.

Retrieved on December 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Marks died while wintering over at the United States' [[Amundsen&amp;ndash;Scott South Pole Station]] located at the geographic [[South Pole]]. Prior to autopsy, the death was attributed to natural causes by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the contractor administering the base. However, an autopsy in New Zealand revealed that Dr. Marks died from [[methanol]] poisoning. The [[New Zealand Police]] launched an investigation. In 2006, frustrated by lack of progress, the [[Christchurch]] Coroner said that it was unlikely that Dr. Marks ingested the methanol knowingly, although there is no certainty that he died as the direct result of the act of another person. During media interviews, the police detective in charge of the investigation criticized the National Science Foundation and contractor [[Raytheon]] for failing to co-operate with the investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;TelegraphChapman&quot;&gt;Chapman, Paul.

'''Alfred William Lawson''' (March 24, 1869 – November 29, 1954) was a professional [[baseball]] player, manager and league promoter from 1887 through 1916 and went on to play a pioneering role in the US aircraft industry, publishing two early aviation trade journals.  In 1904, he also wrote a novel, ''Born Again'', clearly inspired by the popular Utopian fantasy ''[[Looking Backward]]'' by [[Edward Bellamy]], an early harbinger of the metaphysical turn his career would take with the theory of '''Lawsonomy'''. He is frequently cited as the inventor of the [[airliner]] and was awarded several of the first air mail contracts, which he ultimately could not fulfill. He founded the Lawson Aircraft Company in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], Wisconsin, to build military training aircraft and later the Lawson Airplane Company in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], to build airliners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationhalloffamewisconsin.com/inductees/lawson.htm Aviation Hall of Fame, Wisconsin - Alfred W. Lawson]&lt;/ref&gt; The crash of his ambitious &quot;Midnight Liner&quot; during its trial flight takeoff on May 8, 1921, ended his best chance for commercial aviation success.

He made one start for the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] and two for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pittsburgh Alleghenys]] during the 1890 season. His minor league playing career lasted through 1895. He later managed in the minors from 1905-1907.

In 1908 he was involved in trying to start a new professional baseball league, the &quot;Union Professional League&quot; which took the field in April but folded one month later.

==Lawsonomy==
In the 1920s, he promoted health practices including [[vegetarianism]] and claimed to have found the secret of living to 200.  He also developed his own highly unusual theories of physics, according to which such concepts as &quot;penetrability&quot;, &quot;suction and pressure&quot; and &quot;zig-zag-and-swirl&quot; were discoveries on par with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]] | author = Martin Gardner  | pages = 69–79 | isbn = 978-0-486-20394-2 | publisher = Dover Publications | year = 1957| accessdate = 2008-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He published numerous books on these concepts, all set in a distinctive typography.  Lawson repeatedly  predicted the worldwide adoption of Lawsonian principles by the year 2000.

He later propounded his own philosophy—Lawsonomy—and the [[Lawsonian religion]]. He also developed, during the [[Great Depression]], the [[Populism|populist]] economic theory of &quot;[[Direct Credit]]s&quot;, according to which banks are the cause of all economic woe, the oppressors of both capital and labour. Lawson believed that the government should replace banks as the provider of loans to business and workers. His rallies and lectures attracted thousands of listeners in the early 30s, mainly in the upper Midwest, but by the late 30s the crowds had dwindled.

In 1943, he founded the unaccredited [[University of Lawsonomy]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] to spread his teachings and offer the degree of &quot;Knowledgian,&quot; but after various IRS and other investigations it was closed and finally sold in 1954, the year of Lawson's death.  Lawson's financial arrangements remain mysterious to this day, and in later years he seems to have owned little property, moving from city to city as a guest of his farflung acolytes. In 1952, he was brought before a [[United States Senate]] investigative committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,816203,00.html | work=Time | title=Education: Zigzag &amp; Swirl | date=March 24, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Gardner]] devoted an entire chapter of ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'' to Lawsonomy.

A farm near [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]], Wisconsin, is the only remaining university facility, although a tiny handful of churches may yet survive in places such as [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], Kansas.  The large sign, formerly reading &quot;University of Lawsonomy&quot;, was a familiar landmark for motorists in the region for many years and was visible from I-94 about 13 miles north of the Illinois state line, on the east side of the highway. Although the sign still exists, the &quot;of&quot; has now been replaced by the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of their website.  As of a storm in spring 2009, the sign is no longer there although the supporting posts are still visible.  Driving north on I-94 a sign on the roof of the building nearest the freeway says &quot;Study Natural Law.&quot;

=== Iowa State University ===
The [[Iowa State University]] of Science and Technology, more commonly known as Iowa State University (ISU), is a public [[land-grant universities|land-grant]] and [[space-grant colleges|space-grant]] research university located in Ames. Iowa State has produced a number of astronauts, scientists, [[Nobel laureates]], [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners, and a variety of other notable individuals in their respective fields.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Until 1945 it was known as the Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. The university is a member of the [[American Association of Universities]] and the [[Big 12 Conference]].

In 1856, the [[Iowa General Assembly]] enacted legislation to establish the State Agricultural College and Model Farm. [[Story County, Iowa|Story County]] was chosen as the location on June 21, 1859, from proposals by [[Johnson County, Iowa|Johnson]], [[Kossuth County, Iowa|Kossuth]], [[Marshall County, Iowa|Marshall]], [[Polk County, Iowa|Polk]], and [[Story County, Iowa|Story]] counties. When Iowa accepted the provisions of the [[Morrill Act of 1862]], Iowa State became the first institution in nation designated as a [[land-grant]] college. The institution was coeducational from the first preparatory class admitted in 1868. The formal admitting of students began the following year, and the first graduating class of 1872 consisted of 24 men and 2 women.&lt;ref name=&quot;lib.iastate.edu&quot;/&gt;

The first building on the Iowa State campus was [[Farm House (Knapp-Wilson House)|Farm House]].  Built in the 1860s, it currently serves as a museum and [[National Historic Landmark]]. Today, Iowa State has over 60 notable buildings, including [[Beardshear Hall]], [[Buildings of Iowa State University#Morrill Hall|Morrill Hall]], [[Memorial Union (Iowa State University)|Memorial Union]], Petrashek Auditorium, [[Catt Hall]], Curtiss Hall, [[Carver Hall]], Parks Library, the [[Campanile]], [[Hilton Coliseum]], C.Y. Stephens Auditorium, [[Buildings of Iowa State University#Fisher Theater|Fisher Theater]], [[Jack Trice Stadium]], Lied Recreation Center, numerous residence halls, and many buildings specific to ISU's many different majors and colleges. Iowa State is home to 27,945 students (Fall 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.public.iastate.edu/~registrar/stats/stats-s09.html | title = Stats Spring 2009|publisher = ISU Registrar's Office  | accessdate = December 2, 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and makes up approximately one half of the city's population.

The official mascot for ISU is [[Cy the Cardinal]]. The official school colors are [[cardinal (color)|cardinal]] and [[gold (color)|gold]].  The [[Iowa State Cyclones]] play in the [[NCAA]]'s Division I-A as a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]].

The town is served by [[U.S. Route 30|U.S. Highways 30]] and [[U.S. Route 69|69]] and [[Interstate 35]].  Ames is the only town in Iowa with a population of greater than 50,000 that does not have a state highway serving it.

Ames was serviced by the Fort Dodge, Des Moines and Southern Railroad via a branch from [[Kelley, Iowa|Kelley]] to Iowa State University and to downtown Ames.  The tracks were removed in the 1960s.  The [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company]] twin mainline runs east and west bisecting the town and running just south of the downtown business district.  The [[C&amp;NW]] used to operate a branch to [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]].  This line was removed in the 1980s when the Spine Line through [[Nevada, Iowa|Nevada]] was purchased from the [[Rock Island Railroad]] after its bankruptcy.  The [[Union Pacific]], successor to the C&amp;NW, still runs 60–70 trains a day through Ames on twin mainlines, which leads to some traffic delays. There is also a branch to [[Eagle Grove, Iowa|Eagle Grove]] that leaves Ames to the north. The Union Pacific maintains a small yard called Ames Yard east of Ames between Ames and Nevada.  Ames has been testing automatic train horns at several of its crossings.  These directional horns which are focused down the streets are activated when the crossing signals turn on and are shut off after the train crosses the crossing.  This system cancels out the need for the trains to blow their horns.  Train noise had been a problem in the residential areas to the west and northwest of downtown.

Ames has a municipal airport located {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} southeast of the city.  The current (and only) [[Fixed-Base Operation|FBO]] is Hap's Air Service, a company which has been based at the airport since 1975.  The airport has four runways – 01/19, which is 5700x100 feet, and 13/31, which is 3492x100 feet.

The City of Ames offers a transit system throughout town, called [[CyRide]], that is funded jointly by Iowa State University, the ISU Government of the Student Body, and the City of Ames.  Rider fares are subsidized through this funding, and are free to students and youth.

Ames has the headquarters of the [[Iowa Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iowadot.gov/where.htm Where We Are Located].&quot; [[Iowa Department of Transportation]]. Retrieved on October 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
Iowa is a &quot;[[battleground state]]&quot; that has trended slightly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] in recent years, and Ames, like [[Iowa City]], also trends [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]].  Because Iowa is the first caucus state and Ames is a [[college town]], it is the site of many political appearances, debates and events, especially during election years.

During every August in which the Republican presidential nomination is undecided (meaning there is no incumbent Republican president—as in, most recently, 2007, 1999, 1995 and 1987), the town plays host to the [[Ames Straw Poll]], which gauges support for the various Republican candidates amongst attendees of a [[fundraising]] dinner benefiting the [[Republican Party of Iowa|Iowa Republican Party]].  The straw poll dates back to 1979, and is frequently seen as a first test of organizational strength in Iowa by the national media and party insiders; as such, it can be very beneficial for a candidate to win the straw poll and thus enhance his aura of inevitability or show off a superior field operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/08/14/iowa.saturday.02/|title=Iowa Saturday|publisher=cnn.com|date=August 14, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abalone''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|En-us-abalone.ogg|'æ bʌ loʊ niː}}) (from Spanish ''{{lang|es|abulón}}'') are small to very large-sized edible [[sea snail]]s, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[gastropod]] [[mollusc]]s in the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Haliotidae''' and the genus '''''Haliotis'''''. [[Common names]] for abalones also include '''ear-shells''', sea ears, as well as muttonfish or muttonshells in Australia, '''ormer''' in [[Great Britain]], ''{{lang|af|perlemoen}}'' and '''venus's-ears''' in South Africa and ''{{lang|mi|pāua}}'' in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;MtSS&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Beesley|first=P. L.|title=Mollusca: The Southern Synthesis. Fauna of Australia|year=1998|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|isbn=0 643 05756 0|pages=667–669|coauthors=Ross, G. J. B. &amp; Wells, A.|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family Haliotidae contains only one genus, ''Haliotis''. That genus contains about four to seven subgenera. The number of species recognized worldwide is about 100.

The shells of abalones have a low and open spiral structure, and are characterized by several open respiratory pores in a row near the shell's outer edge. The thick inner layer of the shell is composed of [[nacre]] or mother-of-pearl, which in many species is highly [[Iridescence|iridescent]], giving rise to a range of strong and changeable colors, which make the shells attractive to humans as decorative objects, and as a source of colorful [[mother-of-pearl]].

The flesh of abalones is widely considered to be a desirable food, and is consumed raw or cooked in a wide variety of dishes.

==Description==
[[Image:AbaloneInside.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Iridescence|iridescent]] inside surface of a [[red abalone]] shell. The coin is  about 24 mm in diameter.]]

The shell of abalones has a convex, rounded to oval shape, and may be highly arched or very flattened. It is generally ear shaped, presenting two to three whorls. The last whorl (known as the [[body whorl]]) is [[wiktionary:auriform|auriform]] such that the shell resembles an &quot;ear&quot;, giving rise to the common name ‘ear-shell’. It also has a series of holes near the anterior margin, that are in fact respiratory pores that are used for the escape of water from the gills.  There are four to ten of them, depending on the species. Abalones have no [[Operculum (gastropod)|operculum]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The color of the shell is very variable from species to species, and may reflect the animal's diet.&lt;ref name=MtSS /&gt; The iridescent [[nacre]] that lines the inside of the shell varies in color from silvery white, to pink, red and green-red, through to ''[[Paua|Haliotis iris]]'', which shows predominantly deep blues, greens and purples.

These snails cling solidly with their broad muscular foot to rocky surfaces at [[Sublittoral zone|sublittoral]] depths, although some species such as ''[[Haliotis cracherodii]]'' used to be common in the [[intertidal zone]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Abalones reach maturity at a relatively small size. Their [[fecundity]] is high and increases with their size (from 10,000 to 11 million eggs at a time).{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The [[larva]]e are lecithotrophic (i.e. feed off a yolk sac). The adults are [[herbivore|herbivorous]] and feed with their rhipidoglossan [[radula]] on macroalgae, preferring red or brown algae.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Sizes vary from 20&amp;nbsp;mm (''Haliotis pulcherrima'') to 200&amp;nbsp;mm (or even more) (''Haliotis rufescens'').{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Approximately 1/3 of the weight of the animal is meat, 1/3 is offal, and 1/3 is shell.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

==Distribution==
The haliotid family has a worldwide distribution, along the coastal waters of every continent, except the Atlantic coast of South America, the Caribbean, and the [[East Coast of the United States]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The majority of abalone species are found in cold waters, off the Southern Hemisphere coasts of New Zealand, South Africa and Australia, and Western North America and Japan in the Northern Hemisphere.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The species of sea snail which is known in the sea food trade as the &quot;Chilean abalone&quot;, ''[[Concholepas concholepas]]'', is from another family altogether. It is not a true abalone at all, but a [[Muricidae|muricid]], or rock snail.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Structure and properties of abalone shell==
The shell of the abalone is exceptionally strong and is made of microscopic [[calcium carbonate]] tiles stacked like bricks. Between the layers of shells is a clingy protein substance. When the abalone shell is struck, the tiles slide instead of shattering and the protein stretches to absorb the energy of the blow. Material scientists around the world are studying the tiled structure for insight into stronger ceramic products such as [[body armor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.msea.2004.06.072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dust created through the grinding and cutting of abalone shell is dangerous; appropriate safeguards must be taken to protect people from inhaling these particles. An N95-rated dust [[respirator]], a ventilation system, and wet grinding are requirements to working abalone shell safely. The calcium carbonate dust is a respiratory irritant and the particles can penetrate into the lower respiratory tree and cause irritant [[bronchitis]] and other respiratory irritation responses. The usual symptoms are cough and sputum production, and secondary infections can occur. If there are proteins left in the shell matrix, it is also possible that they can trigger an allergic ([[asthma]]tic) attack.  Allergic skin reactions can also occur.

==Diseases and pests==
Abalones are subject to various diseases. The [[New South Wales]] Department of Primary Industries said in 2007 that abalone viral ganglioneuritis, or AVG, killed up to 90% of stock in affected regions. Abalone are also severe [[hemophiliacs]] as their fluids will not clot in the case of a laceration or puncture wound. Using abalone as bait or burley is illegal in NSW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/aboutus/news/recent-news/fishing-and-aquaculture/abalone-gut-bait-ban ]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Polydorid [[Polychaeta|polychaetes]] are known as pests of abalone.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, C.A. 2011. ''Polydora'' and ''Dipolydora'' (Polychaeta: Spionidae) associated with molluscs on the south coast of South Africa, with descriptions of two new species. ''[[African Invertebrates]]'' '''52''' (1): 39-50.[http://www.africaninvertebrates.org.za/Simon_2011_52_1_507.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport harvesting==
===Australia===
Tasmania provides approximately 25% of the yearly world abalone harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dpiw.tas.gov.au/inter.nsf/WebPages/SCAN-75F423?open| title=Abalone Viral Ganglioneuritis| accessdate=2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 12,500 Tasmanians recreationally fish for [[Haliotis rubra|blacklip]] and [[Haliotis laevigata|greenlip]] abalone. For blacklip abalone, the size limit varies from between 138&amp;nbsp;mm for the southern end of the state and 127&amp;nbsp;mm for the northern end of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dpiw.tas.gov.au/inter.nsf/WebPages/ALIR-4YNVZ7?open#GreenlipAbaloneSizeL| title=Abalone Fishing| accessdate=2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenlip abalone have a minimum size of 145&amp;nbsp;mm, except for an area around Perkin's Bay in the north of the state where the minimum size is 132&amp;nbsp;mm. With a recreational abalone licence, there is a bag limit of 10 per day, and a total possession limit of 20. [[Scuba diving]] for abalone is allowed and has a rich history in Australia.  (Scuba diving for abalone in the state of New South Wales is illegal, where a free diving catch limit of two is permitted).&lt;ref name=western&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wong, RM |title=Abalone diving in Western Australia diving practices in 1999. |year=2001 |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=31 |issue=3 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7731 |accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=southern&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pollard, G |title=Abalone fishing in south Australia. |year=2001 |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=31 |issue=3 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7735 |accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===
[[Image:White abalone Haliotis sorenseni.jpg|thumb|right|Two highly endangered White Abalone. Prohibitions on commercial and recreational harvest of this species have been in place since 1996.]]
Sport harvesting of [[red abalone]] is permitted with a California fishing license and an abalone stamp card. New in 2008, the abalone card also comes with a set of 24 tags. Legal-size abalone must be tagged immediately. Abalone may only be taken using breath-hold techniques or shorepicking; [[scuba diving]] for abalone is strictly prohibited. Taking of abalone is not permitted south of the mouth of the [[San Francisco Bay]]. There is a size minimum of seven inches (178&amp;nbsp;mm)  measured across the shell and a quantity limit of three per day and 24 per year. A person may be in possession of only three abalone at any given time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Abalone may only be taken from April to November, not including July. Transportation of abalone may only legally occur while the abalone is still attached in the shell. Sale of sport-obtained abalone is illegal, including the shell. Only red abalone may be taken; [[Black abalone|black]], [[White abalone|white]], pink, and flat abalone are protected by law.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

An abalone diver is normally equipped with a thick [[wetsuit]], including a hood, booties, and gloves, and usually also a mask, [[snorkel]], [[weight belt]], abalone iron, and abalone gauge. Alternatively, the rock picker can feel underneath rocks at low tides for abalone. Abalone are mostly taken in depths from a few inches up to 10&amp;nbsp;m (33&amp;nbsp;ft); less common are freedivers who can work deeper than 10&amp;nbsp;m (33&amp;nbsp;ft). Abalone are normally found on rocks near food sources (kelp). An abalone iron is used to pry the abalone from the rock before it can fully clamp down. Divers commonly dive out of boats, [[kayak]]s, tube floats or directly off the shore.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

There has been a trade in diving to catch abalones off parts of the United States coast from before 1939. In World War II, many of these abalone divers were recruited into the United States armed forces and trained as [[frogman|frogmen]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The largest abalone recorded in California is {{convert|12.83&lt;!-- 12 5/6 --&gt;|in|mm}}, caught by John Pepper somewhere off the coast of Humboldt county.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smookler2005p76&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Smookler|title=San Mateo County Coast|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KWtomVo9nekC|year=2005|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9780738530611|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=KWtomVo9nekC&amp;pg=PA76 76]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{Main|Paua|Haliotis iris}}
There is an extensive global black market in the collection and export of abalone meat. In New Zealand, where abalone is called '''pāua''' (from the [[Māori language]]), this can be a particularly awkward problem where the right to harvest pāua can be granted legally under [[Māori people|Māori]] customary rights. When such permits to harvest are abused, it is frequently difficult to police. The legal recreational daily limit is 10 pāua per diver with a minimum shell length of 125&amp;nbsp;mm. The limit is strictly enforced by roving Ministry of Fisheries officers with the backing of the New Zealand Police. Pāua 'poaching' is a major industry in New Zealand with many thousands being taken illegally, often undersized. Convictions have resulted in seizure of diving gear, boats, and motor vehicles as well as fines and in rare cases, imprisonment. The Ministry of Fisheries expects in the year 2004/05, nearly 1,000 tons of pāua will be poached, with 75% of that being undersized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fish.govt.nz/information/corp-docs/soi-04-08/pau2-industry-association.pdf ]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highly polished New Zealand pāua shells are extremely popular as souvenirs with their striking blue, green, and purple iridescence.

===South Africa===
The largest abalone in South Africa, the perlemoen, ''Haliotis midae'', occurs along approximately two-thirds of the country’s coastline. Perlemoen-diving has been a recreational activity for many years, but stocks are currently being threatened by illegal commercial harvesting. In South Africa all persons harvesting this animal need permits that are issued on a yearly basis, and no abalone may be harvested using [[Scuba set|scuba gear]].

For the last few years, however, no permits have been issued for collecting abalone (perlemoen), but commercial harvesting still continues as does illegal collection by [[Criminal organization|syndicates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2007-04-11-six-arrested-in-massive-perlemoen-bust |title=Six arrested in massive perlemoen bust |accessdate=11 November 2008|publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian |date=11 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, because of widespread [[poaching]] of abalone, the South African government listed perlemoen as an endangered species according to the [[CITES]] section III appendix, which requests member governments to monitor the trade in this species.  This listing was removed from CITES in June 2010 by the South African government and South African abalone is no longer subject to CITES trade controls.  Export permits are still required, however.
The abalone meat from South Africa is prohibited for sale in the country to help reduce poaching; however, much of the illegally harvested meat is sold in Asian countries. As of early 2008, the wholesale price for abalone meat was approximately US$40.00 per kilogram.  There is an active trade in the shells, which sell for more than US$1,400 per metric tonne.  There is, however, speculation that local criminal gangs barter abalone illegally with Chinese nationals in exchange for chemicals used in the production of drugs, reducing the need for the use of money and hence avoiding money laundering difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capeargus.co.za/?fSectionId=3571&amp;fArticleId=vn20090411065235212C189274 |title=Cape Argus |publisher=Cape Argus |date=2009-04-11 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Channel Islands===
Ormers (''[[Green ormer|Haliotis tuberculata]]'') are considered a delicacy in the British [[Channel Islands]] and are pursued with great alacrity by the locals. This has led to a dramatic depletion in numbers since the latter half of the 19th century, and 'ormering' is now strictly regulated in order to preserve stocks. The gathering of ormers is now restricted to a number of 'ormering tides', from January 1 to April 30, which occur on the full or new moon and two days following. No ormers may be taken from the beach that are under 80&amp;nbsp;mm in shell length. Gatherers are not allowed to wear wetsuits or even put their heads underwater. Any breach of these laws is a criminal offence and can lead to fine of up to £5,000 or six months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodfoodguernsey.gg/fromthesea/ormer.aspx http://www.goodfoodguernsey.gg/fromthesea/ormer.aspx] ''goodfoodguernsey.gg''&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for ormers is such that they led to the world's first underwater arrest, when Mr. Kempthorne-Leigh of Guernsey was arrested by a police officer in full diving gear when illegally diving for ormers.


==Human use==
The meat (foot muscle) of abalone is used for food, and the shells of abalone are used as decorative items and as a source of [[mother of pearl]].

===Farming===
[[Image:Abalone-farm1web.jpg|thumb|right|An abalone farm]]
{{See also|Aquaculture|Mariculture}}
Farming of abalone began in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Japan and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishtech.com/abaloneinfo.html| title=Abalone Farming Information|accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1990s, there have been many increasingly successful endeavors to commercially farm abalone for the purpose of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,49847,00.html| title=Abalone Farming on a Boat|accessdate=2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-fishing and poaching have reduced wild populations to such an extent that farmed abalone now supplies most of the abalone meat consumed.  The principal abalone farming regions are China, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea. Abalone is also farmed in Australia, Hawaii, Canada, Chile, France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/reise/europa/0,1518,688155,00.html| title=Abalone Zucht in der Bretagne|accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland, Ireland, Mexico, Namibia, New Zealand, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/docs/aqwa/Abalone/index.php| title=Abalone Farming Around the World|accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Consumption===
{{See also|Bao yu}}
Abalone have long been a valuable food source for humans in every area of the world where a species is abundant.

The meat of this mollusk is considered a [[delicacy]] in certain parts of [[Latin America]] (especially [[Chile]]), France, New Zealand, [[Southeast Asia]], and [[East Asia]] (especially in China, Japan, and Korea). In Chinese speaking regions, abalone are commonly known as [[bao yu]], and sometimes forms part of a Chinese banquet. Similar to [[shark fin soup]] or [[birds nest soup]], it is considered a [[luxury item]], and is traditionally reserved for special occasions such as weddings and other celebrations. However, the availability of commercially farmed abalone has allowed more common consumption of this once rare delicacy.

In Japan, live and raw abalone are used in awabi sushi, or served steamed, salted, boiled, chopped, or simmered in soy sauce. Salted, fermented abalone entrails are the main component of tottsuru, a local dish from Honshū.

In California, abalone receive more relaxed treatment and can be found on pizza, sautéed with caramelized mango or in steak form dusted with cracker meal and flour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefoodpaper.com/features/abalonefarm.html |title=Maritime Morsels |accessdate=2008-10-14 |last=Gayot |first=Alain |date=2008-09-22 |work= article|publisher=The Food Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mollusc ''[[Concholepas concholepas]]'' is often sold in the United States under the name &quot;Chilean abalone&quot;, though it is not an abalone, but a [[Muricidae|muricid]].

=== Decorative items ===
[[Image:Abalonejewellery.jpg|thumb|left|Abalone jewelry]]
The highly iridescent inner nacre layer of the shell of abalone has traditionally been used as a decorative item, in [[jewelry]],&lt;ref name=MtSS /&gt; buttons, and as inlay in furniture and in musical instruments such as guitars, etc.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Abalone pearl jewelry is very popular in New Zealand and Australia, in no minor part due to the marketing and farming efforts of pearl companies. Unlike the Oriental Natural, the Akoya pearl, and the South Sea and Tahitian cultured pearls, abalone pearls are not primarily judged by their roundness.  Also, unlike other types of pearls, abalone pearls are not subjected to any type of processing, such as bleaching or buffing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
