==Orders==
===Cardinal bishop===
[[Image:Sodano.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Angelo Sodano|Cardinal Sodano]], current Dean of the College]]
Cardinal bishops, or cardinals of the Episcopal Order, are among the most senior [[prelates]] of the Catholic Church. Since most cardinals are also bishops, the title of cardinal bishop only means that the cardinal in question holds the title of one of the &quot;[[suburbicarian diocese|suburbicarian]]&quot; sees — they include the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] — or is a patriarch of an Eastern Catholic church.

The cardinal bishops are the only order of cardinals who have ''always'' been required to be bishops, and in former times when a cardinal of one of the lower orders became a cardinal bishop, and so the head of a diocese, he was consecrated a bishop. Since 1962 all cardinals have been required to receive episcopal consecration unless they were granted an exemption from this obligation by the [[Pope]]; however, since each of the suburbicarian sees is now headed by its own bishop and not the cardinal bishop himself, theoretically, a cardinal could now occupy any rank within the Sacred College without receiving episcopal consecration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The Dean, the head (as ''[[primus inter pares]]'') of the College of Cardinals, is elected by the cardinal bishops holding suburbicarian sees from among their own number, an election, however, that must be approved by the pope. Formerly the position of Dean belonged to the longest-serving of the cardinal bishops, all six of whom then headed a suburbicarian see. Though these sees are now seven (Ostia and Velletri having been separated in 1914), there are only six cardinal bishops, since the Dean always adds the title of Ostia to his original suburbicarian diocese.

In early times the privilege of [[papal election]] was not reserved to the cardinals, and for centuries the pope was customarily a Roman priest and never a bishop from elsewhere; to preserve [[apostolic succession]] the rite of consecrating the pope as a [[bishop]] had to be performed by someone who was already a bishop. The rule remains that, if the person elected pope is not yet a bishop, he is consecrated by the Dean of the College of Cardinals, the Cardinal [[bishop of Ostia]].

Currently the cardinal bishops of the suburbicarian diocese are:
* [[Angelo Sodano]], Cardinal [[Bishop of Ostia]] and [[Bishop of Albano|Albano]], [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], former [[Cardinal Secretary of State]]
* [[Roger Etchegaray]], [[Cardinal Bishop of Porto-Santa Rufina]], Vice-Dean, President emeritus of the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace]]
* [[Giovanni Battista Re]], [[bishop of Sabina|Cardinal Bishop of Sabina-Poggio Mirteto]], Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for Bishops
* [[Francis Arinze]], [[Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni]], Prefect Emeritus of the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]].
* [[Tarcisio Bertone]], [[Cardinal Bishop of Frascati]], [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] and [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]]
* [[José Saraiva Martins]], [[Cardinal Bishop of Palestrina]], Prefect Emeritus of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]]

For a period ending in the mid-20th century, long-serving cardinal priests were entitled to fill vacancies that arose among the cardinal bishops, just as [[cardinal deacon]]s of ten years' standing are still entitled to become cardinal priests. Since then, cardinals have been advanced to cardinal bishop exclusively by Papal appointment.

In 1965 [[Pope Paul VI]] decreed in his [[motu proprio]] ''Ad Purpuratorum Patrum'' that [[patriarch]]s of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] who were named cardinals would also be part of the episcopal order, ranked after the six cardinal bishops of the suburbicarian sees (who had been relieved of direct responsibilities for those sees by [[Pope John XXIII]] three years earlier). Not holding a suburbicarian see, they cannot elect the dean nor become dean. The four [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern]] patriarchs who are now cardinal bishops are the following:
* [[Ignatius I Daoud|Ignace Daoud]], Prefect emeritus of the [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]], [[List of Syriac Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch|Patriarch Emeritus of Antioch]] for the [[Syrian Catholic Church|Syrians]]
* [[Nasrallah Sfeir]], [[List of Maronite Patriarchs|Patriarch Emeritus of Antioch]] for the [[Maronite]]s
* [[Emmanuel III Delly]], [[List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon|Patriarch of Babylon for the Chaldeans]]
* [[Antonios Naguib]], [[List of Coptic Catholic Patriarchs of Alexandria| Patriarch of Alexandria for the Copts]]

The [[Latin Rite]] [[Patriarch of Lisbon|Patriarchs of Lisbon]] and [[Patriarch of Venice|Venice]], while in practice always made cardinals at the [[consistory]] after they take possession of their sees, are made cardinal priests, not cardinal bishops. Although the incumbents of such prestigious sees are usually created cardinal, no see carries an actual right to the cardinalate.

===Cardinal priest===
[[Image:Eugenio Sales.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Eugênio Sales|Cardinal Sales]], current Cardinal [[Protopriest]].]]
Cardinal priests are the most numerous of the three orders of cardinals in the Catholic Church, ranking above the cardinal deacons and below the cardinal bishops. Those who are named cardinal priests today are generally [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]]s of important [[diocese]]s throughout the world, though some hold [[Roman Curia|Curial]] positions.

In modern times the name &quot;cardinal priest&quot; is interpreted as meaning a cardinal who is of the order of priests. Originally, however, this referred to certain key priests of important churches of the Diocese of Rome, who were recognized as the ''cardinal'' priests, the important priests chosen by the pope to advise him in his duties as [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]] (the Latin ''cardo'' means &quot;hinge&quot;). Certain clerics in many dioceses at the time, not just that of Rome, were said to be the key personnel — the term gradually became exclusive to Rome to indicate those entrusted with electing the bishop of Rome, the pope.

While the cardinalate has long been expanded beyond the Roman pastoral clergy and [[Roman Curia]], every cardinal priest has titular church in Rome, though they may be bishops or archbishops elsewhere, just as cardinal bishops are given one of the suburban dioceses around Rome. [[Pope Paul VI]] abolished all administrative rights cardinals had with regard to their titular churches, though the cardinal's name and coat of arms are still posted in the church, and they are expected to preach there if convenient when they are in Rome.

While the number of cardinals was small from the times of the [[Roman Empire]] to the [[Renaissance]], and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest, in the 16th century the College expanded markedly. In 1587 [[Pope Sixtus V]] sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the College at 70, including 50 cardinal priests, about twice the historical number. This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally due to a building falling into disrepair. When [[Pope John XXIII]] abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] and [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] continued to do. Today there are close to 150 titular churches, out of over 300 churches in Rome.

The cardinal who is the longest-serving member of the order of cardinal priests is titled ''cardinal [[protopriest]]''. He had certain ceremonial duties in the conclave that have effectively ceased because he would generally be over the age of 80, past which cardinals are barred from the conclave. The current cardinal protopriest is [[Eugênio de Araújo Sales]] of [[Brazil]].

===Cardinal deacon===
[[Image:Wolsey.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]]]]

The cardinal deacons are the lowest-ranking cardinals. Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are either officials of the [[Roman Curia]] or priests elevated after their eightieth birthday. Bishops with pastoral responsibilities on the other hand are created cardinal priests.

Cardinal deacons derive originally from the seven deacons in the [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household|Papal Household]] and the seven deacons who supervised the Church's works in the districts of [[Rome]] during the early Middle Ages, when the Church administration was effectively the government of Rome and provided all social services. Cardinal deacons are given title to one of these deaconries. 

Under the 1587 decree of [[Pope Sixtus V]] that fixed the maximum size of the [[College of Cardinals]], there were 14 diaconates. Later the number increased. As of 2005, there were over 50 recognized titular diaconates, though only 30 cardinals were of the order of Deacons. Cardinal deacons have long enjoyed the right to &quot;opt for the order of cardinal priests&quot; (''optazione'') after they have been cardinal deacons for ten years. They may on such elevation take a vacant ''title'' (church allotted as the titular dignity of a cardinal priest) or their existing diaconate may be elevated to title for that occasion. When elevated to cardinal priests, they take their precedence according to the day they were first made cardinal deacons (thus ranking above cardinal priests that were elevated to the college after them, regardless of order).

When not celebrating Mass but still serving a liturgical function, such as the semiannual ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' Papal Blessing, some Papal Masses and some events at Ecumenical Councils, cardinal deacons can be recognized by the [[dalmatic]]s they would don with the simple white mitre (so called ''mitra simplex'').

==== Cardinal Proto-Deacon or Senior Cardinal Deacon====
The [[Cardinal protodeacon]] or Senior Cardinal Deacon (that is, the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals) has the privilege of [[Habemus Papam|announcing a new pope's election ]] and name (once he has been ordained to the Episcopate&lt;ref&gt;Ap. Const. [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html Universi Dominici Gregis, No. 89]&lt;/ref&gt;) from the central balcony at the [[Basilica of Saint Peter]] in [[Vatican City State]]. In the past, during papal coronations, the Proto-Deacon also had the honor of bestowing the pallium on the new pope and crowning him with the [[papal tiara]].  The Proto-Deacon's privilege of crowning a new pope ended when Pope John Paul I chose not to be crowned and opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony, and his two immediate successors also decided not to be crowned.  However, the Proto-Deacon still has the privilege of bestowing the pallium on a new pope at his papal inauguration.  “Acting in the place of the [[Roman Pontiff]], he also confers the [[pallium]] upon [[Metropolitan bishop#Roman Catholic|metropolitan bishops]] or gives the [[pallium]] to their proxies.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P19.HTM Canon 355 §2]&lt;/ref&gt; The current Cardinal Proto-Deacon is [[Jean-Louis Tauran]].

==Special types of cardinals==

===Camerlengo===
The Cardinal [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]], assisted by the Vice-Camerlengo and the other prelates of the office known as the Apostolic Camera, has functions that in essence are limited to a period of [[sede vacante]] of the papacy. He is to collate information about the financial situation of all administrations dependent on the Holy See and present the results to the College of Cardinals, as they gather for the [[papal conclave]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19880628_pastor-bonus-roman-curia_en.html#ADMINISTRATIVE%20SERVICES ''Pastor bonus'': Administrative Services]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardinals who are not bishops===
Until 1917 it was possible for someone who was not a priest, but only in [[minor orders]], to become a cardinal (see &quot;lay cardinals&quot;, below), but they were enrolled only in the order of cardinal deacons. For example, in the 16th century, [[Reginald Pole]] was a cardinal for 18 years before he was ordained a priest. In 1917 it was established that all cardinals, even cardinal deacons, had to be priests,&lt;ref&gt;Canon 232 §1 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1962, [[John XXIII]] set the norm that all cardinals be bishops. Consequently, canon 351 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law requires that a cardinal be at least in the order of [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] at his appointment, and that those who are not already [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] must receive episcopal consecration, a rule from which [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] may be obtained from the pope, as by Cardinals [[Avery Dulles]], [[Roberto Tucci]], [[Albert Vanhoye]], and most recently [[Domenico Bartolucci]]. A cardinal who is not a bishop is still entitled to wear and use the episcopal vestments and other [[pontificalia]] (episcopal regalia: [[mitre]], [[crozier]], [[zucchetto]], [[pectoral cross]] and ring).

===&quot;Lay cardinals&quot;===
{{Main|Lay cardinal}}
At various times there have been cardinals who had only received [[tonsure#Western Christianity|first tonsure]] and [[minor orders]] but not yet been [[Holy Orders|ordained]] as [[deacon]]s or priests. Though [[clergy|clerics]], they were inaccurately called &quot;[[lay cardinal]]s&quot; and were permitted to marry. [[Teodolfo Mertel]] was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the [[Code of Canon Law]] promulgated in 1917 by [[Pope Benedict XV]], only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_PO.HTM canon 232 §1] of the 1917 Code of Canon Law&lt;/ref&gt; Since the time of [[Pope John XXIII]] a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P18.HTM canon 351 §1] of the 1983 Code of Canon Law&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardinals ''in pectore'' or secret cardinals==
{{Main|In pectore}}
In addition to the named cardinals, the pope may name secret cardinals or cardinals ''[[in pectore]]'' (Latin for ''in the breast'').

During the [[Western Schism]] many cardinals were created by the contending popes. Beginning with the reign of [[Pope Martin V]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CE-cardinal&quot; /&gt; cardinals were created without publishing their names until later, termed ''creati et reservati in pectore''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/consistories-xv.htm#MartinV | title=Consistories of Martin V - July 23, 1423 (II), Note | work=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cardinal named ''in pectore'' is known only to the pope; not even the cardinal so named is necessarily aware of his elevation, and in any event cannot function as a cardinal while his appointment is ''in pectore''. Today, cardinals are named ''in pectore'' to protect them or their congregations from reprisals if their identities were known.

If conditions change, so that the pope judges it safe to make the appointment public, he may do so at any time. The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those raised to the cardinalate at the time of his ''in pectore'' appointment. If a pope dies before revealing the identity of an ''in pectore'' cardinal, the cardinalate expires. Some speculate that the pope could leave instructions in writing, perhaps in his will, for the appointment to be made known after his death; but it is difficult to imagine a case in which the pope would consider that his own death would remove the obstacle in the way of publishing the name.

Of the 232 cardinals that [[Pope John Paul II]] elevated, four were named ''in pectore''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/santopadre_biografie/giovanni_paolo_ii_biografia_breve_en.html | title=His Holiness John Paul II Short Biography | work=[[Holy See]] Press Office | date=30 June 2005 | accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/santopadre_biografie/giovanni_paolo_ii_biografia_pontificato_en.html#2003 | title=His Holiness John Paul II Biography | work=[[Holy See]] Press Office | date=30 June 2005 | accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identities of three of these were subsequently revealed:
* [[Ignatius Kung Pin-Mei]], [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China]] - made cardinal 1979, revealed 1991, died 2000.
* [[Marian Jaworski]], [[Archbishop]] of [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]] - made cardinal 1998, revealed 2001.
* [[Jānis Pujāts]], Archbishop of [[Riga]], [[Latvia]] - made cardinal 1998, revealed 2001.
* The fourth cardinal was created in 2003. John Paul II did not reveal this cardinal's identity prior to his death, or in the 15-page testament he wrote during his papacy and which was released after his death. Consequently, this cardinalate expired. Some suspect that this &quot;secret Cardinal&quot; was Archbishop [[Stanisław Dziwisz]], a close, longtime friend of John Paul II. However, he was made a cardinal at the 24 March 2006 consistory anyway, as was announced by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on 22 February 2006.

==Vesture and privileges==
{{Main|Pontifical vestments}}

He told them that the red signifies the dignity of their new office and that they must be ready &quot;even to the point of spilling your blood for the increase of the Christian faith, for peace and harmony among the people of God, for freedom and the spread of the Holy Roman Catholic Church.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/article3196655.ece Applause and tears in Basilica greet Pontiff] (November 26, 2007) ''Belfast Telegraph''. Accessed 2008-06-01. Quote: &quot;In a ceremony televised across the world cardinal-elect Sean Brady knelt before Pope Benedict XVI and pledged his allegiance to the Church before receiving his special red birretta — a symbol of a cardinal's dignity and willingness to shed blood for the increase of the Christian faith.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Excluding the [[rochet]] — which is always white — the scarlet garments include the [[cassock]], [[mozzetta]], and [[biretta]] (over the usual scarlet [[zucchetto]]). The biretta of a cardinal is distinctive not merely for its scarlet color, but also for the fact that it does not have a pompon or tassel on the top as do the birettas of other prelates.  Until the 1460s, it was customary for cardinals to wear a [[violet (color)|violet]] or [[blue]] cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business. His normal-wear [[simar]] is black but has scarlet [[piping (sewing)|piping]] and a scarlet [[fascia (vestment)|fascia]] (sash-like belt). Occasionally, a cardinal wears a scarlet ''[[ferraiolo]]'' which is a cape worn over the shoulders, tied at the neck in a bow by narrow strips of cloth in the front, without any 'trim' or piping on it. (It is because of the scarlet color of cardinals' vesture that the [[cardinal (bird)|bird of the same name]] has become known as such.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Instruction on the dress, titles and coat-of-arms of cardinals, bishops and lesser prelates. | publisher=[[L'Osservatore Romano]], English ed. | date=17 April 1969 | pages=vol.4 | url=http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm | accessdate=2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern-rite]] cardinals continue to wear the normal dress appropriate to their rite, though some may line their cassocks with scarlet and wear scarlet fascias, or in some cases, wear Eastern-style cassocks entirely of scarlet. (There is a [http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6322/78/1600/SlypyjGalero1.jpg painting] of [[Josyf Slipyj]], [[Major Archbishop]] of the [[Ukrainian Catholic Church]] and Cardinal, wearing the traditional eastern bishop's habit and the now abolished cardinal's galero.)

In previous times, at the [[consistory]] at which the pope named a new cardinal, he would bestow upon him a distinctive wide-brimmed hat called a [[galero]]. This custom has been discontinued, and the investiture now takes place with the scarlet biretta. In [[ecclesiastical heraldry]], however, the scarlet galero is still displayed on the cardinal's [[coat of arms]]. Cardinals had the right to display the galero in their cathedral, and when a cardinal died, it would be suspended from the ceiling above his tomb. Some cardinals will still have a galero made, even though it is not officially part of their apparel.

To symbolize their bond with the [[papacy]], the pope gives each newly appointed cardinal a gold ring,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paulson, [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/paulson/blog/2006/03/25/index.html Bling!] (examination of the ring of Cardinal O'Malley, with photos). Boston.com ([[Boston Globe]]). March 25, 2006. Retrieved 2010-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt; which is traditionally [[hand-kiss|kissed]] by Catholics when greeting a cardinal (as with a [[bishop]]'s episcopal ring). The pope chooses the image on the outside: under [[Pope Benedict XVI]] it is a modern depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus, with [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] and [[John the Evangelist|John]] to each side. The ring includes the pope's coat of arms on the inside.

Cardinals have in [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] a &quot;privilege of forum&quot; (i.e., exemption from being judged by ecclesiastical tribunals of ordinary rank): only the pope is competent to judge them in matters subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction (cases that refer to matters that are spiritual or linked with the spiritual, or with regard to infringement of ecclesiastical laws and whatever contains an element of sin, where culpability must be determined and the appropriate ecclesiastical penalty imposed). This does not exempt them from being judged for alleged violations of civil law. The pope either decides the case himself or delegates the decision to another tribunal, usually one of the tribunals or congregations of the Roman Curia.

==Cardinals in popular culture==
* Among others, [[Vincent Price]], [[Charlton Heston]], and [[Tim Curry]] have played [[Cardinal Richelieu]] in adaptations of ''[[The Three Musketeers]]''.
* [[Orson Welles]] played [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] in the 1966 screen adaptation of ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'', while [[Anthony Quayle]] played him in the 1969 film of ''[[Anne of the Thousand Days]]'', and [[Sam Neill]] played him in the first season of the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[The Tudors]]'' (2007), until the character's death.
* [[Anthony Quinn]] played the fictional Cardinal Lakota, who becomes Pope in ''[[The Shoes of the Fisherman]]'' (1968). Several other fictional Cardinals were portrayed in that film.
* In one popular episode of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (1970), skits were interrupted by [[Cardinal Ximenes]] (played by [[Michael Palin]]), &quot;Cardinal Biggles&quot; ([[Terry Jones]]) and &quot;Cardinal Fang&quot; ([[Terry Gilliam]]) of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]: &quot;Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!&quot;
* [[George Carlin]] played the fictional Cardinal Glick in ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' (1999).
* [[Jonathan Pryce]] played the fictional Cardinal Houseman in ''[[Stigmata (film)|Stigmata]]'' (1995) and the real Cardinal de Rohan in ''[[The Affair of the Necklace]]'' (2001).
* [[John Huston]] played the fictional Cardinal Glennon in ''[[The Cardinal]]'' (1963). That character is not to be confused with the real-life [[John J. Glennon|Cardinal Glennon]], who was elevated to that rank by Pope Pius XII in 1946 but then died in Ireland before he could make it back to the United States.
* In the comic book ''[[Warrior Nun Areala]]'', [[Characters in Warrior Nun Areala|Cardinals X, Stark, and Shoc]] serve as military leaders for the fictional Catholic Corps.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:CantigasDeSantaMariaPanPipes.jpg|thumb|200px|An illustration from the E codex of the Cantigas de Santa Maria.]]
The '''''Cantigas de Santa Maria''''' (&quot;Canticles of Holy Mary&quot;) are manuscripts written in [[Galician-Portuguese]], with musical notation, during the reign of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X ''El Sabio'']] (1221–1284) and are one of the largest collections of monophonic (solo) songs from the [[Middle Ages]]. All of the songs at least mention the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], and every 10th is a religious hymn. Some of the manuscripts containing this music also contain colored [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] showing pairs of musicians playing a wide variety of [[musical instrument|instruments]].

==Description==
{{Listen|filename=Santa Maria.ogg|title=&quot;Santa Maria, strela do dia&quot;|description=Cantiga 100, &quot;Santa Maria, strela do dia&quot;|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The Cantigas are written in Galician-Portuguese, the lyrical language of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] at the time. The Cantigas are composed of 420 poems, 356 of which are in a narrative format relating to Marian miracles; the rest of them, except an introduction and two prologues, are of ''lore'' or involve Marian festivities. The Cantigas depict the Virgin Mary in a very humanized way, often having her play a role in earthly episodes.

The authors are unknown, even if several studies indicate that [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] poet Airas Nunes might well have been the author of a large part of them. King Alfonso X &amp;mdash; named as Affonso in the Cantigas &amp;mdash; is also believed to be an author of some of them as he refers himself in first person. Support for this theory can be found in the prologue of the Cantigas. Also, many sources credit Alfonso owing to his influence on other works within the poetic tradition, including his introduction on religious song. Although King Alfonso X's authorship is debatable, his influence is not. While the other major works that came out of Alfonso's workshops, including  histories and other prose texts, were in Castilian, the Cantigas are in Galician-Portuguese, and reflect the popularity in the Castilian court of other poetic corpuses such as the [[cantigas d'amigo]] and cantigas d'amor.

[[Image:MALaute1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[lute]] player.]]
The metrics are extraordinarily diverse: 280 different formats for the 420 Cantigas. The most common are the ''[[virelai]]'' and the ''[[Rondeau (music)|rondeau]]''. The length of the lines varies between two and 24 syllables. The narrative voice in many of the songs describes an erotic relationship, in the troubadour fashion, with the Divine. According to 2000 publishings by scholar Manuel Pedro Ferreira the models for the Cantigas might actually be something different than a traditional French rondeau. He calls the format for some of the Cantigas the &quot;Andalusian rondeau&quot; which has a structure of AB/BB/AB.

The music is written in notation which is similar to that used for chant, but also contains some information about the length of the notes. Several transcriptions exist.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Cantigas are frequently recorded and performed by [[Early Music]] groups, and quite a few CDs featuring music from the Cantigas are available.

===Codices===
The Cantigas are preserved in four manuscripts: To (codice de Toledo, T, F (codice de Florencia) and E (codice de los musicos). E is currently held in [[El Escorial]] and contains the largest number of Cantigas (400+); it contains no less than 41 carefully detailed miniatures and many illuminated letters. To, from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], is the earliest of the manucripts and contains the smallest number of songs (126). Although it is not illustrated, it is richly decorated with pen flourished initials, and great care has been taken over its construction. The T and F[[Florence]] manuscripts are sister volumes. T contains just under 200 cantigas which roughly correspond in order to the first two hundred in E, each song is illustrated with either 6 or 12 miniatures that depict scenes from the cantiga. F follows the same format but has only 109 cantigas. These are the same as those found in the second half of E, however they are presented here in a radically different order. F was never finished, and so no music was ever added. Only the empty staves display the intention to add musical notation to the codice at a later date. It is generally thought that the codices were constructed during Alfonso's lifetime, To perhaps in the 1270s, and T/F and E in the early 1280s up until the time of his death in 1284.

===The music===
{{Original research|section|date=November 2010}}
The musical forms within the Cantigas, and there are many, are still being studied. There have been many false leads, and there is little beyond pitch value that is very reliable. Mensuration is a particular problem in the Cantigas, and most attempts at determining meaningful rhythmic schemes have tended, with some exceptions, to be unsatisfactory. This remains a lively topic of debate and study. Progress, while on-going, has nevertheless been significant over the course of the last 20 years. According to Manuel Pedro Ferreira, a scholar on the Cantigas, the music found in the Cantigas cannot be classified as Arabic, but instead must be classified as &quot;Moorish-Andalusian&quot;. This musical influence is unusual in European music of the Middle Ages, and lends special qualities to the collection, although it does not predominate. The more obvious and demonstrable influences that come directly from the Latin and Byzantine ecclesiastical traditions must be taken into account.

[[Image:Claudio Monteverdi.jpg|thumb|220px|Claudio Monteverdi in 1640 by [[Bernardo Strozzi]]]]

'''Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi''' ({{IPA-it|ˈklaudjo monteˈverdi}}; 15 May 1567 (baptized) &amp;ndash; 29 November 1643) was an Italian [[composer]], [[viol|gambist]], and singer.

Monteverdi's work, often regarded as revolutionary, marked the transition from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] style of music to that of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Halsey, William D., ed.  ''Collier's Encyclopedia''.  Vol. 16.  New York:  MacMillan Educational Company, 1991.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}&lt;!--Author, article title, and (optional for an encyclopedia entry) page number needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He developed two individual styles of composition: the heritage of Renaissance polyphony and the new [[basso continuo]] technique of the Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;Ringer, Mark.  ''Opera's First Master:  The Musical Dramas of Claudio Monteverdi''.  Canada:  Amadeus Press, 2006.{{Page needed|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enjoying fame in his lifetime, he wrote one of the earliest [[opera]]s, ''[[L'Orfeo]]'', which is still regularly performed.

==Life==
[[Image:Primeiro retrato de Monteverdi.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Claudio Monteverdi, circa 1597, by an anonymous artist, ([[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]). Thought to be the earliest known image of Monteverdi, at about age 30, painted when he was still at the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga Court]] in [[Mantua]].]]

Claudio Monteverdi was born in 1567 in [[Cremona]], a town in Northern Italy. His father was Baldassare Monteverdi, a doctor, apothecary and surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;Halsey, William D., ed. ''Collier's Encyclopedia''.  Vol. 16 New York:  MacMillan Educational Company, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the oldest of five children.&lt;ref&gt;Redlich, H. F. ''Claudio Monteverdi:  Life and Work''.  London:  [[Oxford University Press]], 1952, {{Page needed|date=December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  During his childhood, he was taught by [[Marc'Antonio Ingegneri]],&lt;ref&gt;Redlich, H. F.  ''Claudio Monteverdi:  Life and Work''. London:  Oxford University Press, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''maestro di cappella'' at the [[Cathedral of Cremona]].&lt;ref&gt;Schrade, Leo.  ''Monteverdi:  Creator of Modern Music''. New York:  [[W. W.

''The Cambridge Companion to Monteverdi''.  Cambridge:  [[Cambridge University Press]], 2007, {{Page needed|date=December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Monteverdi learned about music by being part of the cathedral choir.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schrade, Leo 1950&quot;&gt;Schrade, Leo.  ''Monteverdi:  Creator of Modern Music''. New York:  W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1950, {{Page needed|date=December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   He also studied at the University of Cremona.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schrade, Leo 1950&quot;/&gt;  His first music was written for publication, including some [[motet]]s and sacred [[madrigal (music)|madrigals]], in 1582 and 1583.&lt;ref&gt;Schrade, Leo.  ''Monteverdi:  Creator of Modern Music''. New York:  W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; His first five compositions were:  ''Cantiunculae Sacrae'', 1582; ''Madrigal Spirituali'', 1583; the three-part canzonets, 1584; and the five-part madrigals– Book I, 1587, and Book II, 1590.&lt;ref&gt;Halsey, William D., ed.  ''Collier's Encyclopedia''. Vol. 16.  New York:  MacMillan Educational Company, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1587, he had produced his first book of secular madrigals. Monteverdi worked for the court of Mantua first as a singer and violist, then as music director.&lt;ref&gt;Kamien Roger, ''An Appreciation of Music 4th brief edition''.  Boston:  McGraw-Hill, 2002, {{Page needed|date=December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He worked at the court of [[Vincenzo I of Gonzaga]] in [[Mantua]] as a vocalist and [[viol]] player.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cayne, Bernard S. 1990&quot;&gt;Cayne, Bernard S., ed.  ''Encyclopedia Americana Deluxe Library Edition''.  Vol. 19.  Danbury:  Grolier Incorporated, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1602, he was working as the court [[conducting|conductor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cayne, Bernard S. 1990&quot;/&gt;

In 1599 Monteverdi married the court singer Claudia Cattaneo,&lt;ref&gt;Whenham, John, and Richard Wistreich, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to Monteverdi''.  Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; who died in September 1607.&lt;ref&gt;Whenham, John, and Richard Wistreich, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to Monteverdi''.  Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 2007, {{Page needed|date=December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He and his wife had two boys (Francesco and Massimilino) and one girl (Leonora - another daughter died shortly after birth).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ringer, Mark 2006&quot;&gt;Ringer, Mark.  ''Opera's First Master:  The Musical Dramas of Claudio Monteverdi''.  Canada:  Amadeus Press, 2006, {{Page needed|date=December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1613, he had moved to the [[San Marco di Venezia|San Marco]] in [[Venice]] where, as conductor,&lt;ref name=&quot;Redlich, H. F. 1952&quot;&gt;Redlich, H. F.  ''Claudio Monteverdi:  Life and Work''. London:  Oxford University Press, 1952, {{Page needed|date=December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he quickly restored the musical standard of both the choir and the instrumentalists.  The musical standard had declined due to the financial mismanagement of his predecessor, [[Giulio Cesare Martinengo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Redlich, H. F. 1952&quot;/&gt; The managers of the basilica were relieved to have such a distinguished musician in charge, as the music had been declining since the death of [[Giovanni Croce]] in 1609.&lt;ref name=&quot;Redlich, H. F. 1952&quot;/&gt;

In 1632, he became a priest.&lt;ref&gt;Marthaler, Benard L., ed. ''New Catholic Encyclopedia 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; ed.''

It contains tragic, romantic, and comedic scenes (a new development in opera), a more realistic portrayal of the characters, and warmer [[melody|melodies]] than previously heard.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Denis, and Nigel Fortune, eds. ''The New Monteverdi Companion''.  London:  faber and faber, 1985, {{Page needed|date=December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It requires a smaller orchestra, and has a less prominent role for the choir.  For a long period of time, Monteverdi's operas were merely regarded as a historical or musical interest.  Since the 1960s, ''The Coronation of Poppea'' has re-entered the repertoire of major opera companies worldwide.

Monteverdi died in [[Venice]] on 29 November 1643&lt;ref name=&quot;Cayne, Bernard S. 1990&quot;/&gt; and was buried at the church of the [[Frari]].&lt;ref&gt;Halsey, William D., ed.  ''Collier's Encyclopedia''.  Vol. 16.. New York:  MacMillan Educational Company, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the age of forty, Monteverdi worked primarily on [[Madrigal (music)|madrigals]], composing a total of nine books. It took Monteverdi about four years to finish his first book of twenty-one madrigals for five voices.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Schrade, Leo.  ''Monteverdi:  Creator of Modern Music''.  New York:  W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a whole, the first eight books of madrigals show the enormous development from [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music to the [[monody|monodic]] style typical of [[Baroque]] music.

The titles of his Madrigal books are:

====The Fifth Madrigal Book====
{{listen |filename= Monteverdi - cruda amarilli.ogg |title= Cruda Amarilli |description= |format= [[Ogg]]}}
The ''Fifth Book of Madrigals'' shows the shift from the late Renaissance style of music to the early Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;Ringer, Mark.  ''Opera's First Master:  The Musical Dramas of Claudio Monteverdi''.  Canada:  Amadeus Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Quinto Libro'' (Fifth Book), published in 1605, was at the heart of the controversy between Monteverdi and [[Giovanni Artusi]]. Giovanni Artusi attacked the &quot;crudities&quot; and &quot;license&quot; of the modern style of composing, centering his attacks on madrigals (including ''[[Cruda Amarilli]]'', composed around 1600) (See Fabbri, ''Monteverdi'', p.&amp;nbsp;60) from the fourth book.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  Monteverdi made his reply in the introduction to the fifth book, with a proposal of the division of musical practice into two streams, which he called ''[[prima prattica]]'', and ''seconda prattica''. ''Prima prattica'' was described as the previous [[polyphony|polyphonic]] ideal of the sixteenth century, with flowing strict [[counterpoint]], prepared [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]], and equality of voices.  ''Seconda prattica'' used much freer counterpoint with an increasing hierarchy of voices, emphasising [[soprano]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]. In ''Prima Prattica'' the harmony controls the words.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Schrade, Leo.  ''Monteverdi:  Creator of Modern Music''.  New York:  W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1950, {{Page needed|date=December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Seconda Prattica'' the words should be in control of the harmonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;  This represented a move towards the new style of [[monody]]. The introduction of [[figured bass|continuo]] in many of the madrigals was a further self-consciously modern feature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ringer, Mark 2006&quot;/&gt; In addition, the fifth book showed the beginnings of conscious functional tonality.

====The Eighth Madrigal Book====
[[File:Claudio Monteverdi 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Posthumous portrait medallion of Monteverdi, etching by Barberis, (Associazione Amici della Raccolta Bertarelli, [[Milan]]).]]
The ''Ottavo Libro'', published in 1638, includes the so-called ''Madrigali dei guerrieri ed amorosi'' which many consider to be the perfection of the madrigal form.  The ''Eighth Book of Madrigals'' is subtitled ''Madrigals of War and Love''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold, Denis 1967&quot;/&gt; While in Venice, Monteverdi also finished his sixth, seventh and eighth books of madrigals. The eighth is the largest, containing works written over a thirty-year period. Originally the work was to be dedicated to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]], but because of his ill health in 1635 his son was made king in December 1636. When the work was first published in 1638 Monteverdi rededicated it to the new King [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]].&lt;ref&gt;Denis Arnold and [[Nigel Fortune]], Editors. The New Monteverdi Companion. (Boston: Faber and Faber Ltd., 1985), 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is divided into sections of War and Love each containing madrigals, a piece in dramatic form ([[genere rappresentativo]]), and a [[ballet]]. In the Madrigals of War, Monteverdi has organized poetry that describes the pursuits of love through the allegory of war; the hunt for love, and the battle to find love.  In the second half of the book, the Madrigals of Love, Monteverdi organized poetry that describes the unhappiness of being in love, unfaithfulness, and ungrateful lovers that feel no shame.  In his previous madrigal collections, Monteverdi usually set poetry from one or two poets he was in contact with through the court where he was employed. The Book 8 Madrigals of War and Love represent an overview of the poets he has dealt with throughout his life; the classical poetry of Petrarch, poetry by his contemporaries ([[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]], [[Giovanni Battista Guarini|Guarini]], [[Giambattista Marino|Marino]], [[Ottavio Rinuccini|Rinuccini]], [[Testi]] and [[Strozzi]]), or anonymous poets that Monteverdi found and adapted to his needs.

'''Madrigals of War'''
# ''Altri canti d’Amor tenero arciero'' (Let others sing of Love, the tender archer) Anonymous sonnet
## is preceded by a sinfonia introduction that is written for two violins and four viols.  The madrigal that follows serves as an introduction to the first half of the collection and as a dedication to Ferdinand III.''
# ''Hor che’l ciel e la terra e’l vento tace'' (''Now that the sky, earth and wind are silent'') Sonnet by [[Petrarch]],
## is the first significant poetic work of the collection in which Monteverdi splits into two sections. In the first section, his poetry introduces the idea of the wars of love, in which he yearns for someone to love him.
### &quot;''War is my condition full of anger and grief, and only when thinking of her do I find some peace.''&quot;
### In the second section, &quot;''Thus from a single bright and living fountain''&quot; (''Cosi sol d’una chiara fonte viva'') the symbolism of war continues:
#### &quot;''One hand alone cures me and wounds me.  And, because my suffering never reaches its limits, a thousand times daily I die, and a thousand I am born, so far am I from my salvation.''&quot;
# ''Gira il nemico insidioso Amore'' (The insidious enemy, Love, circles the citadel of my heart) [[Canzonetta]] by [[Giulio Strozzi]]
# ''Se vittorie si belle han le guerre d’amore'' (If love’s wars have such beautiful victories) madrigal by [[Fulvio Testi]]
# ''Armato il cor d’adamanina fede'' (My heart armed with adamantine faith) madrigal by [[Ottavio Rinuccini]]
# ''Ogni amante e guerrier: nel suo gran regno'' (Every lover is a warrior: in his great kingdom) madrigal by [[Ottavio Rinuccini]]
# ''Ardo, avvampo, mi struggo, ardo: accorrete'' (I burn, I blaze, I am consumed, I burn; come running) Anonymous Sonnet
# ''[[Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda]]'' (The Combat of Tancredi and Clorinda) from ''Torquato Tasso''’s [[Gerusalemme liberata]], Canto XII
## was originally composed and performed at the home of Girolamo Mocenigo (1624)&lt;ref&gt;[[Paolo Fabbri]], ''Monteverdi'', translated from the Italian by Tim Carter (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 238–39.&lt;/ref&gt; and includes the dramatic scene in which the orchestra and voices form two separate entities, acting as counterparts. Most likely Monteverdi was inspired to try this arrangement because of the two opposite balconies in San Marco. What made this composition also stand out is the first-time use of string ''[[tremolo]]'' (fast repetition of the same tone) and ''[[pizzicato]]'' (plucking strings with fingers) for special effect in dramatic scenes.
# ''Introduzione al ballo e ballo'' (Introduction to the ballet, and ballet) Sonnet by [[Ottavio Rinuccini]]

'''Madrigals of Love'''
# ''Altri canti di Marte e di sua schiera'' (Let others sing of Mars and of his host) Sonnet by [[Giambattista Marino|Marino]]
## the parallel work to ''Altri canti d amor'', it serves as an introduction to the second half of the collection. Like its counterpart, it, too, is preceded by an instrumental ''sinfonia'' and contains a dedication to Ferdinand III.
# ''Vago augelletto che cantando vai'' (Lovely little bird, who are you singing about) Sonnet by [[Petrarch]]
# ''Mentre vaga angioletta'' (While a charming, angelic girl attracts every wellborn soul with her singing) madrigal by [[Giovanni Battista Guarini|Guarini]]
# ''Ardo e scoprir, ahi lasso, io non ardisco'' (I burn and, alas, I do not have the courage to reveal that burning which I bear hidden in my breast) Anonymous, madrigal
# ''O sia tranquillo il mare o pien d’orgoglio'' (Whether the sea be still or swelled with pride) Anonymous, Sonnet
# ''Ninfa che, scalza il piede e sciolto il crine'' (Nymph, who with bare feet and hair undone) Anonymous madrigal
# ''Dolcissimo uscignolo'' (Sweetest nightingale) madrigal by [[Giovanni Battista Guarini|Guarini]]
# ''Chi vol haver felice e lieto il core'' (Whoever wishes to have a happy joyful heart) madrigal by [[Giovanni Battista Guarini|Guarini]]
# ''Non Havea Febo ancora: Lamento della ninfa'' (Phoebus had not yet: The Lament of the Nymph) Canzonetta by [[Rinuccini]]
# ''Perche te n fuggi, o Fillide?'' (Why do you run away, Phyllis?) Anonymous madrigal
# ''Non partir, ritrosetta'' (Do not depart, maiden averse to love) Anonymous canzonetta
# ''Su, Su, Su, pastorelli vezzosi'' (Come, come, come, charming shepherd lads) Anonymous Canzonetta
# ''Il Ballo delle ingrate'' (Entrance and Final ballet of the Ungrateful Women)
## The Ballet of the Ungrateful Women was originally composed for the 1608 wedding of Francesco Gonzaga and was revived in 1628 for a performance in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paolo Fabbri]], ''Monteverdi'', translated by Tim Carter (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 238–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Ninth Madrigal Book====
The ninth book of madrigals, published posthumously in 1651,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; contains lighter pieces such as [[canzonetta]]s which were probably composed throughout Monteverdi's lifetime representing both styles.

===Operas===
{{Main|L'Orfeo|L'Arianna|Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria|L'incoronazione di Poppea}}

====L'Orfeo====
[[Image:Frontispiece of L'Orfeo.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Frontispiece of Monteverdi's opera ''L'Orfeo'', Venice edition, 1609.]]
Monteverdi composed at least eighteen operas, but only ''L'Orfeo'', ''Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria'', ''L'incoronazione di Poppea'', and the famous [[aria]], ''Lamento'', from his second opera ''L'Arianna'' have survived. &lt;!--The lost operas should be named (New Grove lists both more and fewer than five, depending on the exact characterization--e.g., is a &quot;favola marittima&quot; or &quot;favola in musica&quot; an opera?); if the &quot;anatopismo&quot;, Proserpina rapita, is amongst them, then there are *two* surviving fragments published amongst the madrigals. In any case, a source is needed for this claim--&gt;From [[monody]] (with melodic lines, intelligible text and placid accompanying music), it was a logical step for Monteverdi to begin composing [[opera]]. In 1607, the premiere of his first opera, ''L'Orfeo'', took place in Mantua.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  ''L'Orfeo'' was not the first opera, but the first mature opera, or one that realized all of its potential.&lt;ref&gt;Whenham, John.  ''Claudio Monteverdi Orfeo''.  Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 1986, {{Page needed|date=December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was normal at that time for composers to create works on demand for special occasions, and this piece was part of the ducal celebrations of [[carnival]].&lt;ref&gt;Whenham, John.  ''Claudio Monteverdi Orfeo''.  Cambridge:  Cambrdige University Press, 1986,{{Page needed|date=December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Monteverdi was later to write for the first opera houses supported by ticket sales which opened in Venice). ''L'Orfeo'' has dramatic power and lively [[orchestration]].  ''L'Orfeo'' is arguably the first example of a composer assigning specific instruments to parts in operas. It is also one of the first large compositions in which the exact instrumentation of the premiere has come down to us.&lt;ref&gt;Whenham, John.  ''Claudio Monteverdi Orfeo''.  Cambridge:  Cambrdige University Press, 1986, {{Page needed|date=December 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The plot is described in vivid musical pictures and the melodies are linear and clear. With this opera, Monteverdi created an entirely new style of music, the ''dramma per la musica'' or musical drama.

====L'Arianna====
{{listen |filename= Monteverdi_Lamento_d_Arianna_sung_by_the_dwsChorale.ogg |title= ''Lamento d'Arianna'' |description = |format= [[Ogg]]}}''L'Arianna'' was the second opera written by Claudio Monteverdi.  It is one of the most influential and famous specimens of early baroque opera. It was first performed in Mantua in 1608.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ringer, Mark 2006&quot;/&gt; Its subject matter was the ancient Greek legend of Ariadne and Theseus. During the last years of his life, Monteverdi was often ill.  During this time, he composed his two last masterpieces:  ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'' (''The Return of Ulysses'', 1640), and the historic opera, ''L'incoronazione di Poppea'', (''The Coronation of Poppea'', 1642),&lt;ref&gt;Redlich, H. F. ''Claudio Monteveri:  Life and Work''.  London:  Oxford University Press, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; based on an episode in the life of the [[Roman empire|Roman]] [[emperor]] [[Nero]].  The libretto for ''Il ritorno d'Ulisse'' was by Giacomo Badoarro and for ''L'incoronazione di Poppea'' by Giovanni Busenello.&lt;ref&gt;Halsey, William D., ed.  ''Collier's Encyclopedia''. Vol. 16.  New York:  MacMillan Educational Company 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred music===

====Vespro della Beata Vergine====
{{listen |filename= Deus in adiutorium.ogg |title= ''Deus in adiutorium'', from ''Vespro della Beata Vergine'' |description= |format= [[Ogg]] |filename2= Laudate pueri.ogg |title2= ''Laudate pueri'', from ''Vespro della Beata Vergine'' |description2= |format2= [[Ogg]]}}
Monteverdi's first church music publication was the archaic [[Mass (music)|Mass]] ''In illo tempore'' to which the ''Vesper Psalms'' of 1610 were added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halsey, William D. 1991&quot;/&gt;  The ''Vesper Psalms'' of 1610  are also one of the best examples of early repetition and contrast, with many of the parts having a clear ''[[ritornello]]''. The published work is on a very grand scale and there has been some controversy as to whether all the movements were intended to be performed in a single service.  However, there are various indications of internal unity.  In its scope, it foreshadows such summits of Baroque music as [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''.  Each part (there are twenty-five in total) is fully developed in both a musical and dramatic sense - the instrumental textures are used to precise dramatic and emotional effect, in a way that had not been seen before.

The '''Colossus''' machines were [[electronics|electronic]] [[computing]] devices used by British [[Cryptanalysis|codebreakers]] to help read [[encrypted]] [[Nazi Germany|German]] messages during [[World War II]]. They used [[vacuum tube]]s (thermionic valves) to perform the calculations.

Colossus was designed by engineer [[Tommy Flowers]] with input from [http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/nov/08/harry-fensom-obituary Harry Fensom], [[Allen Coombs]], Sid Broadhurst and Bill Chandler&lt;ref&gt;Bletchley's code-cracking Colossus http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8492762.stm&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Post Office Research Station]], [[Dollis Hill]] to solve a problem posed by mathematician [[Max Newman]] at [[Bletchley Park]]. The prototype, '''Colossus Mark 1''', was shown to be working in December 1943 and was operational at Bletchley Park by February 1944. An improved '''Colossus Mark 2''' first worked on 1 June 1944, just in time for the [[Normandy Landings]]. Ten Colossi were in use by the end of the war.

The Colossus [[computer]]s were used to help decipher [[teleprinter]] messages which had been [[encryption|encrypted]] using the [[Lorenz SZ40/42]] machine&amp;mdash;British codebreakers referred to encrypted German teleprinter traffic as &quot;[[Fish (cryptography)|Fish]]&quot; and called the SZ40/42 machine and its traffic &quot;[[TUNNY]]&quot;. Colossus compared two data streams, counting each match based on a programmable [[Boolean function]]. The encrypted message was read at high speed from a paper tape. The other stream was generated internally, and was an electronic simulation of the Lorenz machine at various trial settings. If the match count for a setting was above a certain threshold, it would be sent as output to an electric typewriter.

The Colossus was used to find possible key combinations for the Lorenz machines – rather than decrypting an intercepted message in its entirety.

In spite of the destruction of the Colossus hardware and blueprints as part of the effort to maintain a project secrecy that was kept up into the 1970s—a secrecy that deprived some of the Colossus creators of credit for their pioneering advancements in electronic digital computing during their lifetimes—a functional replica of a Colossus computer was completed in 2007.

==Purpose and origins==
[[Image:SZ42-6-wheels-lightened.jpg|right|280px|thumbnail|The Lorenz machine was used by the Germans to encrypt high-level teleprinter communications. It contained 12 wheels with a total of 501 pins.]]
The Colossus computers were used in the [[cryptanalysis]] of high-level German communications, messages which had been encrypted using the [[Lorenz SZ 40/42]] cipher machine; part of the operation of Colossus was to emulate the [[electromechanical]] Lorenz machine electronically. To encrypt a message with the Lorenz machine, the [[plaintext]] was combined with a stream of key [[bit]]s, grouped in fives. The [[keystream]] was generated using twelve [[pinwheel (cryptography)|pinwheel]]s: five were termed (by the British) χ (&quot;[[chi (letter)|chi]]&quot;) wheels, another five ψ (&quot;[[psi (letter)|psi]]&quot;) wheels, and the remaining two the &quot;motor wheels&quot;. The χ wheels stepped regularly with each letter that was encrypted, while the ψ wheels stepped irregularly, controlled by the motor wheels. 

[[Bill Tutte]], a cryptanalyst at [[Bletchley Park]], discovered that the keystream produced by the machine exhibited statistical biases deviating from random, and that these biases could be used to break the cipher and read messages. In order to read messages, there were two tasks that needed to be performed. The first task was ''wheel breaking'', which was discovering the pin patterns for all the wheels. These patterns were set up once on the Lorenz machine and then used for a fixed period of time and for a number of different messages. The second task was ''wheel setting'', which could be attempted once the pin patterns were known. Each message encrypted using Lorenz was enciphered at a different start position for the wheels. The process of wheel setting found the start position for a message. Initially Colossus was used to help with wheel setting, but later it was found it could also be adapted to the process of wheel breaking as well.

Colossus was developed for the ''[[Newmanry]]'', the section at Bletchley Park responsible for machine methods against the Lorenz machine, headed by the mathematician [[Max Newman]]. It arose out of a prior project which produced a special purpose opto-mechanical comparator and counting machine called ''&quot;[[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]]&quot;''. 

The main problems with the Heath Robinson were the relative slowness of electro-mechanical relays and the difficulty of synchronising two [[punched tape|paper tapes]], one punched with the enciphered message, the other representing the patterns produced by the wheels of the Lorenz machine. The tapes tended to stretch when being read at some 2000 characters per second, resulting in unreliable counts. [[Tommy Flowers]] of the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]] was called in to look into the design of the Robinson’s combining unit. He was not impressed with the machines and, at his own initiative, designed an electronic machine which stored the data from one of the tapes internally. He presented this design to Max Newman in February 1943, but the idea that the one to two thousand [[thermionic valves]] (vacuum tubes) proposed, could work together reliably was greeted with scepticism, so more Robinsons were ordered from Dollis Hill. Flowers, however, persisted with the idea and obtained support from the Director of the Research Station.

==The construction of Colossus==
[[Tommy Flowers]] spent eleven months (early February to December 1943) designing and building Colossus at the [[Post Office Research Station]], [[Dollis Hill]], in northwest London. After a functional test in December 1943, Colossus was dismantled and shipped north to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered on 18 January 1944 and assembled by Harry Fensom and Don Horwood,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Colossus Computer&quot;&gt;The Colossus Rebuild http://www.tnmoc.org/colossus-rebuild.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and attacked its first message on 5 February.&lt;ref name=&quot;Copeland&quot;&gt;Jack Copeland, &quot;Machine against Machine&quot;, p. 75 (entire article pp. 64-77) in B. Jack Copeland, ed., Colossus: The Secrets of Bletchley Park's Codebreaking Computers, Oxford University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mark 1 was followed by nine Mark 2 Colossus machines, the first being commissioned in June 1944, and the original Mark 1 machine was converted into a Mark 2.  An eleventh Colossus was essentially finished at the end of the war. Colossus Mark 1 contained 1,500 electronic valves (tubes).  Colossus Mark 2 with 2,400 valves was both 5 times faster and simpler to operate than Mark 1, greatly speeding the decoding process.  Mark 2 was designed while Mark 1 was being constructed. [[Allen Coombs]] took over leadership of the Colossus Mark 2 project when [[Tommy Flowers]] moved on to other projects. For comparison, later stored-program computers like  the [[Manchester Mark 1]] of 1949 used about 4,200 valves. In comparison, [[ENIAC]] (1946) used 17,468 valves. 

Colossus dispensed with the second tape of the Heath Robinson design by generating the wheel patterns electronically, and processing 5,000 characters per second with the paper tape moving at 40&amp;nbsp;ft/s (12.2&amp;nbsp;m/s or 27.3&amp;nbsp;mph).  The circuits were synchronized by a [[clock signal]] generated by the sprocket holes of the punched tape. The speed of calculation was thus limited by the mechanics of the tape reader.  Tommy Flowers tested the tape reader up to 9,700 characters per second (53&amp;nbsp;mph) before the tape disintegrated.  He settled on 5,000 characters/second as the desirable speed for regular operation.  Sometimes, two or more Colossus computers tried different possibilities simultaneously in what now is called [[parallel computing]], speeding the decoding process by perhaps as much as doubling the rate of comparison.

Colossus included the first ever use of [[shift register]]s and [[systolic array]]s, enabling five simultaneous tests, each involving up to 100 [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean calculations]], on each of the five channels on the punched tape (although in normal operation only one or two channels were examined in any run).

Initially Colossus was only used to determine the initial wheel positions used for a particular message (termed ''wheel setting'').  The Mark 2 included mechanisms intended to help determine pin patterns (''wheel breaking''). Both models were programmable using switches and plug panels in a way the Robinsons had not been.

==Design and operation==
[[Image:ColossusRebuild 11.jpg|right|thumbnail|320px|In 1994, a team led by [[Anthony Sale|Tony Sale]] (right) began a reconstruction of a Colossus at Bletchley Park. Here, in 2006, Sale supervises the breaking of an enciphered message with the completed machine.]]
Colossus used state-of-the-art [[vacuum tube]]s ([[Vacuum tube|thermionic valve]]s), [[thyratron]]s and [[photomultiplier]]s to optically read a paper tape and then applied a programmable logical function to every character, counting how often this function returned &quot;true&quot;. Although machines with many valves were known to have high failure rates, it was recognised that valve failures occurred most frequently with the current surge when powering up, so the Colossus machines, once turned on, were never powered down&lt;ref name=&quot;Copeland&quot;/&gt; unless they malfunctioned.

Colossus was the first of the electronic digital machines with programmability, albeit limited by modern standards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/BriefHistofComp.html#Col A Brief History of Computing. Jack Copeland, June 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;: 
* it had no internally stored programs. To set it up for a new task, the operator had to set up plugs and switches to alter the wiring.
* Colossus was not a general-purpose machine, being designed for a specific cryptanalytic task involving counting and Boolean operations. 

It was thus not a fully general [[Turing-complete]] computer, even though [[Alan Turing]] worked at [[Bletchley Park]]. It was not then realized that Turing completeness was significant; most of the other pioneering modern computing machines were also not Turing complete (e.g. the [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]], the [[Harvard Mark I]] electro-mechanical relay machine, the [[Bell Labs]] relay machines (by [[George Stibitz]] et al.), or the first designs of [[Konrad Zuse]]). The notion of a computer as a general purpose machine—that is, as more than a [[calculator]] devoted to solving difficult but specific problems—did not become prominent for several years.

Colossus was preceded by several computers, many of them first in some category. [[Konrad Zuse|Zuse's]] [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] was the first functional fully program-controlled [[computer]], and was based on electromechanical relays, as were the (less advanced) [[Bell Labs]] machines of the late 1930s ([[George Stibitz]], et al.). The [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]] was electronic and binary (digital) but not programmable.  Assorted [[analog computer]]s were semiprogrammable; some of these much predated the 1930s (e.g., [[Vannevar Bush]]). Babbage's [[Analytical engine]] design predated all these (in the mid-19th century), it was a decimal, programmable, entirely mechanical construction—but was only partially built and never functioned during Babbage's lifetime (the first complete mechanical [[Difference engine|Difference engine No. 2]], built in 1991, does work however). Colossus was the first combining ''digital'', (partially) ''programmable'', and ''electronic''.  The first fully programmable digital electronic computer was the [[ENIAC]] which was completed in 1946.

{{Early computer characteristics}}

==Influence and fate==
The use to which the Colossus computers were put was of the highest secrecy, and the Colossus itself was highly secret, and remained so for many years after the War. Thus, Colossus could not be included in the [[history of computing hardware]] for many years, and Flowers and his associates also were deprived of the recognition they were due.

Being not widely known, it therefore had little direct influence on the development of later computers; [[EDVAC]] was the early design which had the most influence on subsequent computer architecture.

However, the technology of Colossus, and the knowledge that reliable high-speed electronic digital computing devices were feasible, had a significant influence on the development of early computers in Britain and probably in the US. A number of people who were associated with the project and knew all about Colossus played significant roles in early computer work in Britain. In 1972, [[Herman Goldstine]] wrote that:

{{quote|Britain had such vitality that it could immediately after the war embark on so many well-conceived and well-executed projects in the computer field.&lt;ref&gt;''The Computer from Pascal to von Neuman'' (pp. 321)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
In writing that, Goldstine was unaware of Colossus, and its legacy to those projects of people such as [[Alan Turing]] (with the [[Pilot ACE]] and [[ACE (computer)|ACE]]), and Max Newman and [[I. J. Good]] (with the [[Manchester Mark 1]] and other early Manchester computers). [[Brian Randell]] later wrote that:

{{quote|the COLOSSUS project was an important source of this vitality, one that has been largely unappreciated, as has the significance of its places in the chronology of the invention of the digital computer.&lt;ref&gt;''B. Randell, &quot;The Colossus&quot;, in A History of Computing in the Twentieth Century (N. Metropolis, J. Howlett and G. C. Rota, Eds.), pp.47-92, Academic Press, New York, 1980.'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Colossus documentation and hardware were [[classified information|classified]] from the moment of their creation and remained so after the War, when [[Winston Churchill]] specifically ordered the destruction of most of the Colossus machines into &quot;pieces no bigger than a man's hand&quot;; Tommy Flowers personally burned blueprints in a furnace at Dollis Hill. Some parts, sanitised as to their original use, were taken to Newman's [[Royal Society]] [[Computing Machine Laboratory]] at [[Manchester University]].&lt;ref name=ManU&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Computing|publisher=alanturing.net|accessdate=2010-01-26|url=http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/BriefHistofComp.html#ACE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colossus Mark 1 was dismantled and parts returned to the Post Office. Two Colossus computers, along with two replica Tunny machines, were retained, moving to [[GCHQ]]'s new headquarters at [[Eastcote]] in April 1946, and moving again with GCHQ to [[Cheltenham]] between 1952 and 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;copeland173-175&quot;&gt;Copeland, 2006, p. 173-175&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Colossi, known as ''Colossus Blue'', was dismantled in 1959; the other in 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;copeland173-175&quot;/&gt; In their later years, the Colossi were used for training, but before that, there had been attempts to adapt them, with varying success, to other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Horwood, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Good relates how he was the first to use it after the war, persuading [[NSA]] that Colossus could be used to perform a function for which they were planning to build a special purpose machine.&lt;ref name=&quot;copeland173-175&quot;/&gt; Colossus was also used to perform character counts on [[one-time pad]] tape to test for non-randomness.&lt;ref name=&quot;copeland173-175&quot;/&gt;

Throughout this period the Colossus remained secret, long after any of its technical details were of any importance. This was due to the UK's intelligence agencies use of Enigma-like machines which they promoted and sold to other governments, and then broke the codes using a variety of methods. Had the knowledge of the codebreaking machines been widely known, no one would have accepted these machines; rather, they would have developed their own methods for encryption, methods that the UK services might not have been able to break. The need for such secrecy ebbed away as communications moved to digital transmission and all-digital encryption systems became common in the 1960s.

Information about Colossus began to emerge publicly in the late 1970s, after the secrecy imposed was broken when Colonel Winterbotham published his book ''The Ultra Secret''.  More recently, a 500-page technical report on the Tunny cipher and its cryptanalysis &amp;ndash; entitled ''General Report on Tunny'' &amp;ndash; was released by [[GCHQ]] to the national [[Public Record Office]] in October 2000; the complete report is available online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=General Report on Tunny | year =1945 | author=Jack Good | coauthors = [[Donald Michie]], and Geoffrey Timms | url=http://www.ellsbury.com/tunny/tunny-000.htm | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it contains a fascinating [[paean]] to Colossus by the cryptographers who worked with it:

{{quote|It is regretted that it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the fascination of a Colossus at work; its sheer bulk and apparent complexity; the fantastic speed of thin paper tape round the glittering pulleys; the childish pleasure of not-not, span, print main header and other gadgets; the wizardry of purely mechanical decoding letter by letter (one novice thought she was being hoaxed); the uncanny action of the typewriter in printing the correct scores without and beyond human aid; the stepping of the display; periods of eager expectation culminating in the sudden appearance of the longed-for score; and the strange rhythms characterizing every type of run: the stately break-in, the erratic short run, the regularity of wheel-breaking, the stolid rectangle interrupted by the wild leaps of the carriage-return, the frantic chatter of a motor run, even the ludicrous frenzy of hosts of bogus scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reconstruction==
[[Image:ColossusRebuild 12.jpg|right|thumbnail|320px|The Colossus rebuild seen from the rear.]]
Construction of a fully-functional replica&lt;ref name=&quot;The Colossus Computer&quot;/&gt; of a Colossus Mark 2 was undertaken by a team led by [[Tony Sale]].  In spite of the blueprints and hardware being destroyed, a surprising amount of material survived, mainly in engineers' notebooks, but a considerable amount of it in the U.S.  The optical tape reader might have posed the biggest problem, but Dr. Arnold Lynch, its original designer, was able to redesign it to his own original specification.  The reconstruction is on display, in the historically correct place for Colossus No. 9, at [[The National Museum of Computing]], in H Block [[Bletchley Park]] in [[Milton Keynes]], [[Buckinghamshire]].

In November 2007, to celebrate the project completion and to mark the start of a fundraising initiative for [[The National Museum of Computing]], a Cipher Challenge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  | title=Cipher Challenge 
  | url=http://www.tnmoc.org/cipher1.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt; pitted the rebuilt Colossus against radio amateurs worldwide in being first to receive and decode three messages enciphered using the [[Lorenz SZ42]] and transmitted from radio station DL0HNF in the [http://en.hnf.de/default.asp ''Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum''] computer museum. The challenge was easily won by [[radio amateur]] Joachim Schüth, who had carefully prepared&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Nevertheless the victor's 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz [[laptop]], running his own code, took less than a minute to find the settings for all 12 wheels. The German codebreaker said: &quot;My laptop digested ciphertext at a speed of 1.2&amp;nbsp;million characters per second—240 times faster than Colossus. If you scale the CPU frequency by that factor, you get an equivalent clock of 5.8 MHz for Colossus. That is a remarkable speed for a computer built in 1944.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cipher Challenge verified the successful completion of the rebuild project. &quot;On the strength of today's performance Colossus is as good as it was six decades ago&quot;, commented Tony Sale. &quot;We are delighted to have produced a fitting tribute to the people who worked at Bletchley Park and whose brainpower devised these fantastic machines which broke these ciphers and shortened the war by many months.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Latest Cipher Challenge News 16.11.2007 | url=http://www.tnmoc.org/cipher7.htm | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other meanings==
There was a fictional computer named ''Colossus'' in the movie ''[[Colossus: The Forbin Project]]''.  Also see [[List of fictional computers]].

But the most important fictional treatment of the historical connections between cryptanalysis, code-breaking, and the development of the digital computer design during World War II—including the role played by Turing and Bletchley Park—is Neal Stephenson's novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'' (1999).

}}
The '''Canadian Shield''', also called the '''Laurentian Plateau''', or '''Bouclier canadien''' (French), is a vast [[shield (geology)|geological shield]] covered by a thin layer of [[soil]] that forms the nucleus of the [[North American craton|North American or Laurentia craton]]. It is an area mostly composed of [[igneous rock]] which relates to its long volcanic history. It has a deep, common, joined [[bedrock]] region in eastern and central [[Canada]] and stretches North from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Arctic Ocean]], covering over half of Canada; it also extends south into the northern reaches of the United States. Human population is scarce, and industrial development is minimal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/ca/CanadSh.html Canadian Shield] - Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;, while mining is very prevalent.

== Geographical extent ==
The Canadian shield is a [[Physiographic regions of the world|physiographic division]], consisting of five smaller physiographic provinces, the [[Laurentian Upland]], [[Kazan Region]], Davis, Hudson, and James.&lt;ref name=ca-atlas&gt;{{Cite web| authorlink =Atlas of Canada |title=Physiographic Regions Map|author=The Atlas of Canada |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |date=|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/english/maps/reference/anniversary_maps/physiographicregions/map.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shield extends into the [[United States geology|United States]] as the [[Adirondack Mountains]] (connected by the [[Frontenac Axis]]) and the [[Superior Upland#The Superior Upland|Superior Upland]]. The Canadian Shield is U-shaped, but almost semi-circular, which yields an appearance of a [[warrior]]'s shield, and is a subsection of the Laurentia [[craton]] signifying the area of greatest [[glacial]] impact (scraping down to bare rock) creating the thin soils.

The Canadian Shield is a collage of [[Archean]] plates and accreted juvenile arc [[terrane]]s and [[sedimentary basin]]s of Proterozoic age that were progressively amalgamated during the interval 2.45 to 1.24 [[Ga (unit)|Ga]], with the most substantial growth period occurring during the [[Trans-Hudson orogeny]], between ca. 1.90 to 1.80 Ga.&lt;ref name=Corrigan&gt;{{cite journal |author=Corrigan, D. |year=2008 |title=Metallogeny and Tectonic Evolution of the Trans-Hudson Orogen |url=http://www.pdac.ca/pdac/conv/2008/pdf-tech-session/ts-corrigan.pdf | accessdate =2008-03-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080409105436/http://www.pdac.ca/pdac/conv/2008/pdf-tech-session/ts-corrigan.pdf |archivedate = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Shield was the first part of North America to be permanently elevated above sea level and has remained almost wholly untouched by successive encroachments of the sea upon the continent. It is the Earth's greatest area of exposed [[Archaean]] rock. The [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[Rock (geology)|base rocks]] are mostly from the [[Precambrian]] [[Era (geology)|Era]] (between 4.5 billion and 540 million years ago), and have been repeatedly uplifted and eroded. Today it consists largely of an area of low relief {{convert|300|to|610|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level with a few [[monadnock]]s and low mountain ranges (including the [[Torngat Mountains|Torngat]] and [[Laurentian Mountains]]) probably eroded from the plateau during the [[Cenozoic]] era. During the [[Pleistocene]] epoch, continental ice sheets depressed the land surface (see [[Hudson Bay]]), scooped out thousands of lake basins, and carried away much of the region's soil.

When the [[Greenland]] section is included, the Shield is approximately circular bounded on the northeast by the northeast edge of Greenland, with [[Hudson Bay]] in the middle. It covers much of Greenland, [[Labrador]], most of [[Quebec]] north of the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], much of [[Ontario]] including northern sections of the southern peninsula between the [[Great Lakes]], the [[Adirondack Mountains]]&lt;ref&gt;Peterson Field Guide to Geology of Eastern North America by Roberts, David &amp; Roger Tory Peterson.&lt;/ref&gt; of northern [[New York]], the northernmost part of Lower [[Michigan]] and all of [[Upper Michigan]], northern [[Wisconsin]], northeastern [[Minnesota]], the central/northern portions of [[Manitoba]] away from Hudson Bay, northern [[Saskatchewan]], a small portion of northeastern [[Alberta]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abheritage.ca/abnature/shield/shield.htm Alberta Heritage - Alberta Online Encyclopedia] - The Canadian Shield Region of Alberta&lt;/ref&gt; and the mainland northern Canadian territories to the east of a line extended north from the Saskatchewan/Alberta border ([[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]]).&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9019922|author=Encyclopædia Britannica|authorlink=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Canadian Shield|accessdate=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, it covers approximately {{convert|8000000|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}. It covers even more area and stretches to the Western Cordillera in the west and [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] in the east, but the formations are still underground. The underlying rock structure does include Hudson Bay and the submerged area between North America and Greenland&lt;!---, but by some definitions these submerged regions may not ''technically'' be part of the Shield since they are not on the surfaces ---&gt;.

== Geology ==
[[Image:Temagami greenstone belt pillow lava.jpg|thumb|right|Weathered Precambrian [[pillow lava]] in the [[Temagami greenstone belt]]]]
The multitude of rivers and lakes in the entire region is caused by the [[drainage basin|watersheds]] of the area being so young and in a state of sorting themselves out with the added effect of [[post-glacial rebound]]. The Shield was originally an area of very large [[mountain]]s (about {{convert|12000|m|disp=or}})&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Canadian Shield Ontario.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Typical Canadian Shield: pines, lakes, bogs, and rock.]]

Mountains have deep roots and float on the denser [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] much like an [[iceberg]] at [[sea]]. As mountains erode, their roots rise and are eroded in turn. The rocks that now form the surface of the [[Shield (geology)|Shield]] were once far below the Earth's surface.

The high pressures and temperatures at those depths provided ideal conditions for [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralization]]. Although these mountains are now heavily eroded, many large mountains still exist in Canada's far north called the [[Arctic Cordillera]]. This is a vast deeply dissected [[mountain range]], stretching from northernmost [[Ellesmere Island]] to the northernmost tip of [[Labrador]]. The range's highest peak is [[Nunavut]]'s [[Barbeau Peak]] at {{convert|2616|m}} above [[sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bivouac|261|Barbeau Peak}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Precambrian]] rock is the major component of the [[bedrock]].

The [[North American craton]] is the bedrock forming the heart of the North American continent and the Canadian Shield is the largest exposed part of the craton's bedrock.

The Canadian Shield is part of an ancient continent called [[Arctica]], which was formed about 2.5 billion years ago, during the [[Neoarchean]] era. It was split into Greenland, Laurentia, [[Scotland]], [[Siberia]], [[East Antarctica]] and is now roughly situated in the [[Arctic]] around the current [[North Pole]].

== Ecology ==
&lt;!---not quite ready to delete this yet, but it does not seem germane to geology. Definitely of use to a GEOGRAPHY article about the same area---&gt;
The current [[geomorphology|surface expression]] of the Shield is one of very thin soil lying on top of the [[bedrock]], with many bare outcrops. This arrangement was caused by severe [[glacier|glaciation]] during the [[ice age]], which covered the Shield and scraped the rock clean.

The lowlands of the Canadian Shield have a very dense soil that is not suitable for forestation, but it also contains many marshes and bogs. The rest of the region has coarse soil that does not retain moisture well and is frozen as [[permafrost]] year round. Forests are not as dense in the north.

The Shield is covered in parts by vast [[boreal forest]]s in the south that support natural [[ecosystem]]s as well as a major [[logging]] industry. This boreal forest area includes ecoregions such as the [[Eastern Canadian Shield taiga]] that covers northern Quebec and most of Labrador, and the [[Midwestern Canadian Shield forests]] that run westwards from [[Northwestern Ontario]]. [[Hydrography|Hydrographical]] drainage is generally poor, the effects of [[glaciation]] being one of the many reasons. [[Tundra]] typically prevails in the northern regions. Many mammals such as [[caribou]], [[wolverine]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[mink]], [[otter]]s, [[grizzly bear|grizzlies]], [[polar bear]]s and [[American black bear|black bears]] are present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/na/na0612.html National Geographic] - Northern Canadian Shield taiga&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of polar bears (''Ursus maritimus'') the Shield area contains many of the [[Maternity den|denning]] locations such as the [[Wapusk National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=36084 ''Polar Bear: Ursus maritimus'', Globaltwitcher.com, ed. Nicklas Stromberg]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mining and economics ==
The Shield is one of the world's richest areas in terms of [[mineral]] [[ore]]s. It is filled with substantial deposits of [[nickel]], [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[copper]]. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and one of the best known, is [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]]. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the [[Sudbury Basin]] is an ancient [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]. Ejecta from the meteorite impact was found in the [[Rove Formation]] in May 2007. The nearby, but less known [[Temagami Magnetic Anomaly]], has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. This suggests it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.&lt;ref name=&quot;GH&quot;&gt;[http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html 3-D Magnetic Imaging using Conjugate Gradients: Temagami anomaly] Retrieved on 2008-03-12&lt;/ref&gt;

In northeastern Quebec, the giant [[Manicouagan Reservoir]] is the site of an extensive hydroelectric project (Manic-cinq, or Manic-5). This is one of the largest-known [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]s on Earth.

The [[Flin Flon greenstone belt]] in central [[Manitoba]] and east-central [[Saskatchewan]] is one of the largest [[Paleoproterozoic]] volcanic-hosted massive [[sulfide]] (VMS) districts in the world, containing 27 [[copper]]-[[zinc]]-([[gold]]) deposits from which more than 183 million tons{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}&lt;!--metric, short or long tons?--&gt; of sulfide have been mined.&lt;ref name=Norris&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Norris, Jessica |title=Report on the 2007 Diamond Drilling Program McClarty Lake Project, Manitoba |publisher=Aurora Geosciences Ltd. |year=2007 |url=http://www.troymet.com/i/pdf/2007McClarty43-101.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shield, particularly the portion in the [[Northwest Territories]], has recently been the site of several major [[diamond]] discoveries. The [[kimberlite]] pipes in which the diamonds are found are closely associated with cratons, which provide the deep [[lithosphere|lithospheric]] [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] required to stabilize diamond as a [[mineral]]. The kimberlite eruptions then bring the diamonds from over {{convert|150|km}} depth to the surface. Currently the [[Ekati Diamond Mine|Ekati]] and [[Diavik Diamond Mine|Diavik]] mines are actively mining kimberlite diamonds.

A '''comic book''' or '''comicbook'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.eagleawards.co.uk/category/previous-winners/ | title=Previous Winners | work=The [[Eagle Awards]] | accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (often shortened to simply '''comic''' and sometimes called a '''funny book''', '''comic paper''', or '''comic magazine''') is a [[magazine]] made up of [[comics]], narrative artwork in the form of separate [[panel (comics)|panels]] that represent individual scenes, often accompanied by [[dialog]] (usually in [[word balloon]]s, emblematic of the comic book art form) as well as including brief descriptive prose. The first comic book appeared in the [[United States]] in 1932, reprinting the earlier newspaper [[comic strip]]s, which established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term &quot;comic book&quot; arose because the first comic books reprinted humor comic strips. Despite their name, however, comic books do not necessarily operate in humorous mode; most modern comic books tell stories in a variety of genres. The [[Manga|Japanese]] and [[European comics|European]] comic book markets demonstrate this clearly. In the United States, the [[superhero]] genre dominates the market.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Since the introduction of the comic book format in 1934 with the publication of ''[[Famous Funnies]]'', the United States has produced the most titles, with only the [[British comic]] and Japanese [[manga]] as close competitors in terms of quantity of titles. The comic book industry in the U.S. markets the majority of its output to [[Young-adult fiction|young adult]] readers, though it also produces titles for young children, as well as catering to adult audiences.

Cultural historians divide the career of the comic book in the U.S. into several ages or [[List of time periods|historical eras]]:

* [[American_comics#Proto-comic_books_and_the_Platinum_Age|Proto-comic books and the Platinum Age]]
* [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]]
* [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]]
* [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Bronze Age]]
* [[Copper Age of Comic Books|Copper Age]]
* [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]]

Comic book historians continue to debate the exact boundaries of these eras, but they have come to an agreement. The terms for which originated in the [[fandom]] [[publishing|press]]. Comic books as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois|The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck]]'' in 1842 in hardcover—making it the first known American prototype comic book. It is not considered a comic book. The introduction of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s [[Superman]] in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Goulart | first=Ron | authorlink=Ron Goulart | title=Comic Book Culture: An Illustrated History | date=1 June 2000 | publisher=Collectors Press | page=43 | isbn=978-1888054385}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often presented{{By whom|date=April 2010}} as the start of the Golden Age of comics. Historians have proposed several names for the Age before Superman, most commonly dubbing it the Platinum Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.thecomicbooks.com/old/Platinum.html | title=The History of Comic Books | last=Coville | first=Jamie | work=TheComicBooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Platinum Age saw the first use of the term &quot;comic book&quot; (''The Yellow Kid in McFadden's Flats'' (1897)), the first known full-color comic (''The Blackberries'' (1901)), and the first monthly comic book (''Comics Monthly'' (1922)), it was not until the Golden Age that the [[archetype]] of the superhero would originate.

The Silver Age of comic books is generally considered{{By whom|date=April 2010}} to date from the first successful revival of the dormant superhero form—the debut of [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Carmine Infantino]]'s [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #4 (September/October 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | title=DC Flashback: The Flash | accessdate=27 June 2008 | last=CBR News Team | date=2 July 2007 | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706  | title=Breaking the Border - Rants and Ramblings | accessdate=5 January 2010 | last=Zicari | first=Anthony | date=3 August 2007 | publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070826092448/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706 |archivedate = 26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silver Age lasted through the early 1970s, during which time [[Marvel Comics]] revolutionized the medium with such [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] superheroes as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Fantastic Four]] and Stan Lee and [[Steve Ditko]]'s [[Spider-Man]].

The precise beginnings of the Bronze and Modern Ages remain less well-defined. Suggested starting points for the Bronze Age of comics include [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]'' #1 (October 1970), [[Denny O'Neil]] and [[Neal Adams]]' ''[[Green Lantern]]/[[Green Arrow]]'' #76 (April 1970), or Stan Lee and [[Gil Kane]]'s ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #96 (May 1971; the non-[[Comics Code]] issue). The start of the Modern Age (occasionally referred to as the &quot;Iron Age&quot;) has even more potential starting points, but is generally agreed to be the publication of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' [[graphic novel]] and [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Watchmen]]'' by [[DC Comics]] in 1986, as well as the publication of DC's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', written by [[Marv Wolfman]] with pencils by [[George Pérez]].

Comics published after [[World War II]] in 1945 sometimes get labeled as products of the &quot;Atomic Age&quot; (referring to the dropping of the [[atomic bomb]]), while commentators{{Who|date=June 2009}} sometimes refer to titles published after November 1961 as belonging to the &quot;Marvel Age&quot; (referring to the advent of Marvel Comics). However, the secondary literature refers to these eras far less frequently than to the aforementioned designations.

A notable event in the history of the American comic book came with the psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s criticisms of the medium in his book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954), which prompted the American [[Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]] to investigate comic books. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954 and drafted the &quot;Comics Code&quot; in the same year.

===Underground comics===
{{Main|Underground comix}}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as [[underground comics]]. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth [[counterculture]] and [[drug culture]] of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the [[pornographic]] and even more obscure &quot;[[Tijuana bibles]]&quot;. Underground comics were almost never sold at news stands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as [[head shops]] and record stores, as well as by [[mail order]].

[[Frank Stack]]'s ''The Adventures of Jesus'', published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shelton&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Stack | first1=Frank | authorlink1=Frank Stack | last2=Shelton | first2=Gilbert | authorlink2=Gilbert Shelton | title=The New Adventures of Jesus | date=25 December 2006 | publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] | page=9 | chapter=Introduction | isbn=978-1560977803}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skinn-34&quot;/&gt; has been credited as the first underground comic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shelton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skinn-34&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Skinn | first=Dez | authorlink=Dez Skinn | title=Comix: The Underground Revolution | date=20 May 2004 | publisher=[[Thunder's Mouth Press]] | page=34 | chapter=Heroes of the Revolution | isbn=978-1560255727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative comics===
{{Main|Alternative comics}}

The rise of comic book [[specialty store]]s in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for &quot;independent&quot; or &quot;[[alternative comics]]&quot; in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st Century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics, though their content was generally less explicit, and others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') were experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].

During the 1970s the &quot;small press&quot; culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers, such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color superhero, [[detective]], and [[science fiction]] comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].

A number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The &quot;[[minicomic]]s&quot; form, an extremely informal version of self-publishing, arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s, despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.

{{As of| 2009}} small publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], [[Raytoons]], and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].

===Graphic novels===

In 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; to distinguish newly translated European works from what Kyle perceived as the more juvenile subject matter common in American comics. [[Will Eisner]] popularized the term when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work ''[[A Contract with God|A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories]]'' in 1978. This represented a more thematically mature work than many had come to expect from the comics medium, and the critical success of ''A Contract with God'' helped to bring the term into common usage.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Rarest American comic books===
The rarest{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The &quot;Pay Copy&quot; of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=818&amp;Lot_No=2020&amp;type=prte-pr091305a]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters.

===Franco-Belgian Comics===
{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}

[[France]] and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessinées'') in [[French language|French]] and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone &quot;Franco-Belgian&quot; comics, but have their own distinct style.

The name ''la bande dessinée'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as &quot;the drawn strip&quot;), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word &quot;bande&quot; can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms &quot;comics&quot; and &quot;funnies&quot;, which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvième art'' (literally, &quot;the ninth art&quot;) is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In [[North America]], the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in [[Europe]] there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.

In France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.

===British comics===
{{Main|History of the British comic}}

Originally the same size as a usual comic book in the U.S. (although lacking the glossy cover), the British comic has adopted a magazine size, with ''[[The Beano]]'' and ''[[The Dandy]]'' the last to adopt this size (in the 1980s). Although the British generally speak of &quot;a comic&quot; or of &quot;a comic magazine&quot;, and they also historically spoke of &quot;a comic paper&quot;. Some comics, such as ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and other ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' titles, have been published in a [[tabloid]] form.

Although ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'' (1884), the first comic published in Britain, was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger market, which has led to most publications being for children and created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile.

Popular titles within the [[UK]] have included ''The Beano'', ''The Dandy'', ''[[Eagle (comic)|The Eagle]]'', ''2000 AD'', and ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]''. Underground comics and &quot;[[British small press comics|small press]]&quot; titles have also been published within the UK, notably ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' and ''[[Escape Magazine]]''.

The content of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long.

The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies were involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe &amp; Porter.

Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and [[Dark Horse Comics]] also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although the ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'' serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.

At [[Christmas]] time, publishers repackage and commission material for comic [[Annual publication|annuals]], printed and bound as hardcover [[ISO 216#The A series|A4]]-size books; [[Rupert Bear|Rupert]] supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. [[DC Thomson]] also repackages ''[[The Broons]]'' and ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.

===Italian comics===
{{Main|Italian comics}}

In [[Italy]], comics (known in Italian as ''fumetti'') made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories inspired by those coming from the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} After World War II, however, artists like [[Hugo Pratt]] and [[Guido Crepax]] exposed Italian comics to an international audience. &quot;Author&quot; comics{{Clarify|reason=Explain this term|date=August 2010}} contain often strong erotic contents. Popular comic books such as ''[[Diabolik]]'' or the ''[[Sergio Bonelli Editore|Bonelli]]'' line—namely ''[[Tex Willer]]'' or ''[[Dylan Dog]]''—remain best-sellers.

Mainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white [[digest size]] format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's ''[[Corto Maltese]]''.

Italian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, [[Spain]], and [[Argentina]]. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of [[Walt Disney]] comic stories outside the U.S. [[Donald Duck]]'s superhero alter ego, [[Paperinik]], known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.

===Other European comics===
Although [[Switzerland]] has made relatively few contributions to European comics, many scholars{{Who|date=March 2009}} point to a Francophone Swiss, [[Rodolphe Töpffer]], as the true father of comics. However, this assertion remains controversial, with critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} noting that Töpffer's work does not necessarily connect to the creation of the art form as it is now known in the{{Which?|date=May 2010}} region.

==Japanese comics==
{{Main|Manga}}

The first comic books in [[Japan]] appeared during the 18th Century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as {{Nihongo|&quot;red books&quot;|赤本|akahon}}, {{Nihongo|&quot;black books&quot;|黒本|kurobon}}, and {{Nihongo|&quot;blue books&quot;|青本|aohon}}, these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book {{Nihongo|''Master Flashgold's Splendiferous Dream''|金々先生栄花の夢|Kinkin sensei eiga no yume}}, an adult form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the {{nihongo3|lit. ''yellow cover''|黄表紙|[[kibyōshi]]}}. Published in thousands (possibly{{Or|date=May 2010}} tens of thousands) of copies, the ''kibyōshi'' may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain [[Extant literature|extant]].

Modern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints {{Nihongo|''[[ukiyo-e]]''|浮世絵|}} with Western styles of drawing. They took their {{As of| 2009 | alt=current}} form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term ''manga'' means &quot;random (or whimsical) pictures&quot;, and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as [[Santō Kyōden]]'s picturebook {{Nihongo|''Shiji no yukikai''|四時交加|}} (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's ''Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women'' (1798).

Development of this form occurred as a result of Japan's attempts to modernize itself{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, a desire awakened by trade with the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Western artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in ''ukiyo-e'', as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as ''Ponchi-e'' (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or [[Yonkoma|four-picture format]].

Dr. [[Osamu Tezuka]] (1928–1989), widely acknowledged{{By whom|date=March 2009}} as the father of narrative manga, further developed this form. Seeing an [[animation|animated]] war [[propaganda]] film titled {{Nihongo|''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]''|桃太郎 海の神兵|''Momotarō Umi no Shinpei''}} inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human nose|nose]], and [[mouth]] are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka’s work generated new interest in the ''ukiyo-e'' tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.

Though a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become [[television]] shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.

Manga magazines—also known as &quot;anthologies&quot;, or colloquially, &quot;phone books&quot;{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}—often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines are usually printed{{By whom|date=October 2009}} on low-quality newsprint and range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for [[List of manga series by volume count|many years]] if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called {{nihongo3|lit. ''stand-alone book''|単行本|[[tankōbon]]}}, the equivalent of the American [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions. Conversely, old manga titles are also reprinted using lower-quality paper and sold for 120 [[yen|¥]] (approximately $1 [[US$|USD]]) each.

===Genres of manga===
Manga titles are primarily classified{{By whom|date=December 2009}} according to the [[demographics]] of their intended audience. The most popular forms of manga target the markets of young boys ([[shōnen manga]]) and young girls ([[shōjo manga]]). Other categories include adult comics ([[seinen manga]] and [[josei manga]]) and &quot;businessman&quot; comics. Each of these types occupy their own shelves in most Japanese bookstores. Comics with adult content ([[ero manga]]) usually sell in ''doujinshi'' stores rather than normal bookstores.

===Doujinshi===
{{Main|Doujinshi}}

{{nihongo3|lit. ''fan magazine''|同人誌|Doujinshi}}, fan-made Japanese comics operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American &quot;underground comics&quot; market; the largest doujinshi fair, [[Comic Market]], attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.

In [[topology]] and related branches of [[mathematics]], a '''connected space''' is a [[topological space]] that cannot be represented as the [[union (set theory)|union]] of two or more [[disjoint set|disjoint]] nonempty [[open (topology)|open]] subsets. Connectedness is one of the principal [[topological properties]] that is used to distinguish topological spaces. A stronger notion is that of a '''path-connected space''', which is a space where any two points can be joined by a [[path (topology)|path]].

A subset of a topological space ''X'' is a '''connected set''' if it is a connected space when viewed as a [[Subspace topology|subspace]] of ''X''.

As an example of a space that is not connected, one can delete an infinite line from the plane. Other examples of disconnected spaces (that is, spaces which are not connected) include the plane with a closed [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] removed, as well as the union of two disjoint open [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] in two-dimensional Euclidean space.

==Formal definition==
A [[topological space]] ''X'' is said to be '''disconnected''' if it is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of two [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[nonempty]] [[open set]]s. Otherwise, ''X'' is said to be '''connected'''.  A [[subset]] of a topological space is said to be connected if it is connected under its [[subspace (topology)|subspace topology]]. Some authors specifically exclude the [[empty set]] with its unique topology as a connected space, but this encyclopedia does not follow that practice.

For a topological space ''X'' the following conditions are equivalent:

#''X'' is connected.
#''X'' cannot be divided into two disjoint nonempty [[closed set]]s.
#The only subsets of ''X'' which are both open and closed ([[clopen set]]s) are ''X'' and the empty set.
#The only subsets of ''X'' with empty [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] are ''X'' and the empty set.
#''X'' cannot be written as the union of two nonempty [[separated sets]].
#The only continuous functions from ''X'' to {0,1} are constant.

===Connected components===
The [[maximal element|maximal]] connected subsets of a nonempty topological space are called the '''connected components''' of the space.
The components of any topological space ''X'' form a [[partition of a set|partition]] of&amp;nbsp;''X'': they are [[disjoint]], nonempty, and their union is the whole space. (For an empty topological space this partition consists of zero connected components.)
Every component is a [[closed subset]] of the original space. It follows that, in the case where their number is finite, each component is also an open subset. However, if their number is infinite, this might not be the case; for instance, the connected components of the set of the [[rational number]]s are the one-point sets, which are not open.

Let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_x&lt;/math&gt; be a connected component of ''x'' in a topological space ''X'', and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_x'&lt;/math&gt; be the intersection of all open-closed sets containing ''x'' (called [[Locally connected space|quasi-component]] of ''x''.) Then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_x \subset \Gamma'_x&lt;/math&gt; where the equality holds if ''X'' is compact Hausdorff or locally connected.

===Disconnected spaces===
A space in which all components are one-point sets is called [[totally disconnected]]. Related to this property, a space ''X'' is called '''totally separated''' if, for any two elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''X'', there exist disjoint [[neighborhood (topology)|open neighborhood]]s ''U'' of ''x'' and ''V'' of ''y'' such that ''X'' is the union of ''U'' and ''V''. Clearly any totally separated space is totally disconnected, but the converse does not hold. For example take two copies of the rational numbers '''Q''', and identify them at every point except zero. The resulting space, with the quotient topology, is totally disconnected. However, by considering the two copies of zero, one sees that the space is not totally separated.  In fact, it is not even [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and the condition of being totally separated is strictly stronger than the condition of being Hausdorff.

==Examples==

* The closed interval [0,&amp;nbsp;2] in the [[Euclidean space|standard]] [[subspace topology]] is connected; although it can, for example, be written as the union of [0, 1) and [1,&amp;nbsp;2], the second set is not open in the aforementioned topology of [0, 2].
*The union of [0,&amp;nbsp;1) and (1,&amp;nbsp;2] is disconnected; both of these intervals are open in the standard topological space [0,&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;(1,&amp;nbsp;2].
* (0,&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{3} is disconnected.
* A [[convex set]] is connected; it is actually [[simply connected set|simply connected]].
* A [[Euclidean space|Euclidean plane]] excluding the origin, (0,&amp;nbsp;0), is connected, but is not simply connected. The three-dimensional Euclidean space without the origin is connected, and even simply connected. In contrast, the one-dimensional Euclidean space without the origin is not connected.
* A Euclidean plane with a straight-line removed is not connected since it consists of two half-planes.
* The space of [[real number]]s with the usual topology is connected.
* Any [[topological vector space]] over a connected field is connected.
* Every [[discrete topological space]] with at least two elements is disconnected, in fact such a space is [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]].  The simplest example is the [[discrete two-point space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Topology and Modern Analysis|author=George F. Simmons|publisher=McGraw Hill Book Company|date=1968|page=144|isbn=0898745519}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Cantor set]] is totally disconnected; since the set contains uncountably many points, it has uncountably many components.
* If a space ''X'' is [[homotopy|homotopy equivalent]] to a connected space, then ''X'' is itself connected.
* The [[topologist's sine curve]] is an example of a set that is connected but is neither path connected nor locally connected.
* The [[general linear group]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt; (that is, the group of ''n''-by-''n'' real matrices) consists of two connected components: the one with matrices of positive determinant and the other of negative determinant. In particular, it is not connected. In contrast, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{GL}(n, \mathbf{C})&lt;/math&gt; is connected. More generally, the set of invertible bounded operators on a (complex) Hilbert space is connected.
* The spectrum of a commutative [[local ring]] is connected. More generally, the spectrum of a commutative ring is connected if and only if it has no [[idempotent]] &lt;math&gt;\ne 0, 1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the ring is not a product of two rings.

== Path connectedness ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Covering space]] and [[path-connected]] --&gt;
[[File:Path-connected space.svg|thumb|This subspace of '''R'''² is path-connected, because a path can be drawn between any two points in the space.]]

A '''[[path (topology)|path]]''' from a point ''x'' to a point ''y''  in a [[topological space]] ''X'' is  a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]] ''f'' from the [[unit interval]] [0,1] to ''X'' with ''f''(0) = ''x'' and ''f''(1) = ''y''. A '''path-component''' of ''X'' is an [[equivalence class]] of ''X'' under the [[equivalence relation]] which makes ''x''  equivalent to ''y'' if there is a path from ''x'' to ''y''. The space ''X'' is said to be '''path-connected''' (or '''pathwise connected''' or '''0-connected''') if there is only one path-component, i.e. if there is a path joining any two points in ''X''. 

Every path-connected space is connected. The converse is not always true: examples of connected spaces that are not path-connected include the extended [[long line (topology)|long line]] ''L''* and the ''[[topologist's sine curve]]''.

However, subsets of the [[real line]] '''R''' are connected [[if and only if]] they are path-connected; these subsets are the [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]] of '''R'''.
Also, [[open subset]]s of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; or '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; are connected if and only if they are path-connected.
Additionally, connectedness and path-connectedness are the same for [[Wiktionary:finite|finite]] topological spaces.

A space ''X'' is said to be '''arc-connected''' or '''arcwise connected''' if any two distinct points can be joined by an ''arc'', that is a path ''f'' which is a [[homeomorphism]] between the unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] and its image ''f''([0,&amp;nbsp;1]). It can be shown any [[Hausdorff space]] which is path-connected is also arc-connected. An example of a space which is path-connected but not arc-connected is provided by adding a second copy 0' of 0 to the nonnegative real numbers &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0,&amp;nbsp;∞&lt;nowiki&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;. One endows this set with a [[partially ordered set|partial order]] by specifying that 0'&lt;''a'' for any positive number ''a'', but leaving 0 and 0' incomparable. One then endows this set with the ''order topology'', that is one takes the open intervals
(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') = {''x'' | ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''}  and the half-open intervals &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;nowiki&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt; = {''x'' | 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''a''}, &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0',&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;nowiki&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt; = {''x'' | 0'&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''a''} as a [[base (topology)|base]] for the topology. The resulting space is a [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] space but not a [[Hausdorff space]]. Clearly 0 and 0' can be connected by a path but not by an arc in this space.

== Local connectedness ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Covering space]] --&gt;

{{main|Locally connected space}}

A topological space is said to be '''[[Locally connected space|locally connected]] at a point''' ''x'' if every neighbourhood of ''x'' contains a connected open neighbourhood. It is '''locally connected''' if it has a [[base (topology)|base]] of connected sets. It can be shown that a space ''X'' is locally connected if and only if every component of every open set of ''X'' is open. The [[topologist's sine curve]] is an example of a connected space that is not locally connected.

Similarly, a topological space is said to be '''{{visible anchor|locally path-connected}}''' if it has a base of path-connected sets.
An open subset of a locally path-connected space is connected if and only if it is path-connected.
This generalizes the earlier statement about '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, each of which is locally path-connected. More generally, any [[topological manifold]] is locally path-connected.

== Theorems ==
*''Main theorem'': Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be topological spaces and let ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' be a [[continuous (topology)|continuous function]]. If ''X'' is (path-)connected then the [[image (mathematics)|image]] ''f''(''X'') is (path-)connected. This result can be considered a generalization of the [[intermediate value theorem]].
*If  &lt;math&gt;\{A_i\}_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of connected subsets of a topological space ''X'' indexed by an arbitrary set &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;,   &lt;math&gt; A_i \cap A_{j} &lt;/math&gt; is nonempty, then &lt;math&gt; \cup A_i&lt;/math&gt; is also connected.
*If &lt;math&gt;\{A_\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is a nonempty family of connected subsets of a topological space ''X'' such that &lt;math&gt; \cap A_\alpha &lt;/math&gt; is nonempty, then &lt;math&gt; \cup A_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is also connected.
*[[Connected_space/Proofs#Every_path-connected_space_is_connected|Every path-connected space is connected]].
*Every locally path-connected space is locally connected.
*[[Connected_space/Proofs#A_locally_path-connected_space_is_path-connected_if_and_only_if_it_is_connected|A locally path-connected space is path-connected if and only if it is connected]].
*The [[closure (topology)|closure]] of a connected subset is connected.
*The connected components are always [[closed set|closed]] (but in general not open)
*The connected components of a locally connected space are also open.
*The connected components of a space are disjoint unions of the path-connected components (which in general are neither open nor closed).
*Every [[quotient space|quotient]] of a connected (resp. path-connected) space is connected (resp. path-connected).
*Every  [[product topology|product]] of a family of connected (resp. path-connected) spaces is connected (resp. path-connected).
*Every open subset of a locally connected (resp. locally path-connected) space is locally connected (resp. locally path-connected).
*Every [[manifold]] is locally path-connected.

==Graphs==
[[Graph (mathematics)|Graphs]] have path connected subsets, namely those subsets for which every pair of points has a path of edges joining them.
But it is not always possible to find a topology on the set of points which induces the same connected sets. The [[cyclic graph|5-cycle]] graph (and any ''n''-cycle with ''n''&gt;3 odd) is one such example.

As a consequence, a notion of connectedness can be formulated independently of the topology on a space. To wit, there is a category of connective spaces consisting of sets with collections of connected subsets satisfying connectivity axioms; their morphisms are those functions which map connected sets to connected sets {{harv|Muscat|Buhagiar|2006}}. Topological spaces and graphs are special cases of connective spaces; indeed, the finite connective spaces are precisely the finite graphs.

However, every graph can be canonically made into a topological space, by treating vertices as points and edges as copies of the [[unit interval]] (see [[topological graph theory#Graphs as topological spaces]]). Then one can show that the graph is connected (in the graph theoretical sense) if and only if it is connected as a topological space.

== Stronger forms of connectedness ==
There are stronger forms of connectedness for [[topological space]]s, for instance: 
* If there exist no two disjoint non-empty open sets in a topological space, ''X'', ''X'' must be connected, and thus '''[[hyperconnected space]]s''' are also connected. 
* Since a '''[[simply connected space]]''' is, by definition, also required to be path connected, any simply connected space is also connected. Note however, that if the &quot;path connectedness&quot; requirement is dropped from the definition of simple connectivity, a simply connected space does not need to be connected. 
*Yet stronger versions of connectivity include the notion of a '''[[contractible space]]'''. Every contractible space is path connected and thus also connected. 

In general, note that any path connected space must be connected but there exist connected spaces that are not path connected. The [[Comb space|deleted comb space]] furnishes such an example, as does the above mentioned [[topologist's sine curve]].

The central and rightmost cell are in [[interphase]], thus their entire nuclei are labeled. On the left, a cell is going through [[mitosis]] and its DNA has condensed ready for division.]]
[[Image:biological cell.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic of typical animal cell, showing subcellular components. [[Organelle]]s: (1) [[nucleolus]] (2) '''nucleus''' (3) [[ribosome]] (4) [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] (5) rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) (6) [[Golgi apparatus]] (7) [[Cytoskeleton]] (8) [[smooth ER]] (9) [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] (10) [[vacuole]] (11) [[cytoplasm]] (12) [[lysosome]] (13) [[centriole]]s]]

In [[cell biology]], the  '''nucleus''' (pl. ''nuclei''; from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|''nucleus''}} or {{lang|la|''nuculeus''}}, meaning kernel) is a membrane-enclosed [[organelle]] found in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cells]]. It contains most of the cell's [[genetics|genetic material]], organized as multiple long linear [[DNA]] molecules in complex with a large variety of [[protein]]s, such as [[histone]]s, to form [[chromosome]]s. The [[gene]]s within these chromosomes are the cell's [[genome|nuclear genome]]. The function of the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of these genes and to control the activities of the cell by regulating [[gene expression]]&amp;nbsp;— the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the [[nuclear envelope]], a double [[Cell membrane|membrane]] that encloses the entire organelle and separates its contents from the cellular [[cytoplasm]], and the [[nuclear lamina]], a meshwork within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the [[cytoskeleton]], which supports the cell as a whole. Because the nuclear membrane is impermeable to most molecules, [[nuclear pore]]s are required to allow movement of molecules across the envelope. These pores cross both of the membranes, providing a channel that allows free movement of small molecules and [[ion]]s. The movement of larger molecules such as proteins is carefully controlled, and requires active transport regulated by carrier proteins. [[Nuclear transport]] is crucial to cell function, as movement through the pores is required for both gene expression and chromosomal maintenance.

Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound subcompartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of ''subnuclear bodies'' exist, made up of unique proteins, [[RNA]] molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the [[nucleolus]], which is mainly involved in the assembly of [[ribosome]]s. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mRNA.

==History==
[[File:Leeuwenhoek1719RedBloodCells.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Oldest known depiction of cells and their nuclei by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], 1719.]]
[[Image:Flemming1882Tafel1Fig14.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a ''[[Chironomus]]'' salivary gland cell published by [[Walther Flemming]] in 1882. The nucleus contains [[Polytene chromosome]]s.
]]
The nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. The probably oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632&amp;nbsp;– 1723). He observed a &quot;Lumen&quot;, the nucleus, in the [[red blood cell]]s of [[salmon]].&lt;ref&gt;Leeuwenhoek, A. van: Opera Omnia, seu Arcana Naturae ope exactissimorum Microscopiorum detecta, experimentis variis comprobata, Epistolis ad varios illustres viros. J. Arnold et Delphis, A. Beman, Lugdinum Batavorum 1719–1730. Cited after: Dieter Gerlach, Geschichte der Mikroskopie. Verlag Harry Deutsch, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, 2009. ISBN 978-3-8171-1781-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike mammalian red blood cells, those of other vertebrates still possess nuclei.
The nucleus was also described by [[Franz Bauer]] in 1804&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Harris | first =H | title =The Birth of the Cell | edition = | year =1999 | publisher =Yale University Press | location =New Haven | isbn =0-300-07384-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in more detail in 1831 by Scottish [[botanist]] [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] in a talk at the [[Linnean Society of London]]. Brown was studying [[orchid]]s under microscope when he observed an opaque area, which he called the areola or nucleus, in the cells of the flower's outer layer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert Brown&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last =  Brown | first = Robert | title = On the Organs and Mode of Fecundation of Orchidex and Asclepiadea | journal = Miscellaneous Botanical Works I | volume =  | pages = 511–514 | year = 1866}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He did not suggest a potential function. In 1838, [[Matthias Schleiden]] proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name &quot;Cytoblast&quot; (cell builder). He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around &quot;cytoblasts&quot;. [[Franz Meyen]] was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the &quot;cytoblast&quot; or otherwise, contradicted work by [[Robert Remak]] (1852) and [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1855) who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells (&quot;Omnis cellula e cellula&quot;). The function of the nucleus remained unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cremer&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Cremer| first =Thomas | title =Von der Zellenlehre zur Chromosomentheorie | edition = | year =1985 | publisher =Springer Verlag | location =Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, Tokyo | isbn = 3-540-13987-7}} Online Version [http://www.t-cremer.de/main_de/cremer/personen/info_T_Cremer.htm#book here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1876 and 1878, [[Oscar Hertwig]] published several studies on the [[fertilization]] of [[sea urchin]] eggs, showing that the nucleus of the [[sperm]] enters the [[oocyte]] and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a (single) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s theory that the complete [[phylogeny]] of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a &quot;Monerula&quot;, a structureless mass of primordial mucus (&quot;Urschleim&quot;). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, e.g., [[amphibians]] and [[molluscs]]. [[Eduard Strasburger]] produced the same results for plants (1884). This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, [[August Weismann]] postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ ''cells'' for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after [[mitosis]] was discovered and the [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian rules]] were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the chromosome theory of heredity was developed.&lt;ref name =&quot;Cremer&quot;/&gt;

==Structures==
The nucleus is the largest cellular [[organelle]] in animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lodish&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Lodish   | first = H  | coauthors = Berk A, Matsudaira P, Kaiser CA, Krieger M, Scott MP, Zipursky SL, Darnell J.   | title = Molecular Cell Biology  | publisher = WH Freeman  | edition = 5th  | year = 2004  | location = New York  | isbn = 0-7167-2672-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[mammal]]ian cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 micrometers (μm), which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume.&lt;ref name=&quot;MBoC&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 2002 | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell, Chapter 4, pages 191–234 | editor = Bruce Alberts, Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, Peter Walter | publisher = Garland Science | edition = 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The viscous liquid within it is called [[nucleoplasm]], and is similar in composition to the [[cytosol]] found outside the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clegg JS |title=Properties and metabolism of the aqueous cytoplasm and its boundaries |journal=Am.

===Nuclear envelope and pores===

The [[nuclear envelope]] otherwise known as nuclear membrane consists of two [[cell membrane|cellular membranes]], an inner and an outer membrane, arranged parallel to one another and separated by 10 to 50 nanometers (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent [[macromolecule]]s from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paine&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | author = Paine P, Moore L, Horowitz S | title = Nuclear envelope permeability | journal = Nature | volume = 254 | issue = 5496 | pages = 109–114 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1117994 | doi = 10.1038/254109a0  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] (RER), and is similarly studded with [[ribosomes]]. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].

[[Nuclear pores]], which provide aqueous channels through the envelope, are composed of multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. The pores are about 125 million [[atomic mass unit|daltons]] in [[molecular weight]] and consist of around 50 (in [[yeast]]) to 100 proteins (in [[vertebrate]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lodish&quot; /&gt; The pores are 100&amp; nbsp;nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9&amp;nbsp;nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size allows the free passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as [[nucleic acid]]s and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhoades&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 1996| title = Human Physiology | editor = Rodney Rhoades, Richard Pflanzer | publisher = Saunders College Publishing | chapter = Ch3 | edition = 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; each of which contains a donut-shaped, eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shulga&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | author = Shulga N, Mosammaparast N, Wozniak R, Goldfarb D | title = Yeast nucleoporins involved in passive nuclear envelope permeability | journal = J Cell Biol | volume = 149 | issue = 5 | pages = 1027–1038 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10831607 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.149.5.1027  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to the ring is a structure called the ''nuclear basket'' that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lodish&quot; /&gt;

Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some RNAs are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as [[karyopherin]]s. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pemberton&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | author = Pemberton L, Paschal B | title = Mechanisms of receptor-mediated nuclear import and nuclear export | journal = Traffic | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 187–198 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15702987 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0854.2005.00270.x  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steroid hormone]]s such as [[cortisol]] and [[aldosterone]], as well as other small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular [[cell signaling|signaling]], can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind [[nuclear receptor]] proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as [[transcription factor]]s when bound to their [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]; in the absence of ligand, many such receptors function as [[histone deacetylase]]s that repress gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lodish&quot;/&gt;

===Nuclear lamina===
{{main|Nuclear lamina}}
In animal cells, two networks of [[intermediate filaments]] provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The [[nuclear lamina]] forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores.&lt;ref name=&quot;MBoC&quot; /&gt;

The nuclear lamina is composed mostly of [[lamin]] proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported into the nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sturrman&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | author = Stuurman N, Heins S, Aebi U | title = Nuclear lamins: their structure, assembly, and interactions | journal = J Struct Biol | volume = 122 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 42–66 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9724605 | doi = 10.1006/jsbi.1998.3987  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldman&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | author = Goldman A, Moir R, Montag-Lowy M, Stewart M, Goldman R | title = Pathway of incorporation of microinjected lamin A into the nuclear envelope | journal = J Cell Biol | volume = 119 | issue = 4 | pages = 725–735 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1429833 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.119.4.725  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the ''nucleoplasmic veil'',&lt;ref name=&quot;RGoldman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goldman R, Gruenbaum Y, Moir R, Shumaker D, Spann T | title = Nuclear lamins: building blocks of nuclear architecture  | doi = 10.1101/gad.960502| url=http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/full/16/5/533 | journal = Genes Dev | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 533–547 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11877373}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is visible using [[fluorescence microscopy]]. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the [[nucleolus]] and is present during [[interphase]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Moir&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal | author = Moir RD, Yoona M, Khuona S, Goldman RD. | title = Nuclear Lamins A and B1: Different Pathways of Assembly during Nuclear Envelope Formation in Living Cells | journal = Journal of Cell Biology | year = 2000 | volume = 151 | issue = 6 | pages =  1155–1168 | pmid = 11121432 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.151.6.1155  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lamin structures that make up the veil bind [[chromatin]] and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spann&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | authors = Spann TP, Goldman AE, Wang C, Huang S, Goldman RD. | journal = Journal of Cell Biology | title = Alteration of nuclear lamin organization inhibits RNA polymerase II–dependent transcription | year = 2002 | volume = 156 | issue = 4 | pages = 603–608 | pmid = 11854306 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.200112047  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the components of other [[intermediate filament]]s, the lamin [[monomer]] contains an [[alpha-helix|alpha-helical]] domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a [[protein dimer|dimer]] structure called a [[coiled coil]]. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]] arrangement, to form a [[tetramer protein|tetramer]] called a ''protofilament''. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike ''filament''. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.&lt;ref name=&quot;MBoC&quot; /&gt;

Mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly are known as ''[[laminopathies]]''. The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as [[progeria]], which causes the appearance of premature [[aging]] in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged [[phenotype]] is not well understood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mounkes&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal |author=Mounkes LC, Stewart CL| title = Aging and nuclear organization: lamins and progeria | journal = Current Opinion in Cell Biology | year = 2004 | volume = 16 | pages = 322–327 | pmid = 15145358 | doi = 10.1016/j.ceb.2004.03.009 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chromosomes===
{{main|Chromosome}}

[[Image:MouseChromosomeTerritoriesBMC Cell Biol6-44Fig2e.jpg|thumb|200px|A mouse [[fibroblast]] nucleus in which [[DNA]] is stained blue. The distinct chromosome territories of chromosome 2 (red) and chromosome 9 (green) are visible stained with [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]].]]

The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear [[DNA]] molecules organized into structures called [[chromosome]]s. Each human cell contains 2m of DNA. During most of the [[cell cycle]] these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as [[chromatin]], and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined [[chromosome]]s familiar from a [[karyotype]]. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the [[mitochondria]].

===Nucleolus===
{{main|Nucleolus}}

[[Image:Micrograph of a cell nucleus.png|thumb|left|200px|An [[electron micrograph]] of a cell nucleus, showing the darkly stained [[nucleolus]].]]

The [[nucleolus]] is a discrete densely stained structure found in the nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a ''suborganelle''. It forms around [[tandem]] repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA). These regions are called [[nucleolar organizer regions]] (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hernandez-Verdun&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

  | pmid = 16328431  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step in ribosomal assembly is transcription of the rDNA, by a protein called [[RNA polymerase I]], forming a large pre-rRNA precursor. This is cleaved into the subunits 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamond-Sleeman&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal

The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear pores.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lodish&quot; /&gt;

When observed under the [[electron microscope]], the nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost ''fibrillar centers'' (FCs), surrounded by the ''dense fibrillar component'' (DFC), which in turn is bordered by the ''granular component'' (GC). Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.&lt;ref name=Lamond-Sleeman /&gt;

Besides the nucleolus, the nucleus contains a number of other non-membrane-delineated bodies. These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, [[paraspeckle]]s, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dundr&quot; /&gt;

Other subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods has been reported in some cases of [[nemaline myopathy]]. This condition typically results from mutations in [[actin]], and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goebel&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | last =Goebel| first =H.H. | coauthors =I Warlow| month=January | year =1997 | title =Nemaline myopathy with intranuclear rods—intranuclear rod myopathy| journal =Neuromuscular Disorders | volume =7 | issue =1 | pages =13–19 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-8966(96)00404-X| pmid =9132135 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cajal bodies and gems====
A nucleus typically contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called [[Cajal body|Cajal bodies]] or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2&amp;nbsp;µm and 2.0&amp;nbsp;µm depending on the cell type and species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cioce&quot; /&gt; When seen under an [[electron microscope]], they resemble balls of tangled thread&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot; /&gt; and are dense foci of distribution for the protein [[coilin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MateraFrey&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | author = Matera AG, Frey MA. | title = Coiled Bodies and Gems: Janus or Gemini? | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 317–321 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9683623  | doi = 10.1086/301992  }}&lt;/ref&gt; CBs are involved in a number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically [[snoRNA|small nucleolar RNA]] (snoRNA) and [[small nuclear RNA]] (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cioce&quot; /&gt;

Similar to Cajal bodies are Gemini of coiled bodies, or gems, whose name is derived from the [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini constellation]] in reference to their close &quot;twin&quot; relationship with CBs. Gems are similar in size and shape to CBs, and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope.&lt;ref name=&quot;MateraFrey&quot; /&gt; Unlike CBs, gems do not contain [[snRNP|small nuclear ribonucleoproteins]] (snRNPs), but do contain a protein called ''survivor of motor [[neurons]]'' (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis,&lt;ref name=&quot;Matera&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal

====RAFA and PTF domains====
RAFA domains, or polymorphic interphase karyosomal associations, were first described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function was and remains unclear, though they were not thought to be associated with active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saunders&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | author = Saunders WS, Cooke CA, Earnshaw WC | title = Compartmentalization within the nucleus: discovery of a novel subnuclear region. | journal = Journal of Cellular Biology | volume = 115 | issue = 4 | pages = 919–931 | year = 1991  | doi = 10.1083/jcb.115.4.919  }} PMID 1955462&lt;/ref&gt; They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the [[transcription factor]] PTF, which promotes transcription of [[snRNA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pombo&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | author = Pombo A, Cuello P, Schul W, Yoon J, Roeder R, Cook P, Murphy S | title = Regional and temporal specialization in the nucleus: a transcriptionally active nuclear domain rich in PTF, Oct1 and PIKA antigens associates with specific chromosomes early in the cell cycle | journal = EMBO J | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 1768–1778 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9501098 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/17.6.1768  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====PML bodies====
Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found scattered throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.2–1.0&amp;nbsp;µm. They are known by a number of other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. It has been suggested that they play a role in regulating transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dundr&quot; /&gt;

Paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity. They are transcription dependent&lt;ref name=&quot;para1&quot;/&gt; and in the absence of RNA Pol II transcription, the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated protein components  (PSP1, p54nrb, PSP2, CFI(m)68, and PSF) form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the [[nucleolus]]. This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle. In the [[cell cycle]], paraspeckles are present during [[interphase]] and during all of [[mitosis]] except for [[telophase]]. During telophase, when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no [[RNA]] Pol II [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap.&lt;ref name=&quot;para3&quot;/&gt;

====Splicing speckles====
Speckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and are located in the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells. At the fluorescence-microscope level they appear as irregular, punctate structures, which vary in size and shape, and when examined by electron microscopy they are seen as clusters of interchromatin granules. Speckles are dynamic structures, and both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations, including active transcription sites. Studies on the composition, structure and behaviour of speckles have provided a model for understanding the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus and the organization of the gene-expression machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lamond AI, Spector DL |title=Nuclear speckles: a model for nuclear organelles |journal=Nat.

==Function==
The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the [[cell cycle]]. The nucleus provides a site for genetic [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] that is segregated from the location of [[translation (genetics)|translation]] in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of [[gene regulation]] that are not available to [[prokaryote]]s.

===Cell compartmentalization===
The nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In some cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of [[glycolysis]], a cellular pathway for breaking down [[glucose]] to produce energy. [[Hexokinase]] is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming [[glucose-6-phosphate]] from glucose. At high concentrations of [[fructose-6-phosphate]], a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehninger&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Lehninger | first =Albert L. | coauthors =David L. Nelson, Michael M. Cox. | title =Lehninger principles of biochemistry | edition =3rd | year =2000 | publisher =Worth Publishers | location =New York | isbn = 1-57259-931-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moreno&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal | author=Moreno F, Ahuatzi D, Riera A, Palomino CA, Herrero P. |year=2005 |title = Glucose sensing through the Hxk2-dependent signalling pathway. |journal=Biochem Soc Trans | volume =  33 | issue = 1 |pages = 265–268 | pmid = 15667322  | doi = 10.1042/BST0330265  }} PMID 15667322&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some [[transcription factor]] proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of [[NF-κB]]-controlled genes, which are involved in most [[inflammation|inflammatory]] responses, transcription is induced in response to a [[cell signaling|signal pathway]] such as that initiated by the signaling molecule [[TNF-α]], binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A [[nuclear localisation signal]] on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;MBoC&quot; /&gt;

The compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorlich&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | last = Görlich | first = Dirk | coauthors = Ulrike Kutay | title = Transport between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm | journal = Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. | volume =15 | issue = 1 | pages = 607–660 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10611974  | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.15.1.607  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eukaryotic mRNA contains [[introns]] that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in misformed and nonfunctional proteins.

===Gene expression===
{{main|Gene expression}}

[[File:Transcription label en.jpg||thumb|200px|left|A micrograph of ongoing [[gene transcription]] of [[ribosomal RNA]] illustrating the growing [[primary transcript]]s. &quot;Begin&quot; indicates the [[3' end]] of the DNA, where new RNA synthesis begins; &quot;end&quot; indicates the [[5' end]], where the primary transcripts are almost complete.]]

Gene expression first involves [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], in which DNA is used as a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), which then needs to be [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by [[ribosomes]] to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Protein Synthesis and Ribosome Structure: Translating the Genome |last=Nierhaus |first=Knud H. |coauthors=Daniel N. Wilson |year=2004 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |isbn=3-527-30638-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the nucleus is the site of transcription, it also contains a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include [[helicase]]s, which unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, [[RNA polymerase]]s, which synthesize the growing RNA molecule, [[topoisomerase]]s, which change the amount of [[supercoil]]ing in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of [[transcription factor]]s that regulate expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genome Structure and Function: From Chromosomes Characterization to Genes Technology |last=Nicolini |first=Claudio A. |year=1997 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-7923-4565-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Processing of pre-mRNA===
{{main|Post-transcriptional modification}}
Newly synthesized mRNA molecules are known as [[primary transcript]]s or pre-mRNA. They must undergo [[post-transcriptional modification]] in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein [[translation (genetics)|translation]]. The three main modifications are [[5' cap]]ping, 3' [[polyadenylation]], and [[RNA splicing]]. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as [[heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle]]s (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-[[adenine]] tail is only added after transcription is complete.

RNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the [[spliceosome]], is the process by which [[introns]], or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining [[exon]]s connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lodish&quot; /&gt; Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding [[antibody|antibodies]], can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different [[primary structure|protein sequences]]. This process is known as [[alternative splicing]], and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.

==Dynamics and regulation==
===Nuclear transport===
{{main|Nuclear transport}}

[[Image:RanGTPcycle.png|360px|Right|thumb|[[Macromolecule]]s, such as [[RNA]] and [[protein]]s, are [[active transport|actively transported]] across the nuclear membrane in a process called the [[Ran (biology)|Ran]]-[[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] nuclear transport cycle.]]

The entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes. Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Watson | first = JD | coauthors = Baker TA, Bell SP, Gann A, Levine M, Losick R. | title = Molecular Biology of the Gene | publisher = Peason Benjamin Cummings; CSHL Press. | year = 2004 | edition = 5th | chapter = Ch9–10 | isbn = 0-8053-9603-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association [[karyopherin]]s called [[importin]]s to enter the nucleus and [[exportin]]s to exit. &quot;Cargo&quot; proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as [[nuclear localization signal]]s, which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry [[nuclear export signal]]s bound by exportins. The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by [[GTPase]]s, enzymes that [[hydrolyze]] the molecule [[guanosine triphosphate]] to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is [[Ran (biology)|Ran]], which can bind either GTP or GDP (guanosine diphosphate), depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pemberton&quot; /&gt;

Nuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.

Specialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to the these molecules' central role in protein translation; mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lodish&quot; /&gt;

===Assembly and disassembly===
[[Image:Mitosis-flourescent.jpg|thumb|left|230px|An image of a [[newt]] [[lung]] cell [[staining (biology)|stained]] with [[fluorescent]] [[dye]]s during [[metaphase]]. The [[mitotic spindle]] can be seen, stained green, attached to the two sets of [[chromosome]]s, stained light blue. All chromosomes but one are already at the metaphase plate. ]]

During its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down, either in the process of [[cell division]] or as a consequence of [[apoptosis]], a regulated form of cell death. During these events, the structural components of the nucleus—the envelope and lamina—are systematically degraded.

During the [[cell cycle]] the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the [[sister chromatid]]s, attaching to [[microtubule]]s, which in turn are attached to different [[centrosome]]s. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lippincott-Schwartz&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal
   | last = Lippincott-Schwartz  | first = Jennifer | title = Cell biology: Ripping up the nuclear envelope | journal = Nature | volume = 416 | issue = 6876 | pages = 31–32 | date = 2002-03-07 | doi =10.1038/416031a  | pmid = 11882878  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in [[prophase]] and until around [[prometaphase]], the nuclear membrane is dismantled.&lt;ref name=&quot;RGoldman&quot; /&gt; Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boulikas&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Boulikas T | title = Phosphorylation of transcription factors and control of the cell cycle | journal = Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–77 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7549180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boulikas&quot; /&gt;

However, in [[dinoflagellates]], the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., [[ciliate]]s, [[Apicomplexa|sporozoans]]) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemle during cell division.

[[Apoptosis]] is a controlled process in which the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic [[protease]]s called [[caspase]]s, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in [[assay]]s for early apoptotic activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;RGoldman&quot; /&gt; Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus.&lt;ref name=&quot;RGoldman&quot; /&gt; Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steen&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | author = Steen R, Collas P | title = Mistargeting of B-type lamins at the end of mitosis: implications on cell survival and regulation of lamins A/C expression | journal = J Cell Biol | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 621–626 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11331311 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.153.3.621  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as [[herpesvirus]] replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.&lt;ref name=&quot;RGoldman&quot; /&gt;

==Anucleated and polynucleated cells==
[[Image:redbloodcells.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Human red blood cells, like those of other mammals, lack nuclei. This occurs as a normal part of the cells' development.]]

Although most cells have a single nucleus, some eukaryotic cell types have no nucleus, and others have many nuclei. This can be a normal process, as in the maturation of mammalian [[red blood cell]]s, or a result of faulty cell division.

Anucleated cells contain no nucleus and are, therefore, incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells. The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or erythrocyte, which also lacks other organelles such as [[mitochondria]], and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry [[oxygen]] from the [[lungs]] to the body's tissues. Erythrocytes mature through [[erythropoiesis]] in the [[bone marrow]], where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes. The nucleus is expelled during the process of differentiation from an [[erythroblast]] to a [[reticulocyte]], which is the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skutelsky&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | last =Skutelsky | first =E. | coauthors =Danon D. | month =June | year =1970 | title =Comparative study of nuclear expulsion from the late erythroblast and cytokinesis | journal =J Cell Biol | issue =60(3) | pages =625–635 | pmid =5422968 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of [[mutagen]]s may induce the release of some immature &quot;micronucleated&quot; erythrocytes into the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=&quot;Torous&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | last =Torous | first =DK | coauthors =Dertinger SD, Hall NE, Tometsko CR. | date = | year =2000 | title =Enumeration of micronucleated reticulocytes in rat peripheral blood: a flow cytometric study | journal =Mutat Res | volume = | issue =465(1–2) | pages =91–99 | doi = | pmid =10708974 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hutter&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | last =Hutter  | first =KJ | coauthors =Stohr M. | year =1982 | title =Rapid detection of mutagen induced micronucleated erythrocytes by flow cytometry | journal =Histochemistry | volume =75 |issue=3 | pages =353–362 | pmid =7141888 | url =  | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other has two nuclei.

==Evolution==
As the major defining characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus' [[evolution]]ary origin has been the subject of much speculation. Four major theories have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pennisi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pennisi E.| title = Evolutionary biology. The birth of the nucleus | doi = 10.1126/science.305.5685.766| journal = Science | volume = 305 | issue =5685 | pages = 766–768 | year =2004 | pmid = 15297641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory known as the &quot;syntrophic model&quot; proposes that a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship between the [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]] created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell. (Organisms of the Archaea domain have no cell nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Archaea?topic=49496 ''Archaea''. eds. E.Monosson &amp; C.Cleveland, Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC.]&lt;/ref&gt;) It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern [[Methanogenesis|methanogenic]] archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern [[myxobacteria]], eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Margulis&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author= Margulis, Lynn | year= 1981 | title= Symbiosis in Cell Evolution | pages=206–227 | publisher= W. H. Freeman and Company | location=San Francisco | isbn = 0-7167-1256-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins, including [[histone]]s. Observations that myxobacteria are motile, can form multicellular complexes, and possess [[kinase]]s and [[G protein]]s similar to eukarya, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopez-Garcia&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lopez-Garcia P, Moreira D. | title = Selective forces for the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus | doi = 10.1002/bies.20413| journal = Bioessays | volume = 28 | issue =5 | pages = 525–533 | year =2006 | pmid = 16615090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second model proposes that proto-eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage. This model is based on the existence of modern [[planctomycetes]] bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuerst&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | author =Fuerst JA. | title = Intracellular compartmentation in planctomycetes | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol. | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 299–328 | year =2005 | pmid = 15910279 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.59.030804.121258  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar proposal states that a eukaryote-like cell, the [[chronocyte]], evolved first and [[phagocytosed]] archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author =Hartman H, Fedorov A. | title = The origin of the eukaryotic cell: a genomic investigation  | doi = 10.1073/pnas.032658599| journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. | volume = 99 | issue =3 | pages = 1420–1425 | year =2002 | pmid = 11805300 | pmc =122206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most controversial model, known as ''[[viral eukaryogenesis]]'', posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, along with other eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins (analogizing [[histone]]s to [[viral envelope]]s). One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with [[phagocytosis]] to form an early cellular &quot;[[predator]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bell PJ |title=Viral eukaryogenesis: was the ancestor of the nucleus a complex DNA virus? |journal=J.

A very recent proposal suggests that traditional variants of the endosymbiont theory are insufficiently powerful to explain the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus. This model, termed the ''exomembrane hypothesis'', suggests that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as [[ribosome|ribosomal]] subunits.&lt;ref name=&quot;deRoos&quot;&gt;{{cite  journal  | author = de Roos AD| title = The origin of the eukaryotic cell based on conservation of existing interfaces| journal = Artif Life | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 513–523. | year =2006 | pmid = 16953783 | doi = 10.1162/artl.2006.12.4.513  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;chardonnay socialist&quot; is regularly used by people from throughout the  political spectrum to criticise opponents. For example, Australian left-wing &quot;true believers&quot; levelled it at supporters of the failed [[Australian republic referendum, 1999|republic referendum of 1999]] (where the vote was split not along conventional party lines but very much along socio-economic divides, with the rich overwhelmingly supporting the change while the less well-off were opposed &amp;ndash; a superficially bizarre pattern for a non-economic issue). Staunch Australian [[right-wing]]ers, on the other hand, level it at those who support such things as government funding for the [[art]]s, free tertiary education, and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] &amp;ndash; all causes which are described by critics as &quot;middle-class [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]]&quot;.

The [[ad hominem]] argument was particularly used by the [[Howard Government]] against members of the [[Australian Labor Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://arts.monash.edu.au/psi/news-and-events/apsa/refereed-papers/au-nz-politics/rolfe.pdf|format=PDF|title = Days of Wine and Poseurs: Stereotpypes of Class, Consumption &amp; Competition in Democratic Discourse |work = A Paper Delivered to the Australasian Political Studies Association Annual Conference 24th-26th September 2007, Monash University | publisher = Monash University|last = Rolfe| first = Mark| year = 2007| accessdate = 2008-09-11|quote = (from pages 24-5) From his first day in parliament as leader in March 1995 until the election, Howard courted the strong public perceptions of Keating arrogance that were evident in party polling. This was the context to the ad hominem of ‘chardonnay socialist’ that was extended to any Labor speaker and to the whole ALP in an attempt to undermine their ethos through associations with self-indulgence, selfishness and lack of concern for the people. Frequent deployment of these terms by the media provided a further convincing context for this rhetoric. Kim Carr was called a ‘Bollinger Bolshevik’ by Vanstone (Commonwealth Parliamentary Debates [CPD], Senate, 13 May 1997) and there was ‘Chardonnay Cheryl’ Kernot, the ‘shadow minister for the selfish “me generation” yuppies’ with her ‘list of hors d’oeuvres for the next caucus radical chic soiree’, said Richard Alston (CPD, Senate, 4 March 1998; 23 March 1998; 30 March 1998). She could be seen with Mark Latham, said David Kemp, ‘on the patio sipping their wine, complaining about the excesses of capitalism’ (CPD, Senate, 22 October 1997).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The older term for this or a similar kind of person was &quot;salon communist.&quot;

Other similar terms are the &quot;[[chattering classes]]&quot; (coined in England in the 1980s) and &quot;[[latte]] liberal&quot;.&lt;ref name = Byrnes&gt;{{cite journal |last= Byrnes|first=  Andrew|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |month= |title= Law, Lawyers and Lattes: The (Ir)relevance of the Chattering Classes in a Time of Insecurity: Law Week Lecture 29 March 2006|journal= University of New South Wales Faculty of Law Research Series|volume= 2007|issue=6 |pages= |id= |url= http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLRS/2007/6.html|accessdate=2008-09-11 |quote= The political origins and the use of terms such as the ‘chattering classes’ -- and its close friends ‘chardonnay socialist’ and ‘latte liberal’ – have been carefully analysed by Australian and overseas scholars of political science.

In addition, several figures, known as [[Saint Nicholas]], [[Father Christmas]], and [[Santa Claus]], among other names, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16329025 &quot;Poll: In a changing nation, Santa endures&quot;], Associated Press, December 22, 2006.

Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity among both Christians and non-Christians, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. The economic impact of Christmas is a factor that has grown steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.

==Etymology==
The word ''Christmas'' originated as a compound meaning &quot;[[Christ]]'s [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]&quot;. It is derived from the [[Middle English]] ''Christemasse'' and [[Old English language|Old English]] ''Cristes mæsse,'' a phrase first recorded in 1038.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot; /&gt; &quot;Cristes&quot; is from Greek ''Christos'' and &quot;mæsse&quot; is from Latin ''missa'' (the holy [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]).

==Celebration==
{{See|Christmas worldwide}}

Christmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and [[public]] holiday in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-Christian. In some non-Christian countries, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. [[Hong Kong]]); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday. Countries such as Japan and Korea, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the secular aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations and Christmas trees. Notable countries in which Christmas is not a formal public holiday include [[People's Republic of China]], (excepting [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macao]]), [[Japan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Algeria]], [[Thailand]], [[Nepal]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]] and [[North Korea]]. Christmas celebrations around the world can vary markedly in form, reflecting differing cultural and national traditions.

Among countries with a strong Christian tradition, a variety of Christmas celebrations have developed that incorporate regional and local cultures. For Christians, participating in a religious service plays an important part in the recognition of the season. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance. In [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] countries, the people hold religious processions or [[parade]]s in the days preceding Christmas. In other countries, secular processions or parades featuring Santa Claus and other seasonal figures are often held. Family reunions and the exchange of gifts are a widespread feature of the season. Gift giving takes place on Christmas Day in most countries. Others practice gift giving on December 6, Saint Nicholas Day, and January 6, [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].

===Date of celebration===
For centuries, [[Christian]] writers accepted that Christmas was the actual date on which [[Jesus]] was born.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Pope [[Benedict XIV]] argued in 1761 that the church fathers would have known the correct date of birth from Roman census records. (Roll, Susan K., ''Toward the Origins of Christmas'', (Peeters Publishers, 1995), p. 129.)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 18th century, scholars began proposing alternative explanations. [[Isaac Newton]] argued that the date of Christmas was selected to correspond with the [[winter solstice]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton&quot;/&gt; which the Romans called ''bruma'' and celebrated on December 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;SolsticeDate&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/SF/WinSol.html Bruma]&quot;, ''Seasonal Festivals of the Greeks and Romans''&lt;br /&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137&amp;query=head%3D%231117 18:59]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1743, German Protestant Paul Ernst Jablonski argued Christmas was placed on December 25 to correspond with the Roman solar holiday ''[[Dies Natalis Solis Invicti]]'' and was therefore a &quot;paganization&quot; that debased the true church.&lt;ref name=&quot;SolInvictus&quot;/&gt; In 1889, [[Louis Duchesne]] suggested that the date of Christmas was calculated as nine months after Annunciation, the traditional date of the conception of Jesus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roll87&quot;&gt;Roll, pp. 88–90.&lt;br /&gt;Duchesne, Louis, ''Les Origines du Culte Chrétien,'' Paris, 1902, 262 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The December 25 date may have been selected by the church in Rome in the early 4th century. At this time, a church calendar was created and other holidays were also placed on solar dates: &quot;It is cosmic symbolism...which inspired the Church leadership in Rome to elect the winter solstice, December 25, as the birthday of Christ, and the summer solstice as that of John the Baptist, supplemented by the equinoxes as their respective dates of conception. While they were aware that pagans called this day the 'birthday' of Sol Invictus, this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for Christmas,&quot; according to modern scholar S.E. Hijmans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hijmans&quot;&gt;S.E. Hijmans, ''Sol, the sun in the art and religions of Rome,'' 2009, pp. 587–588.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, today, whether or not the birth date of Jesus is on December 25 is not considered to be an important issue in mainstream [[Christian denominations]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Joan Chittister, Phyllis Tickle&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=inhMGc5732kC&amp;pg=PT40&amp;dq=date+of+christmas+important#v=onepage&amp;q=date%20of%20christmas%20important&amp;f=false| title = The Liturgical Year|publisher = [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]]|quote=Christmas is not really about the celebration of a birth date at all. It is about the celebration of a birth. The fact of the date and the fact of the birth are two different things. The calendrical verification of the feast itself is not really that important...What is important to the understanding of a life-changing moment is that it happened, not necessarily where of when it happened. The message is clear: Christmas is not about marking the actual birth date of Jesus. It is about the Incarnation of the One who became like us in all things but sin (Heb. 4:15) and who humbled Himself &quot;to the point of death-even death on a cross&quot; (Phil. 2:8). Christmas is a pinnacle feast, yes, but it is not the beginning of the liturgical year. It is a memorial, a remembrance, of the birth of Jesus, not really a celebration of the day itself. We remember that because the Jesus of history was born, the Resurrection of the Christ of faith could happen. |accessdate = 2009-04-02|isbn = 9780849901195|date = 2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Voice-Christmas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.crivoice.org/cyxmas.html| title = The Christmas Season|publisher = CRI / Voice, Institute|accessdate = 2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard University&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=x_kBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA469&amp;dq=date+of+christmas+unimportant#v=onepage&amp;q=date%20of%20christmas%20unimportant&amp;f=false| title = The School Journal, Volume 49|publisher = [[Harvard University]]|quote=Throughout the Christian world the 25th of December is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus Christ.

The choice of that day was, of course, wholly arbitrary, for neither the exact date not the period of the year at which the birth of Christ occurred is known. For purposes of commemoration, however, it is unimportant whether the celebration shall fall or not a the precise anniversary of the joyous event.|accessdate = 2009-04-02|year = 1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather, celebrating the coming of [[Holy Trinity|God]] into the world in the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|form of man]] to [[Atonement in Christianity|atone]] for the [[sin]]s of humanity is considered to be the primary meaning of Christmas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joan Chittister, Phyllis Tickle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Voice-Christmas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard University&quot;/&gt;

====Orthodox Christian Churches====
{{About||details on religious observances|Christmas Eve}}

[[Eastern Orthodox]] national churches, including those of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgia]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church|Ukraine]], [[Macedonian Orthodox Church|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbia]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Greek Patriarchate of Jerusalem]] mark feasts using the older [[Julian Calendar]]. December 25 on that calendar currently corresponds to January 7 on the more widely used [[Gregorian calendar]].  However, other Orthodox Christians, such as the churches of [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greece]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romania]], [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Antioch]], [[Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania|Albania]], [[Orthodox Church of Finland|Finland]] and the [[Orthodox Church in America]], among others, began using the [[Revised Julian Calendar]] in the early 20th century, which corresponds exactly to the Gregorian Calendar.  These Orthodox Churches celebrate Christmas on the same day as [[Western Christianity]].  [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches also use their own calendars, which are generally similar to the Julian calendar. The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] celebrates the nativity in combination with the [[Feast of the Epiphany]] on January 6. Armenian churches customarily use the Gregorian calendar, but some use the Julian calendar and thus celebrate Christmas Day on January 19, and Christmas Eve on January 18 (according to the Gregorian calendar).&lt;ref name=4Dates&gt;

According to these accounts, Jesus was born to Mary, assisted by her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], in the city of [[Bethlehem]].

According to popular tradition, the birth took place in a stable, surrounded by farm animals, though neither the stable nor the animals are specifically mentioned in the Biblical accounts. However, a [[manger]] is mentioned in {{Bibleverse||Luke|2:7|KJV}}, where it states, &quot;She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.&quot; Early [[icon]]ographic representations of the nativity placed the animals and manger within a cave (located, according to tradition, under the [[Church of the Nativity]] in Bethlehem). [[Adoration of the Shepherds|Shepherds from the fields]] surrounding Bethlehem were told of the birth by an [[angel]], and were the first to see the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202:1-16;&amp;version=9; |title=Luke 2:1–6 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel of Matthew also describes a visit by several [[Biblical magi|Magi]], or astrologers, who bring gifts of [[gold]], [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]] to the infant Jesus. The visitors were said to be following a mysterious star, commonly known as the [[Star of Bethlehem]], believing it to announce the birth of a king of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Matthew|2:2|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The commemoration of this visit, the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of Epiphany]] celebrated on January 6, is the formal end of the Christmas season in some churches.

Christians celebrate Christmas in various ways. In addition to this day being one of the most important and popular for the attendance of church services, there are other devotions and popular traditions. In some [[Christian denominations]], children re-enact the events of the Nativity with animals to portray the event with more realism or  sing [[carols]] that reference the event.  Some Christians also display a small re-creation of the Nativity, known as a [[Nativity scene]] or crèche, in their homes, using figurines to portray the key characters of the event. Prior to Christmas Day, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] practices the 40-day [[Nativity Fast]] in anticipation of the birth of Jesus, while much of [[Western Christianity]] celebrates four weeks of [[Advent]]. The final preparations for Christmas are made on [[Christmas Eve]].

A long artistic tradition has grown of producing painted depictions of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity in art]]. Nativity scenes are traditionally set in a barn or stable and include Mary, Joseph, the child Jesus, angels, shepherds and [[Biblical Magi|the Three Wise Men]]: Balthazar, Melchior, and Caspar, who are said to have followed a star, known as the [[Star of Bethlehem]], and arrived after his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%202:1-11;&amp;version=9; |title=Matthew 2:1–11 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of putting up special decorations at Christmas has a long history. From pre-Christian times, people in the Roman Empire brought branches from evergreen plants indoors in the winter. Decorating with greenery was also part of Jewish tradition :
&quot;Now on the first day you shall take for yourselves the foliage of beautiful trees, palm branches and boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days. &quot; (Leviticus 23:40)

Christians incorporated such customs in their developing practices. In the 15th century, it was recorded that in London it was the custom at Christmas for every house and all the parish churches to be &quot;decked with [[Quercus ilex|holm]], ivy, [[bay leaves|bays]], and whatsoever the season of the year afforded to be green&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Clement A, ''Christmas customs and traditions'', Courier Dover Publications, 1976, ISBN 0-486-23354-5, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The heart-shaped leaves of [[ivy]] were said to symbolize the coming to earth of Jesus, while [[holly]] was seen as protection against pagans and witches, its thorns and red berries held to represent the [[Crown of Thorns]] worn by Jesus at the crucifixion and the blood he shed.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Ruth, ''Christmas: Its Carols, Customs &amp; Legends'', Alfred Publishing (1985), ISBN 0-7692-4399-1, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ace Collins&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=mo8vgZoROl8C&amp;pg=PT71&amp;dq=christmas+colors#v=onepage&amp;q=christmas%20colors&amp;f=false|title=Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas|author=Ace Collins|publisher=[[Zondervan]]|accessdate=2010-12-02|isbn = 9780310873884|date = 2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nativity scenes are known from 10th-century Rome. They were popularised by Saint [[Francis of Asissi]] from 1223, quickly spreading across Europe.&lt;ref name=Collins47&gt;Collins, Ace, ''Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas'', Zondervan, (2003), ISBN 0-310-24880-9 p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of decorations developed across the Christian world, dependent on local tradition and available resources. The first commercially produced decorations appeared in Germany in the 1860s, inspired by paper chains made by children.&lt;ref name=Collins83&gt;Collins p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In countries where a representation of the [[Nativity Scene]] is very popular, people are encouraged to compete and create the most original or realistic ones. Within some families, the pieces used to make the representation are considered a valuable family [[heirloom]].  

The traditional colors of Christmas are [[green]] and [[red]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Christmasmagic&quot;&gt;Hal Siemer, [http://www.questmagazine.com/christmas.html Christmas Magic: The History and Traditions of the Holiday], ''QuestMagazine.com'', 2004-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt; [[White (color)|White]], [[silver (color)|silver]] and [[gold (color)|gold]] are also popular.  Red symbolizes the blood of Jesus, which was shed in his crucifixion, while green symbolizes eternal life, and in particular the evergreen tree, which does not lose its leaves in the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ace Collins&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christmasmagic&quot;/&gt;

The [[Christmas tree]] is considered by some as Christianisation of [[pagan]] tradition and ritual surrounding the [[Winter Solstice]], which included the use of [[evergreen]] boughs, and an adaptation of pagan [[tree worship]].&lt;ref name=Shaman/&gt; [[English language|The English language]] phrase &quot;Christmas tree&quot; is first recorded in 1835&lt;ref name=Harper&gt;Harper, Douglas, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Christ Christ], ''Online Etymology Dictionary,'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and represents an importation from the [[German language]].

St. Paul: [[Llewellyn Worldwide|Llewellyn Publications]], 1995.

By 1841 the Christmas tree had become even more widespread throughout Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lejeune, Marie Claire p.550&quot;&gt;Lejeune, Marie Claire. ''Compendium of symbolic and ritual plants in Europe'', p.550. University of Michigan ISBN 90-77135-04-9&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, people in the United States had adopted the custom of putting up a Christmas tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoemaker&quot;&gt;Shoemaker, Alfred Lewis.

[[File:Saint Anselm College SNOW.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Saint Anselm College]] decorates with traditional candles in each window and a large Christmas wreath]]
Since the 19th century, the [[poinsettia]], a native plant from [[Mexico]], has been associated with Christmas. Other popular holiday plants include holly, [[mistletoe]], red [[amaryllis]], and [[Christmas cactus]]. Along with a Christmas tree, the interior of a home may be decorated with these plants, along with [[Garland (decoration)|garlands]] and [[evergreen]] foliage.  The display of [[Christmas village]]s has also become a tradition in many homes during this season. The outside of houses may be decorated with lights and sometimes with illuminated [[Sled|sleighs]], [[snowmen]], and other Christmas figures. Other traditional decorations include [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[candles]], [[candy canes]], [[Christmas stocking|stockings]], [[wreaths]], and [[angels]]. Both the displaying of [[wreath]]s and candles in each window are a more traditional Christmas display. The concentric assortment of leaves, usually from an [[evergreen]], make up Christmas [[wreath]]s and are designed to prepare [[Christians]] for the Advent season. Candles in each window are meant to demonstrate the fact that Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the ultimate light of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=1173&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these antiquated, more subdued, Christmas displays are seen in the image to the right of [[Saint Anselm College]]. 

Christmas lights and banners may be hung along streets, music played from speakers, and Christmas trees placed in prominent places.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Brian. [http://www.historymatters.appstate.edu/documents/christmaslights.pdf &quot;Christmas lights and community building in America,&quot;] ''History Matters'', Spring 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is common in many parts of the world for town squares and consumer shopping areas to sponsor and display decorations. Rolls of brightly colored paper with secular or religious Christmas motifs are manufactured for the purpose of wrapping gifts.  

In some countries, Christmas decorations are traditionally taken down on [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], the evening of January 5.

===Music and carols===
{{Main|Christmas music}}
[[File:Chant'tie d'Cantiques dé Noué Dézembre 2009 Jèrri a.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Christmas carolers in [[Jersey]]]]

The first specifically Christmas hymns that we know of appear in 4th century [[Rome]]. Latin hymns such as ''Veni redemptor gentium'', written by [[Ambrose]], Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to [[Arianism]]. ''Corde natus ex Parentis'' (''Of the Father's love begotten'') by the Spanish poet [[Prudentius]] (d. 413) is still sung in some churches today.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Clement, ''Christmas customs and traditions'', Courier Dover Publications, 1976, ISBN 0-486-23354-5, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas &quot;Sequence&quot; or &quot;Prose&quot; was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] into a sequence of rhymed [[stanza]]s. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of St. Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional [[Christmas carol]].

By the 13th century, in France, Germany, and particularly, Italy, under the influence of [[Francis of Asissi]], a strong tradition of popular Christmas songs in the native language developed.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, pp. 31–37&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of [[John Audelay|John Awdlay]], a [[Shropshire]] chaplain, who lists twenty-five &quot;caroles of Cristemas&quot;, probably sung by groups of [[Wassailing|wassailers]], who went from house to house.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;
The songs we know specifically as carols were originally communal folk songs sung during celebrations such as &quot;harvest tide&quot; as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church. Traditionally, carols have often been based on [[medieval]] chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols like ''&quot;[[Personent hodie]]&quot;'', &quot;[[Good King Wenceslas]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Holly and the Ivy]]&quot; can be traced directly back to the [[Middle Ages]]. They are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. ''[[Adeste Fidelis]]'' (O Come all ye faithful) appears in its current form in the mid-18th century, although the words may have originated in the 13th century.

[[File:Steaua, Bucharest, 1842 crop.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Child singers in [[Bucharest]], 1841.]]

Singing of carols initially suffered a decline in popularity after the [[Protestant Reformation]] in northern Europe, although some Reformers, like [[Martin Luther]], wrote carols and encouraged their use in worship. Carols largely survived in rural communities until the revival of interest in popular songs in the 19th century. The 18th century English reformer [[Charles Wesley]] understood the importance of music to worship. In addition to setting many psalms to melodies, which were influential in the [[Great Awakening]] in the United States, he wrote texts for at least three Christmas carols. The best known was originally entitled &quot;Hark! How All the Welkin Rings&quot;, later renamed &quot;[[Hark! the Herald Angels Sing]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felix Mendelssohn]] wrote a melody adapted to fit Wesley's words. In Austria in 1818 Mohr and Gruber made a major addition to the genre when they composed &quot;[[Silent Night]]&quot; for the St. Nicholas Church, Oberndorf. [[William B. Sandys]]' ''Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern'' (1833) contained the first appearance in print of many now-classic English carols, and contributed to the mid-Victorian revival of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Michael Kelly. A Christmas carol p.10. Broadview Press, 2003 ISBN 1-55111-476-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Completely secular Christmas seasonal songs emerged in the late 18th century. &quot;[[Deck the Halls|Deck The Halls]]&quot; dates from 1784, and the American, &quot;[[Jingle Bells]]&quot; was copyrighted in 1857. In the 19th and 20th century, African American spirituals and songs about Christmas, based in their tradition of spirituals, became more widely known. An increasing number of seasonal holidays songs were commercially produced in the 20th century, including jazz and blues variations. In addition, there was a revival of interest in early music, from groups singing folk music, such as The Revels, to performers of early medieval and classical music.

===Food===
{{See|Christmas dinner}}
[[Image:Christmas pudding.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[Christmas pudding]]]]
A special [[Christmas dinner|Christmas family meal]] is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions, such as [[Sicily]], have special meals for Christmas Eve, when 12 kinds of fish are served. In England and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey or goose, meat, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider.  Special desserts are also prepared, such as [[Christmas pudding]], [[mince pie]]s and [[fruit cake]].&lt;ref&gt;Broomfield, Andrea (2007) [http://books.google.com/books?id=fJ_JDp9OgJEC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=christmas+pudding+england&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xzAVTc3WNoqWhQePsJW3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=christmas%20pudding%20england&amp;f=false Food and cooking in Victorian England: a history] pp.149-150.

Co., 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In Poland and other parts of eastern Europe and Scandinavia, fish often is used for the traditional main course, but richer meat such as lamb is increasingly served. In Germany, France and Austria, goose and pork are favored. Beef, ham and chicken in various recipes are popular throughout the world.  The [[Maltese people|Maltese]] traditionally serve ''[[Imbuljuta tal-Qastan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://schoolnet.gov.mt/HelloEurope/activities/recepies/imbuljuta.html Imbuljuta]&lt;/ref&gt; a chocolate and chestnuts beverage, after [[Midnight Mass]] and throughout the Christmas season. Slovaks prepare the traditional Christmas bread [[potica]], ''[[bûche de Noël]]'' in France, ''[[panettone]]'' in Italy, and elaborate tarts and cakes. The eating of sweets and chocolates has become popular worldwide, and sweeter Christmas delicacies include the German ''[[stollen]]'', [[marzipan]] cake or candy, and Jamaican rum fruit cake. As one of the few fruits traditionally available to northern countries in winter, oranges have been long associated with special Christmas foods.

===Cards===
{{Main|Christmas card}}

Christmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding Christmas Day. The traditional greeting reads &quot;wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year&quot;, much like that of the first commercial [[Christmas card#History|Christmas card]], produced by [[Sir Henry Cole]] in London in 1843. The custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging [[E-card]]s.

Christmas cards are purchased in considerable quantities, and feature artwork, commercially designed and relevant to the season.  The content of the design might relate directly to the [[Nativity of Jesus|Christmas narrative]] with [[Nativity of Jesus in art|depictions of the Nativity of Jesus]], or [[Christian symbols]] such as the [[Star of Bethlehem]], or a white [[dove]] which can represent both the [[Holy Spirit]] and [[Peace]] on Earth.  Other Christmas cards are more [[secular]] and can depict [[Christmas tradition]]s, mythical figures such as [[Santa Claus]], objects directly associated with Christmas such as candles, holly and baubles, or a variety of images associated with the season, such as Christmastime activities, snow scenes and the wildlife of the northern winter.  There are even humorous cards and genres depicting nostalgic scenes of the past such as [[crinoline]]d shoppers in idealized 19th century streetscapes.{{clr}}

Some prefer cards with a poem, prayer or [[Bible verse|Biblical verse]]; while others distance themselves from religion with an all-inclusive &quot;Season's greetings&quot;.

===Stamps===
{{Main|Christmas stamp}}
A number of nations have issued [[commemorative stamp]]s at Christmastime. Postal customers will often use these stamps to mail [[Christmas card]]s, and they are popular with [[philately|philatelists]]. These stamps are regular [[postage stamps]], unlike [[Christmas seal]]s, and are valid for postage year-round. They usually go on sale some time between early October and early December, and are printed in considerable quantities.

In 1898 a Canadian stamp was issued to mark the inauguration of the Imperial Penny Postage rate. The stamp features a map of the globe and bears an inscription &quot;XMAS 1898&quot; at the bottom. In 1937, Austria issued two &quot;Christmas greeting stamps&quot; featuring a [[rose]] and the signs of the [[zodiac]]. In 1939, [[Brazil]] issued four [[semi-postal]] stamps with designs featuring the [[three kings]] and a [[star of Bethlehem]], an [[angel]] and child, the [[Southern Cross]] and a child, and a mother and child.

Both the [[US Postal Service]] and the [[Royal Mail]] regularly issue Christmas-themed stamps each year.

===Gift giving===
{{See also|Gift economy}}
The exchanging of [[gift]]s is one of the core aspects of the modern Christmas celebration, making the Christmas season the most profitable time of year for [[retail]]ers and businesses throughout the world. Gift giving was common in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] celebration of [[Saturnalia]], an ancient festival which took place in late December and may have influenced Christmas customs.&lt;ref name=&quot;OriginMyth&quot;&gt;[http://www.bsu.edu/web/01bkswartz/xmaspub.html The Origin of American Christmas Myths and Customs] – ''Ball State University''. Swartz Jr., BK. Retrieved November 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas gift giving was banned by the [[Catholic Church]] in the [[Middle Ages]] due to its suspected [[pagan]] origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;OriginMyth&quot; /&gt; It was later rationalized by the Church on the basis that it associated [[St. Nicholas]] with Christmas, and that gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh were given to the infant Jesus by the [[Biblical Magi]].

====Legendary gift-bringing figures====
{{Main|Santa Claus|Father Christmas}}
{{See also|Saint Nicholas|Saint Basil}}
[[File:Sinterklaas 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Sinterklaas]] or [[Saint Nicholas]], considered by many to be the original Santa Claus.]]
A number of figures of both Christian and mythical origin have been associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts. Among these are [[Father Christmas]], also known as [[Santa Claus]], Père Noël, and the [[Weihnachtsmann]]; [[Saint Nicholas]] or [[Sinterklaas]]; the [[Christkind]]; Kris Kringle; [[Joulupukki]]; Babbo Natale; [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil]]; and [[Ded Moroz|Father Frost]].

The most famous and pervasive of these figures in modern celebration worldwide is Santa Claus, a mythical gift bringer, dressed in red, whose origins have diverse sources. The name Santa Claus can be traced back to the Dutch ''Sinterklaas'', which means simply Saint Nicholas. Nicholas was Bishop of Myra, in modern day Turkey, during the 4th century. Among other saintly attributes, he was noted for the care of Children, generosity, and the giving of gifts. His feast on the 6th of December came to be celebrated in many countries with the giving of gifts. Saint Nicholas traditionally appeared in bishop's attire, accompanied by helpers, inquiring about the behaviour of children during the past year before deciding whether they deserved a gift or not. By the 13th century, Saint Nicholas was well known in the Netherlands, and the practice of gift-giving in his name spread to other parts of central and southern Europe. At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th–17th century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''Christkindl'', corrupted in English to Kris Kringle, and the date of giving gifts changed from December the 6th to Christmas Eve.&lt;ref name=ADS&gt;Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', University of California Press, 2007, ISBN 0-520-25104-0, pp. 68–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern popular image of Santa Claus, however, was created in the United States, and in particular in New York. The transformation was accomplished with the aid of notable contributors including [[Washington Irving]] and the [[German American|German-American]] cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]] (1840–1902). Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], some of the inhabitants of New York City sought out symbols of the city's non-English past. New York had originally been established as the Dutch colonial town of [[New Amsterdam]] and the Dutch Sinterklaas tradition was reinvented as Saint Nicholas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=http://www.livius.org/ne-nn/nicholas/nicholas_of_myra3.html#New |title=Saint Nicholas, Sinterklaas, Santa Claus |publisher=Livius.org |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1809, the [[New-York Historical Society]] convened and retroactively named ''Sancte Claus'' the patron saint of [[New Amsterdam|Nieuw Amsterdam]], the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name for [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;John Steele Gordon, ''The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power: 1653–2000'' (Scribner) 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; At his first American appearance in 1810, Santa Claus was drawn in bishops' robes. However as new artists took over, Santa Claus developed more secular attire.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Nast drew a new image of &quot;Santa Claus&quot; annually, beginning in 1863. By the 1880s, Nast's Santa had evolved into the robed, fur clad, form we now recognize, perhaps based on the English figure of Father Christmas. The image was standardized by advertisers in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mikkelson&quot;&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara and David P., [http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/santa.asp &quot;The Claus That Refreshes&quot;], ''Snopes.com,'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Santa-eop2.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Santa Claus is famous around the world for giving gifts to good children]]
Father Christmas, a jolly, well nourished, bearded man who typified the spirit of good cheer at Christmas, predates the Santa Claus character. He is first recorded in early 17th century England, but was associated with holiday merrymaking and [[drunkenness]] rather than the bringing of gifts.&lt;ref name=Harper/&gt; In [[Victorian Britain]], his image was remade to match that of Santa. The French [[Père Noël]] evolved along similar lines, eventually adopting the Santa image. In Italy, Babbo Natale acts as Santa Claus, while [[La Befana]] is the bringer of gifts and arrives on the eve of the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]]. It is said that La Befana set out to bring the baby [[Jesus]] gifts, but got lost along the way. Now, she brings gifts to all children. In some cultures Santa Claus is accompanied by [[Knecht Ruprecht]], or [[Black Peter]]. In other versions, [[elf|elves]] make the toys. His wife is referred to as [[Mrs. Claus]].

There has been some opposition to the narrative of the American evolution of Saint Nicholas into the modern Santa. It has been claimed that the Saint Nicholas Society was not founded until 1835, almost half a century after the end of the American War of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Current tradition in several [[Latin American]] countries (such as [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]]) holds that while Santa makes the toys, he then gives them to the Baby Jesus, who is the one who actually delivers them to the children's homes, a reconciliation between traditional [[Religion|religious beliefs]] and the [[iconography]] of Santa Claus imported from the United States.

In [[South Tyrol]] (Italy), Austria, Czech Republic, Southern Germany, Hungary, [[Liechtenstein]], [[Slovakia]] and Switzerland, the [[Christkind]] ([[Ježíšek]] in Czech, Jézuska in Hungarian and Ježiško in Slovak) brings the presents. The German St. Nikolaus is not identical with the Weihnachtsmann (who is the German version of Santa Claus/Father Christmas). St. Nikolaus wears a [[bishop]]'s dress and still brings small gifts (usually candies, nuts and fruits) on December 6 and is accompanied by [[Knecht Ruprecht]]. Although many parents around the world routinely teach their children about Santa Claus and other gift bringers, some have come to reject this practice, considering it deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;Matera, Mariane.

===Pre-Christian background===
====''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti''====
{{Main|Sol Invictus}}
''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'' means &quot;the birthday of the unconquered sun&quot;.

Modern scholars have argued that the festival was placed on the date of the solstice because this was on this day that the Sun reversed its southward retreat and proved itself to be &quot;unconquered&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Some early Christian writers connected the rebirth of the sun to the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot;/&gt; &quot;O, how wonderfully acted Providence that on that day on which that Sun was born...Christ should be born&quot;, [[Cyprian]] wrote.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot;/&gt; [[John Chrysostom]] also commented on the connection: &quot;They call it the 'Birthday of the Unconquered'.

Although ''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'' has been the subject of a great deal of scholarly speculation,.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} the only ancient source for it is a single mention in the [[Chronography of 354]], and modern Sol scholar Steven Hijmans argues that there is no evidence that the celebration precedes that of Christmas:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hijmans&quot;/&gt; &quot;[W]hile the winter solstice on or around the 25th of December was well established in the Roman imperial calendar, there is no evidence that a religious celebration of Sol on that day antedated the celebration of Christmas, and none that indicates that Aurelian had a hand in its institution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hijmans&quot;/&gt;

====Winter festivals====
{{Main|List of winter festivals}}
A winter festival was the most popular festival of the year in many cultures. Reasons included the fact that less agricultural work needs to be done during the winter, as well as an expectation of better weather as spring approached.&lt;ref name=AncientHoliday&gt;&quot;[http://www.history.com/minisites/christmas/viewPage?pageId=1252 &quot;Christmas – An Ancient Holiday&quot;], ''The [[History Channel]]'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Christmas customs include: gift-giving and merrymaking from Roman [[Saturnalia]]; greenery, lights, and charity from the Roman New Year; and [[Yule log]]s and various foods from [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] feasts.&lt;ref&gt;Coffman, Elesha.

===Christian feast===
The [[New Testament]] does not give a date for the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9082431/Christmas Christmas], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Around AD 200, [[Clement of Alexandria]] wrote that a group in Egypt celebrated the nativity on 25 [[Pashons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot;/&gt; This corresponds to May 20.&lt;ref&gt;Roll, p. 78, citing calculations by Roger Beckworth. Roll, pp. 79–80, then cites Roland Bainton to say that Clement may have used two separate calendars and the discrepancies between them eventually &quot;yields 6 January, in 2 CE&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] (d. 220) does not mention Christmas as a major [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] in the [[African Rite|Church of Roman Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot; /&gt; However, in ''Chronographai'', a reference work published in 221, [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] suggested that Jesus was conceived on the [[spring equinox]], popularizing the idea that Christ was born on December 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9082431/Christmas &quot;Christmas], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roll, p. 79, 80. Only fragments of ''Chronographai'' survive. In one fragment, Africanus referred to &quot;Pege in Bethlehem&quot; and &quot;Lady Pege, Spring-bearer.&quot; See &quot;[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VI/Julius Africanus/Narrative of Events Happening in Persia on the Birth of Christ|Narrative Narrative of Events Happening in Persia on the Birth of Christ Narrative]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The equinox was March 25 on the Roman calendar, so this implied a birth in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradt&quot;&gt;Bradt, Hale, ''Astronomy Methods'', (2004), p. 69.&lt;br /&gt;Roll p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; ''De Pascha Computus'', a calendar of feasts produced in 243, gives March 28 as the date of the nativity.&lt;ref&gt;Roll p.81f&lt;/ref&gt; In 245, the theologian [[Origen of Alexandria]] stated that, &quot;only sinners (like Pharaoh and Herod)&quot; celebrated their birthdays.&lt;ref name=&quot;Origin&quot;&gt;Origen, &quot;Levit., Hom. VIII&quot;; ''Migne P.G.'', XII, 495.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10709a.htm Natal Day]&quot;, ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; In 303, Christian writer [[Arnobius]] ridiculed the idea of celebrating the birthdays of gods. However, since Christmas does not celebrate Christ's birth &quot;as God&quot; but &quot;as man&quot;, this is not evidence against Christmas being a feast at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot; /&gt; Moreover, the fact that the innovation rejecting [[Donatist]] Church of North Africa celebrated Christmas suggests that the feast had been established before the living memory of those who began that Church in [[311]].

====Feast established====
The earliest known reference to the date of the nativity as December 25 is found in the [[Chronography of 354]], an [[illuminated manuscript]] compiled in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;This document was prepared privately for a Roman aristocrat. The reference in question states, &quot;VIII kal. ian. natus Christus in Betleem Iudeæ&quot;.[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronography_of_354_08_fasti.htm] It is in a section copied from an earlier manuscript produced in 336.[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03724b.htm] This document also contains the earliest known reference to the feast of Sol Invictus.[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/chronography_of_354_06_calendar.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In the East, early Christians celebrated the birth of Christ as part of [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] (January 6), although this festival emphasized celebration of the [[baptism of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pokhilko, Hieromonk Nicholas, [http://sites.google.com/site/historyofepiphany &quot;History of Epiphany&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christmas was promoted in the Christian East as part of the revival of [[Catholicism]] following the death of the pro-[[Arianism|Arian]] Emperor [[Valens]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. The feast was introduced to [[Constantinople]] in 379, and to [[Antioch]] in about 380. The feast disappeared after [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] resigned as [[bishop]] in 381, although it was reintroduced by [[John Chrysostom]] in about 400.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathChrit&quot; /&gt;

====Middle Ages====
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Christmas Day was overshadowed by Epiphany, which in the west focused on the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|magi]]. But the Medieval calendar was dominated by Christmas-related holidays. The forty days before Christmas became the &quot;forty days of St. Martin&quot; (which began on November 11, the feast of [[St. Martin of Tours]]), now known as Advent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;&gt;Murray, Alexander, [http://www.historytoday.com/dt_main_allatonce.asp?gid=13022&amp;aid=&amp;tgid=&amp;amid=13022&amp;g13022=x&amp;g9142=x&amp;g30026=x&amp;g20991=x&amp;g21010=x&amp;g19965=x&amp;g19963=x&amp;e=true &quot;Medieval Christmas&quot;], ''History Today'', December 1986, '''36''' (12), pp. 31 – 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, former [[Saturnalia]]n traditions were attached to Advent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt; Around the 12th century, these traditions transferred again to the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] (December 25 – January 5); a time that appears in the liturgical calendars as [[Christmastide]] or [[Twelve Holy Days]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt;

The prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after [[Charlemagne]] was crowned Emperor on Christmas Day in 800. King [[Edmund the Martyr]] was anointed on Christmas in 855 and King [[William I of England]] was crowned on Christmas Day 1066.

By the [[High Middle Ages]], the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where various [[magnate]]s celebrated Christmas. [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]] of England hosted a Christmas feast in 1377 at which twenty-eight oxen and three hundred sheep were eaten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt; The Yule boar was a common feature of medieval Christmas feasts. [[Christmas carol|Caroling]] also became popular, and was originally a group of dancers who sang. The group was composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus. Various writers of the time condemned caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly traditions of Saturnalia and Yule may have continued in this form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt; &quot;Misrule&quot;—drunkenness, promiscuity, gambling—was also an important aspect of the festival. In England, gifts were exchanged on [[New Year's Day]], and there was special Christmas ale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt;

Christmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival that incorporated [[ivy]], [[holly]], and other evergreens.&lt;ref name=mcgreevy/&gt; Christmas [[gift-giving]] during the Middle Ages was usually between people with legal relationships, such as tenant and landlord.&lt;ref name=mcgreevy&gt;McGreevy, Patrick. &quot;Place in the American Christmas,&quot; ([http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0016-7428%28199001%2980%3A1%3C32%3APITAC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-2 JSTOR]), ''Geographical Review'', Vol. 80, No. 1. January 1990, pp. 32–42. Retrieved September 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual indulgence in eating, dancing, singing, sporting, card playing escalated in England, and by the 17th century the Christmas season featured lavish dinners, elaborate masques and pageants. In 1607, [[James I of England|King James I]] insisted that a play be acted on Christmas night and that the court indulge in games.&lt;ref name=BTR/&gt; It was during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th–17th century Europe, that many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''[[Christkindl]]'', and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.&lt;ref name=ADS/&gt;

===Reformation into the 19th century===
[[File:Scrooges third visitor-John Leech,1843.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Ebenezer Scrooge]] and the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]]. From [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', 1843]]
Following the [[Protestant Reformation]], groups such as the [[Puritan]]s strongly condemned the celebration of Christmas, considering it a Catholic invention and the &quot;trappings of [[Papist|popery]]&quot; or the &quot;rags of [[The Beast (Bible)|the Beast]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Durston&quot;&gt;Durston, Chris, [http://www.historytoday.com/dt_main_allatonce.asp?gid=12890&amp;aid=&amp;tgid=&amp;amid=12890&amp;g12890=x&amp;g9130=x&amp;g30026=x&amp;g20991=x&amp;g21010=x&amp;g19965=x&amp;g19963=x &quot;Lords of Misrule: The Puritan War on Christmas 1642–60&quot;], ''History Today'', December 1985, '''35''' (12) pp. 7 – 14.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Catholic Church]] responded by promoting the festival in a more religiously oriented form. King [[Charles I of England]] directed his noblemen and gentry to return to their landed estates in midwinter to keep up their old style Christmas generosity.&lt;ref name=BTR/&gt; Following the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] victory over Charles I during the [[English Civil War]], England's [[Puritan]] rulers banned Christmas in 1647.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durston&quot;/&gt; Protests followed as pro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities and for weeks [[Canterbury]] was controlled by the rioters, who decorated doorways with [[holly]] and shouted royalist slogans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durston&quot;/&gt; The book, ''The Vindication of Christmas'' (London, 1652), argued against the Puritans, and makes note of Old English Christmas traditions, dinner, roast apples on the fire, card playing, dances with &quot;plow-boys&quot; and &quot;maidservants&quot;, and carol singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mercuriuspoliticus.wordpress.com/2008/12/21/a-christmassy-post/ |title=A Christmassy post &amp;#124; Mercurius Politicus |publisher=Mercuriuspoliticus.wordpress.com |date=2008-12-21 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1660 ended the ban, but many clergymen still disapproved of Christmas celebration. In [[Scotland]], the Presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]] also discouraged observance of Christmas. James VI commanded its celebration in 1618, however attendance at church was scant.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. p. 211.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Colonial America]], the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Puritans]] of [[New England]] shared radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas. Celebration was outlawed in [[Boston]] from 1659 to 1681. The ban by the Pilgrims was revoked in 1681 by English governor [[Sir Edmund Andros]], however it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apuritansmind.com/Christmas/DankoChristmasBanned.htm |title=When Christmas Was Banned – The early colonies and Christmas |publisher=Apuritansmind.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the same time, Christian residents of [[Virginia]] and [[NY|New York]] observed the holiday freely. [[Pennsylvania German]] Settlers, pre-eminently the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] settlers of [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania|Nazareth]] and [[Lititz]] in Pennsylvania and the [[Wachovia, North Carolina|Wachovia]] Settlements in North Carolina, were enthusiastic celebrators of Christmas.

Moravian Christmas in the South. p. 20. 2007 ISBN 0-8078-3181-6&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas fell out of favor in the United States after the [[American Revolution]], when it was considered an English custom.&lt;ref name=&quot;cinne&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Andrews | first =Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Christmas in Colonial and Early America | publisher =World Book Encyclopedia, Inc. |year=1975 | location =USA | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 7-166-2001-4}}

[[George Washington]] attacked [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] (German) mercenaries on Christmas during the [[Battle of Trenton]] in 1777, Christmas being much more popular in Germany than in America at this time.

By the 1820s, [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] tension had eased in Britain and writers, including William Winstanly, began to worry that Christmas was dying out. These writers imagined [[Tudor period|Tudor]] Christmas as a time of heartfelt celebration, and efforts were made to revive the holiday. In 1843, Charles Dickens wrote the novel ''A Christmas Carol'', that helped revive the 'spirit' of Christmas and seasonal merriment.&lt;ref name=standiford&gt;Les Standiford.

&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens sought to construct Christmas as a family-centered festival of generosity, in contrast to the community-based and church-centered observations, the observance of which had dwindled during the late 18th century and early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Hutton]] ''Stations of the Sun: The Ritual Year in England''. 1996. Oxford: Oxford University Press.

In Britain, the [[Christmas tree#18th and 19th centuries|Christmas tree]] was introduced in the early 19th century following the personal union with the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], by [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], Queen to King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. In 1832 a young [[Queen Victoria]] wrote about her delight at having a Christmas tree, hung with [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|lights]], [[Christmas ornaments|ornaments]], and [[presents]] placed round it.&lt;ref&gt;The girlhood of Queen Victoria: a selection from Her Majesty's diaries. p.61.

In America, interest in Christmas had been revived in the 1820s by several [[Short story|short stories]] by [[Washington Irving]] which appear in his ''[[The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon]]'' and &quot;Old Christmas&quot;. Irving's stories depicted harmonious warm-hearted English Christmas festivities he experienced while staying in [[Aston Hall]], Birmingham, England, that had largely been abandoned,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Richard Michael (ed.)

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1822, [[Clement Clarke Moore]] wrote the poem ''[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]'' (popularly known by its first line: ''Twas the Night Before Christmas'').&lt;ref&gt;Moore's poem transferred the genuine old Dutch traditions celebrated at New Year in New York, including the exchange of gifts, family feasting, and tales of “sinterklass” (a derivation in Dutch from “Saint Nicholas,” from whence comes the modern “Santa Claus”) to Christmas.[http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/ch/in_america.htm ''The history of Christmas: Christmas history in America''], 2006
&lt;/ref&gt;
The poem helped popularize the tradition of exchanging gifts, and seasonal Christmas shopping began to assume economic importance.&lt;ref&gt;usinfo.state.gov [http://usinfo.state.gov/scv/Archive/2005/Dec/19-344398.html “Americans Celebrate Christmas in Diverse Ways”] November 26, 2006

This also started the cultural conflict of the holiday's spiritualism and its [[commercialism]] that some see as corrupting the holiday.

==Controversy and criticism==
{{Main|Christmas controversy}}
Throughout the holiday's history, Christmas has been the subject of both controversy and criticism from a wide variety of different sources. The first documented Christmas controversy was Christian-led, and began during the [[English Interregnum]], when England was ruled by a [[Puritan]] [[Parliament of England|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timetravel-britain.com/articles/christmas/ban.shtml |title=Marta Patiño, The Puritan Ban on Christmas |publisher=Timetravel-britain.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Puritans]] (including those who fled to America) sought to remove the remaining pagan elements of Christmas. During this period, the English Parliament banned the celebration of Christmas entirely, considering it &quot;a [[popish]] festival with no biblical justification&quot;, and a time of wasteful and immoral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In November 2009, the [[Federal appeals court]] in Philadelphia endorsed a school district's ban on the singing of Christmas carols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the private sphere also, it has been alleged that any specific mention of the term &quot;Christmas&quot; or its [[religious]] aspects was being increasingly [[censorship|censored]], avoided, or discouraged by a number of [[advertising|advertisers]] and retailers. In response, the [[American Family Association]] and other groups have organized boycotts of individual retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.afa.net/Detail.aspx?id=2147489466 |title=Boycott Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic this Christmas |publisher=Action.afa.net |date= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[United Kingdom]] there have also been some controversies, one of the most famous being the temporary promotion of the Christmas period as [[Winterval]] by Birmingham City Council in 1998. There were also protests in November 2009 when the city of [[Dundee]] promoted its celebrations as the ''Winter Night Light festival'', initially with no specific Christmas references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=April Mitchinson |url=http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1502592?UserKey=|title=Differences set aside for Winter Night Light festival in Dundee |publisher=The Press and Journal|date=2009-11-29 |accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christmas is typically the largest annual economic stimulus for many nations around the world. Sales increase dramatically in almost all retail areas and shops introduce new products as people purchase gifts, decorations, and supplies. In the U.S., the &quot;Christmas shopping season&quot; starts as early as October.&lt;ref&gt;Varga, Melody. [http://retailindustry.about.com/od/abouttheretailindustry/g/black_friday.htm &quot;Black Friday], ''About:Retail Industry''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womeninbusiness.about.com/od/womeninbusinessanswers/a/Wib-Answers-What-Is-The-Definition-Of-Christmas-Creep.htm |title=Definition Christmas Creep - What is Christmas Creep |publisher=Womeninbusiness.about.com |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, merchants begin advertising campaigns just before [[Halloween]] (October 31), and step up their marketing following Remembrance Day on November 11. In the UK and Ireland, the Christmas shopping season starts from mid November, around the time when high street [[Christmas lights]] are turned on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/whatson/south-molton-street-christmas-lights-feature-3530.html South Molton and Brook Street Christmas Lights] (Tuesday 16th November 2010) ''View London.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gar&gt;Julia Kollewe Monday (29 November 2010) [http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/nov/29/christmas-shopping-spree-starts West End spree worth £250m marks start of Christmas shopping season] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, it has been calculated that a quarter of all personal spending takes place during the Christmas/holiday shopping season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ECONOMICS REPORT – Holiday Shopping Season in the U.S.|date=2004-12-03|author=Gwen Outen|url=http://voanews.com/specialenglish/archive/2004-12/a-2004-12-03-2-1.cfm|publisher=Voice Of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] reveal that expenditure in department stores nationwide rose from $20.8 billion in November 2004 to $31.9 billion in December 2004, an increase of 54 percent. In other sectors, the pre-Christmas increase in spending was even greater, there being a November – December buying surge of 100 percent in bookstores and 170 percent in jewelry stores. In the same year employment in American retail stores rose from 1.6 million to 1.8 million in the two months leading up to Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;US Census Bureau. [http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/005870.html &quot;Facts. The Holiday Season&quot;] December 19, 2005. (accessed Nov 30 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Industries completely dependent on Christmas include [[Christmas card]]s, of which 1.9 billion are sent in the United States each year, and live Christmas Trees, of which 20.8 million were cut in the USA in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;US Census 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK in 2010, up to £8 billion was expected to be spent online at Christmas, approximately a quarter of total retail festive sales.&lt;ref name=gar/&gt;

In most Western nations, Christmas Day is the least active day of the year for business and commerce; almost all retail, commercial and institutional businesses are closed, and almost all industries cease activity (more than any other day of the year), whether laws require such or not. In [[England and Wales]], the [[Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004]] prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. [[Scotland]] is currently planning similar legislation. [[Film studio]]s release many high-budget movies during the holiday season, including Christmas films, [[fantasy]] movies or high-tone dramas with high production values.

One [[economist]]'s analysis calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a [[deadweight loss]] under orthodox [[microeconomic theory]], because of the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4 billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deadweight&quot;&gt;&quot;The Deadweight Loss of Christmas&quot;, ''American Economic Review'', December 1993, '''83''' (5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;econ&quot;&gt;[http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=885748 &quot;Is Santa a deadweight loss?&quot;] ''The Economist'' December 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as [[white elephant]]s, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters.

      <comment>r2.6.4) (robot Modifying: [[es:Contracción (espacio métrico)]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a '''contraction mapping''', or '''contraction''', on a [[metric space]] ''(M,d)'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' from ''M'' to itself, with the property that there is some nonnegative [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;k &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; such that for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''M'',
:&lt;math&gt;d(f(x),f(y))\leq k\,d(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;
The smallest such value of ''k'' is called the '''Lipschitz constant''' of ''f''.  Contractive maps are sometimes called '''Lipschitzian maps'''.  If the above condition is satisfied for
&lt;math&gt;k \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, then the mapping is said to be ''non-expansive''.

More generally, the idea of a contractive mapping can be defined for maps between metric spaces.  Thus, if ''(M,d)'' and ''(N,d')'' are two metric spaces, and &lt;math&gt;f:M\rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt;, then one looks for the constant ''k'' such that &lt;math&gt;d'(f(x),f(y))\leq k\,d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''M''.
 
Every contraction mapping is [[Lipschitz continuous]] and hence [[uniformly continuous]] (for a Lipschitz continuous function, the constant ''k'' is no longer necessarily less than 1).

A contraction mapping has at most one [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]. Moreover, the [[Banach fixed point theorem]] states that every contraction mapping on a nonempty [[completeness (topology)|complete]] metric space has a unique fixed point, and that for any ''x'' in ''M'' the [[iterated function]] sequence ''x'', ''f'' (''x''), ''f'' (''f'' (''x'')), ''f'' (''f'' (''f'' (''x''))), ... converges to the fixed point. This concept is very useful for [[iterated function systems]] where contraction mappings are often used. Banach's fixed point theorem is also applied in proving the existence of solutions of ordinary differential equations, and is used in one proof of the [[inverse function theorem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;shifrin&quot;&gt;Theodore Shifrin, ''Multivariable Mathematics'', Wiley, 2005, ISBN 0-471-52638-X, pp. 244–260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Firmly non-expansive mapping==
A non-expansive mapping with &lt;math&gt;k=1&lt;/math&gt; can be strengthened to a '''firmly non-expansive mapping''' in a [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' if the following holds for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''H'':
:&lt;math&gt;\|f(x)-f(y) \|^2 \leq \, \langle x-y, f(x) - f(y) \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \|x-y\|&lt;/math&gt;

This is a special case of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; averaged nonexpansive operators with &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''Solving monotone inclusions via compositions of nonexpansive averaged operators'', Patrick L. Combettes, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  A firmly non-expansive mapping is always non-expansive, via the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]].

'''On-sight''' climbing means to attempt a [[rock climbing]] [[route]] for the first time without inspection or any form of &quot;beta&quot; (such as route description, watching others climb it, etc.).

[[Climbing equipment]], such as [[Quickdraws]] or other protection equipment, is not pre-placed on the route during an on-sight. 

On-sighting is a form of [[adventure climbing]] emphasizing the skills of route finding, quick thinking and problem solving.

[[File:Covalent bond hydrogen.svg|thumb|A covalent bond forming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where two [[hydrogen atom]]s share the two electrons.]]
A '''covalent bond''' is a form of [[chemical bond]]ing that is characterized by the sharing of pairs of [[electron]]s between [[atom]]s, and other covalent bonds. In short, the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms when they share electrons is known as covalent bonding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Neil A.|authorlink=|coauthors=Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden|title=Biology: Exploring Life|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=|url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html|doi=|id=|isbn=0-13-250882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Covalent bonding includes many kinds of interaction, including [[sigma bond|σ-bonding]], [[pi bond|π-bonding]], &lt;!-- do not change the following--&gt;metal to metal bonding,&lt;!-- &quot;nonmetal/nonmetal&quot; is already covered as sigma/pi --&gt; [[agostic complex|agostic interaction]]s, and [[three-center two-electron bond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;March, J. “Advanced Organic Chemistry” 4th Ed. J. Wiley and Sons, 1991: New York. ISBN 0-471-60180-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. L. Miessler and D. A. Tarr “Inorganic Chemistry” 3rd Ed, Pearson/Prentice Hall publisher, ISBN 0-13-035471-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''covalent bond'' dates from 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[[Merriam-Webster]] - Collegiate Dictionary (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The prefix ''co-'' means ''jointly, associated in action, partnered to a lesser degree, '' etc.; thus a &quot;co-valent bond&quot;, essentially, means that the atoms share &quot;[[valence (chemistry)|valence]]&quot;, such as is discussed in [[valence bond theory]]. In the molecule H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the hydrogen atoms share the two electrons via covalent bonding. Covalency is greatest between atoms of similar [[electronegativity|electronegativities]]. Thus, covalent bonding does not necessarily require the two atoms be of the same elements, only that they be of comparable electronegativity. Although covalent bonding entails sharing of electrons, it is not necessarily [[delocalized electron|delocalized]]. Furthermore, in contrast to electrostatic interactions (&quot;[[ionic bond]]s&quot;) the strength of covalent bond depends on the angular relation between atoms in polyatomic molecules.

==History==
[[Image:covalent.svg|thumb|200px|Early concepts in covalent bonding arose from this kind of image of the molecule of [[methane]]. Covalent bonding is implied in the [[Lewis structure]] that indicates sharing of electrons between atoms.]]

The term &quot;covalence&quot; in regard to bonding was first used in 1919 by [[Irving Langmuir]] in a ''Journal of the American Chemical Society'' article entitled &quot;The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules&quot;. Langmuir wrote that &quot;we shall denote by the term '''covalence''' the number of pairs of electrons which a given atom shares with its neighbors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: doi=10.1021/ja02227a002|doi=10.1021/ja02227a002|volume=41|issue=6|pages=868–934|last=Langmuir|first=Irving|title=The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|accessdate=2009-11-10|date=1919-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of covalent bonding can be traced several years before 1919 to [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], who in 1916 described the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: doi=10.1021/ja02261a002|doi=10.1021/ja02261a002|volume=38|issue=4|pages=762–785|last=Lewis|first=Gilbert N.|title=THE ATOM AND THE MOLECULE.|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|accessdate=2009-11-10|date=1916-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the ''[[Lewis Structure|Lewis notation]]'' or ''electron dot notation'' or ''Lewis dot structure'' in which valence electrons (those in the outer shell) are represented as dots around the atomic symbols. Pairs of electrons located between atoms represent covalent bonds. Multiple pairs represent multiple bonds, such as double and triple bonds. Some examples of Electron Dot Notation are shown in the following figure. An alternative form of representation, not shown here, has bond-forming electron pairs represented as solid lines.
While the idea of shared electron pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of covalent bonding, [[quantum mechanics]] is needed to understand the nature of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules. [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]] are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a chemical bond, specifically that of [[molecular hydrogen]], in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;W. Heitler and F. London, Zeitschrift für Physik, vol. 44, p. 455 (1927). English translation in H. Hettema, Quantum Chemistry, Classic Scientific Papers, World Scientific, Singapore (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Their work was based on the valence bond model, which assumes that a chemical bond is formed when there is good overlap between the [[atomic orbitals]] of participating atoms. These atomic orbitals are known to have specific angular relationships between each other, and thus the valence bond model can successfully predict the bond angles observed in simple molecules.

==Polarity of covalent bonds==

Covalent bonds are affected by the electronegativity of the connected atoms. Two atoms with equal electronegativity will make non-polar covalent bonds such as H-H. An unequal relationship creates a [[polar covalent bond]] such as with H-Cl.

== Subdivision of covalent bonds ==
There are three types of covalent substances: individual molecules, molecular structures, and macromolecular structures. Individual molecules have strong bonds which hold the atoms together, but there are negligible forces of attraction between molecules. Such covalent substances are gases. For example, HCl, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. In molecular structures there are weak forces of attraction. Such covalent substances are low boiling temperature liquids (such as [[ethanol]]), and low melting temperature solids (such as [[iodine]] and solid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Macromolecular structures have large numbers of atoms linked in chains or sheets (such as [[graphite]]), or in 3-dimensional structures (such as [[diamond]] and [[quartz]]). These substances have high melting and boiling points, are frequently brittle, and tend to have high electrical [[resistivity]]. Elements that have high [[electronegativity]], and the ability to form three or four electron pair bonds, often form such large macromolecular structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;StranksEtAl1970&quot;&gt;

'''Condensation polymers''' are any kind of [[polymer]]s formed through a [[condensation reaction]], releasing small molecules as by-products such as water or methanol, as opposed to [[addition polymer]]s which involve the reaction of [[unsaturated monomer]]s. Types of condensation polymers include [[polyamide]]s, [[polyacetal]]s and [[polyester]]s.

Condensation polymerization, a form of [[step-growth polymerization]], is a process by which two molecules join together, resulting loss of small molecules which is often water. The type of end product resulting from a condensation polymerization is dependent on the number of functional end groups of the monomer which can react. 

Monomers with only one reactive group terminate a growing chain, and thus give end products with a lower molecular weight. Linear polymers are created using monomers with two reactive end groups and monomers with more than two end groups give three dimensional polymers which are crosslinked.

[[Dehydration synthesis]] often involves joining monomers with an -OH (hydroxyl) group and a freely ionized -H on either end (such as a hydrogen from the -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in [[nylon]] or [[proteins]]). Normally, two or more different monomers are used in the reaction. The bonds between the hydroxyl group, the hydrogen atom and their respective atoms break forming water from the hydroxyl and hydrogen, and the polymer.

[[Polyester]] is created through [[ester]] linkages between monomers, which involve the functional groups [[carboxyl]] and [[hydroxyl]] (an organic acid and an alcohol monomer). 

[[Nylon]] is another common condensation polymer. It can be manufactured by reacting [[amine|di-amines]] with carboxyl derivatives. In this example the derivative is a [[carboxylic acid|di-carboxylic acid]], but [[acyl chloride|di-acyl chlorides]] are also used.  Another approach used is the reaction of di-functional monomers, with one amine and one carboxylic acid group on the same molecule:

:[[Image:Condensation polymerization diacid diamine.svg|thumb|left|400px|General chemical structure of one type of condensation polymer]]{{clear}}

The carboxylic acids and amines link to form [[peptide bond]]s, also known as [[amide]] groups. [[Protein]]s are condensation polymers made from [[amino acid]] monomers. Carbohydrates are also condensation polymers made from sugar monomers such as glucose and galactose. 

Condensation polymerization is occasionally used to form simple hydrocarbons. This method, however, is expensive and inefficient, so the [[addition polymer]] of ethene (polyethylene) is generally used.

Condensation polymers, unlike [[addition polymer]]s, may be biodegradable. The peptide or ester bonds between monomers can be hydrolysed by acid catalysts or bacterial [[enzyme]]s breaking the polymer chain into smaller pieces.

The most commonly known condensation polymers are proteins, fabrics such as nylon, [[silk]], or [[polyester]].

'''Colorado Springs''' is a [[Colorado municipalities#Home Rule Municipality|Home Rule Municipality]] that is the [[county seat]] and most populous city of [[El Paso County, Colorado|El Paso County]], Colorado, United States. Colorado Springs is located in South-Central Colorado, in the southern portion of the state. It is situated on [[Fountain Creek]] and is located {{convert|61|mi|km|0|sp=us}} south of the [[Colorado State Capitol]] in [[Denver]]. At 6,035 feet (1839 m) the city stands over one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) above sea level, though some areas of the city are significantly higher. Colorado Springs is situated near the base of one of the most famous American mountains, [[Pikes Peak]], at the eastern edge of the  [[Southern Rocky Mountains]].

==History==
{{Refimprove|section|date=August 2007}}

===General Palmer, city founder===
[[Image:Colorado Springs General William Palmer by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[General William Palmer]] in front of Palmer High School.]]
[[Image:Detroit Photographic Company (0251).jpg|thumb|The Antlers]]

[[General William Palmer|William Jackson Palmer]], a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[General officer|General]] ([[Brevet (military)#American_Civil_War|brevet]]) and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient, came to the [[Colorado Territory]] as a surveyor with the [[Kansas Pacific Railroad]]. He explored the area south of Denver searching for possible railroad routes for the Kansas Pacific to strategically occupy.&lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;Taming a Wilderness&quot; http://www.ghostdepot.com/rg/library/magazine/taming%201.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer favorably viewed the valley in the shadow of [[Pikes Peak]] as an ideal town site.&lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;Bristol&quot; http://www.d11.org/bristol/Bristol_wall/1860/front_1860_palmer.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Since he could not persuade the Kansas Pacific to follow the Arkansas River to Pueblo and from there north to Denver, Palmer secured legislation and funding to build the [[Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad]] south from Denver with the declared intention of reaching [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;name=Taming a Wilderness&quot;&gt;name=&quot;Taming a Wilderness&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer founded Colorado Springs on July 31, 1871,&lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;Bristol&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; as the first destination served by his railroad. He had the intention of creating a high-quality resort community, and the infant town was soon nicknamed &quot;Little London&quot; because of the many English tourists who came, owing partly to Palmer's financial connections in [[England]] who provided the capital for his railroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;name=Taming a Wilderness&quot;/&gt; The stunning mountain view from anywhere in the valley as well as the nearby [[Garden of the Gods]] made the city's location a natural choice.

Within two years, his flagship resort the Antlers Hotel opened, welcoming US and international travelers as well as health-savvy individuals seeking the high altitude, sunshine, and dry climate, and Palmer's visions of a thriving, quality resort town were coming true. Palmer's Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad became a critical regional railroad, faithfully serving the city and propelling the railroad south toward Pueblo. He maintained his presence in the city's early days by making many grants or sales of land to civic institutions. Palmer and his wife saw Colorado Springs develop into one of the most popular travel destinations in the late 19th century United States.

The town of [[Palmer Lake, Colorado|Palmer Lake]], the [[Palmer Divide]], and other more minor features are named after him, and a bronze sculpture of Palmer on a horse is prominently displayed downtown in front of Palmer High School, at the center of a busy intersection. To many residents who lived in Colorado Springs in the years since, Palmer became known as &quot;the man on the [[iron horse]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Man on the Iron Horse'' by Rhoda Davis Wilcox&lt;/ref&gt; a fitting appellation because of his long association with the Rio Grande Railroad.

===Old Colorado City and the Pikes Peak Gold Rush===
[[Image:Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|[http://www.springsgov.com/SectionIndex.asp?SectionID=9 The Pioneers Museum] (old court house) contains displays of the city's founding and history.]]

Colorado Springs' present downtown location, where General Palmer first founded the city, was partly due to Palmer's dislike of nearby rough-and-ready Colorado City (now called [[Old Colorado City]], and not to be confused with present-day [[Colorado City, Colorado|Colorado City]]) and its many saloons. Palmer ensured his new planned city stayed alcohol free by buying a huge tract of land to the east of Colorado City. Legally, Colorado Springs stayed dry until the end of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in 1933, but practically, alcohol was readily available. Conveniently located druggists advertised whiskey, ale, stout and beer for &quot;medicinal purposes.&quot;

In its earliest days of 1859–1860, Colorado City was a major hub for sending mining supplies to [[South Park (Colorado basin)|South Park]], where a major strike in the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]] was found. After the [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] gold discovery in 1891, ore mills in Colorado City processed much of the gold ore at the Golden Cycle Mill using Palmer's railroads. The affluent, who made money from the gold rush and industry, did not stay in Colorado City but built their large houses in the undeveloped downtown area of Colorado Springs (i.e. Wood Ave). Early pictures show several large stone buildings like [http://ppld.org/SpecialCollections/Project/admin/FullDisplay.asp?ID=113 Colorado College], St. Mary's, the library, and the county courthouse&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ppld.org/SpecialCollections/Project/admin/FullDisplay.asp?ID=6443|accessdate=}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; sitting in large empty plains. This is unique during this period, to anticipate a city's civic infrastructure in stone with wide streets laid out&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ppld.org/SpecialCollections/Project/admin/FullDisplay.asp?ID=4078|accessdate= }}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; before there was a population to justify the expense.

Colorado City remained the county seat of El Paso County until 1873, when the courthouse moved to Colorado Springs. Colorado City was the location of a 1903 labor strike that spread to [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] and eventually led to the [[Colorado Labor Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, George G. Suggs, Jr., 1972, page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===W. S. Stratton, early benefactor===
In 1891, [[Winfield Scott Stratton]] discovered and developed [[Stratton's Independence Mine and Mill|one of the richest gold mines on earth]] in the nearby [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] and [[Victor, Colorado|Victor]] area, and was perhaps the most generous early contributor to those communities and to Colorado Springs.

After he made his fortune he declined to build a mansion as the other gold rush millionaires were doing; instead, in later years, he lived in a house in Colorado Springs he had built when he was a carpenter in pre-gold days.
[[Image:Tesla colorado.jpg|thumb|A publicity photo of [[Nikola Tesla]] sitting in the ''Colorado Springs experimental station'' with his &quot;[[Magnifying transmitter]]&quot; generating millions of volts.]]
In Colorado Springs, he funded the Myron Stratton Home for housing itinerant children and the elderly, donated land for City Hall, the Post Office, the Courthouse (which now houses the Pioneer Museum), and a park; he also greatly expanded the city's trolley car system and built the Mining Exchange building, and gave to all three communities in many other ways, great and small.

As Stratton's generosity became known, he was also approached by many people looking for money, and he became reclusive and eccentric in his later years.

===Spencer Penrose, early benefactor===
[[Spencer Penrose]] also made his mark on Colorado Springs in its early years—though not until two decades after its founding. Penrose started as a ladies-man and an adventurer. After making a fortune in the gold fields of nearby Cripple Creek in the 1890s, he married Julie Villiers Lewis McMillan, and settled down.

Penrose used his wealth to invest in other national mineral concerns and financed construction of the [[Broadmoor Hotel]], the [[Cheyenne Mountain Zoo]], the [[Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun]], the Pikes Peak Highway, what is now known as Penrose-St Francis Health Services, and established the El Pomar Foundation, which still oversees many of his contributions in Colorado Springs today.

===End of the Colorado Gold Rush and the start of health tourism===
The flow of gold and silver ebbed as the decades passed, and Colorado City's economic fortunes faded with it; the miners and those who processed the ore left or retired. Because of the healthy{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} natural scenic beauty, mineral waters, and extremely dry climate, Colorado Springs became a tourist attraction and popular recuperation destination for [[tuberculosis]] patients. The healthy waters in Colorado Springs contained so much natural [[fluoride]] that some peoples’ teeth developed [[Dental fluorosis|Colorado Stain]]. In 1909, Dr. [[Frederick McKay]] of Colorado Springs discovered the Colorado Stain connection and that a little fluoride added to water would prevent [[Dental caries|cavities]], according to the permanent health exhibit at the [http://www.springsgov.com/SectionIndex.asp?SectionID=9 Pioneers Museum]. On June 14, 1950 Colorado Springs annexed [http://abstusa.com/co/roswell Roswell] which was founded in 1888 by coal miners and became a neighborhood. Other locations such as Austin Bluffs, Broadmoor, Woodman Valley, [http://abstusa.com/co/pikeview Pikeview], [http://abstusa.com/co/papeton Papeton], [http://abstusa.com/co/knob-hill Knob Hill], [http://abstusa.com/co/ivywild Ivywild], [http://abstusa.com/co/stratton-meadows Stratton Meadows], [http://abstusa.com/co/stratmoor Stratmoor], [http://abstusa.com/co/elsmere Elsmare], [http://abstusa.com/co/cimarron-hills Cimarron Hills], [http://abstusa.com/co/kelker Kelker], [http://abstusa.com/co/stratmoor-hills Stratmoor Hills], [http://abstusa.com/co/la-foret La Foret], [http://abstusa.com/co/skinners Skinners],
and Colorado City (now called [[Old Colorado City]]) became part of Colorado Springs. Old Colorado City is located on the west side of Colorado Springs and is a [[historic district]] and on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Its old [[Victorian era|Victorian]] brick buildings and main street currently offer several tourist, boutique, and antique shops.

===Latter 20th century military boom===
Colorado Springs saw its first military base in 1942 shortly after Pearl Harbor was attacked. For several years the city had been trying to attract a military installation to boost its flagging economy. In 1941, the city purchased {{convert|25000|acre|km2}} of what is now Fort Carson to try to lure a prospective Army installation. During this time the U.S. Army established [[Fort Carson|Camp Carson]] near the southern borders of the city in order to train and house troops in preparation for World War II. It was also during this time that the Army began using [[Colorado Springs Municipal Airport]]. It was renamed [[Peterson Air Force Base|Peterson Field]] and used as a training base for heavy bombers (the airport and base still share parts of the flightline).
[[Image:Colorado Springs, downtown, 1950's.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hi-res [[Kodachrome]] of downtown Colorado Springs, 1951.]]
The Army expanded Camp Carson, a venture that increased growth in Colorado Springs and provided a significant area of industry for the city. Camp Carson was named for the Army scout General Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Carson, who explored the vast western frontier during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdphe.state.co.us/hm/ftcarson.htm |title=Fort Carson, Colorado |publisher=Cdphe.state.co.us |date=October 29, 1995 |accessdate=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II the military stepped away from the Springs, Camp Carson was declining and the military was activating and deactivating Peterson Field irregularly. That all changed when the [[Korean War]] erupted. Camp Carson, which had declined to only 600 soldiers, was revitalized along with many other parts of the Springs. In 1951, the United States Air Defense Command moved to Colorado Springs and opened [[Ent Air Force Base]] (named for Major General [[Uzal Girard Ent]], commander of the [[Ninth Air Force]] during World War II).

After the Korean War, Peterson Field was renamed Peterson Air Force Base and was permanently activated. In 1954 Camp Carson became Fort Carson, Colorado Springs' first Army [[Military base|post]]. Later that same year, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] selected Colorado Springs, out of 300 other sites around the nation, to be the site of the [[United States Air Force Academy]]. A new and growing Army post, an Air Force Base, and the Air Force's military academy together jump-started Colorado Springs' growth.

The military boom continued and in 1963, [[NORAD]]'s main facility was built in [[Cheyenne Mountain]]. This placed NORAD directly next to Colorado Springs and permanently secured the city's military presence. During the Cold War the city greatly expanded due to increased revenue from various industries and the prevailing military presence in the city. In the mid 1970s, Ent Air Force Base was shut down and later converted into the [[United States Olympic Training Center]]. Military presence was further increased in 1983 with the founding of [[Schriever Air Force Base|Falcon Air Force Base]] (later changed to Schriever Air Force Base), a base primarily tasked with missile defense and satellite control. Fort Carson and Peterson are still growing and continue to contribute to the city's growth. [[Air Force Space Command]] is located on Peterson AFB.

Ackerman (1896–1988), a banker and rancher.&lt;ref&gt;Colorado historical marker, Interstate 25, Colorado Springs, Colorado&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Geography===
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 186.1 &amp;nbsp;square miles (482.1&amp;nbsp;km²), of which 185.7&amp;nbsp;square miles (481.1&amp;nbsp;km²) is land and 0.4&amp;nbsp;square mile (1.0&amp;nbsp;km²) (0.21%) is water.

===Climate===
Colorado Springs features a [[semi-arid climate]] (Köppen ''BSk''). The city receives approximately {{convert|16.2|in|cm|0}} of annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], which includes rain and snow. Snowfall rarely occurs outside the months between October and May with an average snowfall of {{convert|42.7|in|cm|0}}. Due to unusually low precipitation for several years after flooding in 1999, Colorado Springs enacted lawn water restrictions in 2002. These were lifted in 2005.&lt;ref name=SpringsGovInfo&gt;{{Cite web| date = November 3, 2010 | url = http://www.springsgov.com/Page.aspx?NavID=1188 | title=City of Colorado Springs – Drought}}&lt;/ref&gt;

January averages {{convert|28.1|F|1}}, yet the city has relatively mild winters, with large snow accumulations in the downtown area relatively rare, a strong warming sun due to the altitude, and only occasional episodic periods of sub-zero cold snaps and blizzards from October 31 to March/April. Snow often melts very quickly in arid climates as well, which makes the winters mild. Summers are very warm and dry, with a July average of {{convert|69.6|F|1}} and highs reaching {{convert|90|F|0}} on 16 days per annum. The normal high temperatures during the day are in the mid 80's into the low 90's, with cooler days in the low 80's and upper 70's. Also very hot days can reach the mid to upper 90's relatively often. The summers in Colorado Springs are generally hot and dry, but afternoon thunderstorms are common especially in July and August when the city receives the majority of its annual rainfall.

Colorado Springs is just east of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], which protects the city from extreme weather. The city is made up of the mountains to the west, the mountain divide to the north, high plains further east, and desert land to the south once you leave [[Fountain, Colorado|Fountain]] and approach [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]].

The winters in Colorado Springs are normal to mild usually, with winter snow storms occurring, but the snow often melts by the mid-to-late afternoon. The usual high temperatures in the winter are in the mid to upper 40s, with the lows in the mid to upper teens. Winter days into the 50's and 60's are relatively common as well. However, the mountains just west of the city can receive very large amounts of snow.

The hottest temperature ever recorded in Colorado Springs was {{convert|101|°F|0}} on June 7, 1874, and the coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-32|F|0}} on January 20, 1883. Although the coldest average monthly high temperature of the year in Colorado Springs has historically been January, in recent years December has had a colder average monthly high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/united-states/colorado/colorado-springs/ |title=Colorado Springs |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Climate-zone.com |accessdate=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorado Springs is also one of the most active lightning strike areas in the United States. This natural phenomenon led [[Nikola Tesla]] to select Colorado Springs as the preferred location to build his lab and study electricity.

==Government==
[[Image:Colorado Springs City Hall by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|City Hall.]]
Colorado Springs is a [[council-manager government]], with a mayor and city council that meets regularly to approve budgets, enact ordinances, and rule on land use, and a [[city manager]] who deals with the day-to-day aspects of running the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.springsgov.com/page.aspx?NavID=255 |title=City of Colorado Springs – City Council Members |publisher=Springsgov.com |date= |accessdate=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor is elected in a citywide vote. The city council consists of the mayor and eight additional members, four of whom are elected from districts and four who are elected at large. Both council members and the mayor are elected to four year terms and may serve two terms in both positions. A vice mayor is elected by council members from within their ranks.

On November 2, 2010 Colorado Springs voters adopted a [[strong mayor]]-council form of government. The City of Colorado Springs transitions to the new system of government in 2011. Under the strong mayor-council system of government, the mayor is the chief executive and the city council is the legislative branch. The mayor will be full-time and will no longer be a member of the city council. The city council will add one additional at-large member and stay at nine members. The mayor will have veto authority, with the city council having the ability to override a mayoral veto by a 2/3 votes (6 out of 9).

===Current issues===
In order to combat the nearly $38&amp;nbsp;million budget shortfall projected in 2010 caused by current economic conditions resulting in decreased sales taxes, a proposal to increase property taxes by $10&amp;nbsp;million over five years was approved for the November 2009 ballot by the city council on August 25, 2009. Issue 2C was voted down on November 3, 2009. An attempt to reform the city's Taxpayers Bill of Rights (TABOR) was considered but not put on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Daniel Chacón |url=http://www.gazette.com/news/formal-60744-ballot-city.html |title=Council's ballot proposals up for formal vote &amp;#124; formal, ballot, city – Public Affairs – Colorado Springs Gazette, CO |publisher=Gazette.com |date=August 25, 2009 |accessdate=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result the city reduced fire and police jobs, stopped paving roads, eliminated evening and weekend bus service, reduced public trash control, and asked residents to mow the grass in their neighborhood parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Michael Booth |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_14303473 |title=Colorado Springs cuts into services considered basic by many |publisher=denverpost.com |date=January 31, 2010 |accessdate=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Colorado Springs' economy is driven primarily by the military, the high-tech industry, and tourism, in that order. The city is currently experiencing some growth mainly in the service sectors.

===Defense industry===
The defense industry plays a major role in the Colorado Springs economy, with some of the city's largest employers coming from the sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.com/display.php?id=1321945&amp;secid=4 Colorado Springs Gazette&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large segment of this industry is dedicated to the development and operation of various projects for missile defense. With its close ties to defense, the aerospace industry has also influenced the Colorado Springs economy.

Significant defense corporations in the city include [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], [[Harris Corporation]], [[ITT Corporation|ITT]], [[L-3 Communications]], [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Intelligent Software Solutions]] and [[Northrop Grumman]].

===High-tech industry===
A large percentage of Colorado Springs' economy is still based on manufacturing [[high tech]] and complex electronic equipment.

The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), a component of America's missile defense system, is located in [[Cheyenne Mountain Air Station]].

Religious groups with regional or international headquarters in Colorado Springs include: the [[Association of Christian Schools International]], the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]], [[Compassion International]], Every Home for Christ, [[Focus on the Family]], [[HCJB]], the [[International Bible Society]], [[The Navigators (organization)|The Navigators]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Colorado Springs]], [[WAY-FM Media Group]], Andrew Wommack Ministries, and [[Young Life]]. The city is also home to one mosque, the [[Islamic Society of Colorado Springs]].

==Transportation==
Today, Colorado Springs has many features of a modern urban area, such as parks, bike trails, and urban open-area spaces. However, it is not exempt from problems that typically plague cities that experience tremendous growth like overcrowded roads and highways, crime, sprawl, and government budget issues. Many of the problems are indirectly or directly caused by the city's difficulty in coping with the large population growth experienced in the last 20 years and the annexing of the Banning Lewis Ranch area for 175,000 future residents.

Colorado Springs is served by a bus system called Mountain Metro (short for [[Mountain Metropolitan Transit]]). Mountain Metro also operates the [[Front Range Express (FREX)]] service, which connects Colorado Springs to Denver and several other metropolitan areas during weekdays. Although the transit system serves much of the city and its nearest suburbs, it lacks service to many important areas and has only limited hours of operation.

Colorado Springs is served by the [[Colorado Springs Municipal Airport]]. In the state of Colorado, only [[Denver International Airport|Denver International]] has more passenger traffic. The airport has experienced a higher recovery rate in the post-9/11 era than the rest of the country&lt;ref name = &quot;oolfhw&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.springsgov.com/AirportPage.asp?PageID=4704 |title=Colorado Springs Airport – News Releases |publisher=Springsgov.com |date= |accessdate=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is in the process of expanding its maintenance facilities, taxiways, and runways to accommodate future growth. In 2005 it served approximately two million passengers.&lt;ref name = &quot;oolfhw&quot;/&gt;

===Major highways===
In 2004, the voters of Colorado Springs and El Paso County established the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pprta.com |title=PPRTA Homepage |publisher=Pprta.com |date=September 28, 2009 |accessdate=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted a 1% sales tax dedicated to improving the region's transportation infrastructure. Together with state funding for the Colorado Springs Metro Interstate Expansion (COSMIX)(2007 completion) and the I-25 interchange with Highway 16 (2008 completion), significant progress has been made since 2003 in addressing the transportation needs of the area. Currently the City is trying to overcome a $23.3&amp;nbsp;million budget gap created by falling sales taxes and rising expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Zubeck |first=Pam |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/million_39774___article.html/council_city.htmlCouncil: |title=Cut, don't raise taxes or fees August&amp;nbsp;25, 2008 |publisher=Gazette.com |date=August 16, 2008 |accessdate=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorado Springs is primarily served by the interstate highways [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|I-25]] and [[U.S. Route 24]].
*[[Image:I-25 (CO).svg|25px]] '''[[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]]''' runs north-south from [[New Mexico]] through Colorado Springs to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] on its way northward towards Wyoming. I-25 in El Paso County running through Colorado Springs is known as Ronald Reagan Highway.
*[[Image:US 24.svg|25px]] '''[[US 24]]''' traverses through eastern Colorado from Limon through several towns such as [[Matheson, Colorado|Matheson]], [[Simla, Colorado|Simla]], [[Ramah, Colorado|Ramah]], [[Calhan, Colorado|Calhan]], [[Peyton, Colorado|Peyton]] and [[Falcon, Colorado|Falcon]] until it reaches the city and leaves the city through the mountains on its way to [[Minturn, Colorado|Minturn, CO]].
*[[Image:Colorado 21.svg|25px]] '''[[Colorado State Highway 21|SH 21]]''' is a major east side expressway which begins near [[Black Forest, Colorado|Black Forest]] and ends in [[Security-Widefield, Colorado|Security-Widefield]], also known more widely as '''Powers Boulevard'''.
*[[Image:Colorado 83.svg|25px]] '''[[Colorado State Highway 83|SH 83]]''' runs north-south from [[Denver]] to Colorado Springs.
*[[Image:Colorado 94.svg|25px]] '''[[Colorado State Highway 94|SH 94]]''' runs east-west from western [[Cheyenne County, Colorado|Cheyenne County]] to Colorado Springs.
*[[Image:Colorado 115.svg|25px]] '''[[Colorado State Highway 115|SH 115]]''' begins from the US 50 interchange in [[Cañon City, Colorado|Cañon City]] to [[US 85]] (Nevada Avenue) in the city.
*[[Image:US 85.svg|25px]] '''[[U.S. Route 85|US 85]]''' US 85 enters the city at [[Fountain, Colorado|Fountain]] and is signed as Nevada Avenue until it leaves the city at exit 153.
*[[Image:US 87.svg|25px]] '''[[US 87]]''' US 87 remains concurrent with I-25 throughout Colorado.

In addition, there were plans to develop a &quot;Front Range Toll Road&quot;, a privately-owned [[Toll road|turnpike]], which would begin south of Pueblo and end around Fort Collins. This toll road would allow rail and truck traffic to avoid the more highly traveled parts of I-25 along the Front Range. Initially, the project had support but has since been highly contested because of the need to condemn the land of many private citizens, through the use of [[eminent domain]], to make room for the corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nosuperslab.org/crap/how_to.html |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns and Improvements===
In order to combat congestion the Colorado Department of Transportation widened the [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]] corridor throughout the city from four lanes (two in each direction) to six lanes. Ultimately, the plan is to make the interstate eight lanes through the city when funding becomes available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cosmixproject.com/ |title=Litter Removal Program |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Colorado Department of Transportation’s (CDOT) |accessdate=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan is similar in nature to Denver's T-Rex expansion plan.

Several suggestions have been made to create a loop around the city though none have been implemented. The original plan to convert Powers Boulevard, a major eastside expressway, into a bypass for I-25 was abandoned, although some interchanges are overpasses and roads further east are being looked at.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20061224/ai_n17109195 |title=Powers freeway debate restarts &amp;#124; Gazette, The (Colorado Springs) |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=December 24, 2006 |accessdate=October 5, 2009 | first=Ed | last=Sealover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easier access to the airport has also been suggested. Overall the new thoroughfares would include one (or two) loop freeways, a spur into the city connecting the main freeway and the loop, east-west expressway upgrades, and easier access to the Colorado Springs Airport.

Two grade separated interchanges were built in order to alleviate congestion at some of the city's worst intersections. Both the intersection at Powers and Woodmen and the intersection at Austin Bluffs and Union were converted into grade separated interchanges. A third interchange is being built at the intersection of Woodmen Road and Academy Boulevard and will be complete by 2011.

In early 2010, the city of Colorado Springs approved an expansion of the northernmost part of Powers Boulevard in order to create an Interstate 25 bypass commonly referred to as the Copper Ridge Expansion. The project developers also have hopes of increasing business at the future I-25 Powers Boulevard connection by building a 2.8 million sq. ft. shopping mall on the East side of the Powers exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csindy.com/colorado/for-the-love-of-a-road/Content?oid=2033692 |title=For the love of a road; Colorado Springs Independent, The (Colorado Springs) |publisher=http://www.csindy.com |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=February 9, 2011 | first=Ed | last=Sealover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers hope to have the project finished by 2013, but have a deadline of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csindy.com/colorado/noted/Content?oid=1706080 |title=Copper Ridge takes a step; Colorado Springs Independent, The (Colorado Springs) &amp;#124; Find Articles at http://www.csindy.com |publisher=http://www.csindy.com |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=February 9, 2011 | first=Ed | last=Sealover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sister cities==

[[Sister cities]] of Colorado Springs include:
* [[Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi|Fujiyoshida, Japan]] (1962)
* [[Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung, Taiwan]] (1983)
* [[Smolensk|Smolensk, Russia]] (1993)
* [[Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan]] (1994)
* [[Nuevo Casas Grandes|Nuevo Casas Grandes, Mexico]] (1996)
* [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown, Australia]] (1999)

Colorado Springs' sister city organization began when Colorado Springs became partners with Fujiyoshida. The ''torii'' gate erected to commemorate the relationship stands at the corner of Bijou Street and Nevada Avenue, and is one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. The [[Shinto|''torii'' gate]], crisscrossed bridge and shrine, located in the median between Platte and Bijou Streets in downtown Colorado Springs, were a gift to Colorado Springs, erected in 1966 by the Rotary Club of Colorado Springs to celebrate the friendship between the two communities. A plaque near the ''torii'' gate states that &quot;the purpose of the sister city relationship is to promote understanding between the people of our two countries and cities&quot;. The Fujiyoshida Student exchange program has become an annual event.

To strengthen relations between the two cities, the Colorado Springs Youth Symphony regularly invites the Taiko drummers from the city to participate in a joint concert in the Pikes Peak Center. The orchestra played in Bankstown, Australia, in 2002 and again in June 2006 as part of their tours to Australia and New Zealand.

Also, in 2006 and 2010, the Bankstown TAP (Talent Advancement Program), performed with the Youth Symphony, and the Colorado Springs Children's Chorale, as a part of the annual In Harmony program.

A notable similarity between Colorado Springs and its sister cities are their geographic positions, three of the six cities being located near the base of a major mountain or range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.springsgov.com/Page.asp?NavID=1923 |title=City of Colorado Springs – Topic Pages |publisher=Springsgov.com |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Professional certification''', '''trade certification''', or '''professional designation''', often called simply ''certification'' or ''qualification'', is a designation earned by a person to assure qualification to perform a job or task. Many certifications are used as [[post-nominal letters]] indicating an earned privilege from an oversight [[professional body]] acting to safeguard the public interest.

== Overview ==
Certifications are earned from a [[professional society]] or from a IT vendor (eg. [[Microsoft]], [[Cisco]], etc). In general, must be renewed periodically, or may be valid for a specific period of time (e.g., the lifetime of the product upon which the individual is certified). As a part of a complete renewal of an individual's certification, it is common for the individual to show evidence of continued learning &amp;mdash; often termed [[continuing education]] &amp;mdash; or earning [[continuing education unit]]s (CEU). 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most certification programs are created, sponsored, or affiliated with professional associations, trade organizations, or IT vendors interested in raising standards. Even those programs completely independent from membership organizations enjoy association support and endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of certification programs is also a reaction to the changing employment market. Certifications are portable, since they do not depend on one company's definition of a certain job. Certification stands about the resume and the professional reference by being an impartial, third-party endorsement of an individual's professional knowledge and experience. Certification provides an impartial, third-party endorsement of an individual's professional knowledge and experience.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Barnhart, [http://books.google.com/books?id=3tY8Fck5UVkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20guide%20to%20national%20professional%20certification%20programs&amp;pg=PA2 The Guide to National Professional Certification Programs] (1997), HRD Press. ISBN 0-8493-9960-2 Retrieved electronically 07-07-2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is important to note that certifications are usually earned from a professional society or educational institute, not the government. If a demonstration of ability or knowledge is required ''by law'' before being allowed to perform a task or job, this is referred to as [[licensure]]. In the United States, [[U.S. State professional licenses|professional licenses]] are usually issued by state agencies. The certification assessment process, for some organizations, is very similar or even the same as licensure and may differ only in terms of legal status, while in other organizations, can be quite different and more comprehensive than that of licensure. certification and licensure differ only in terms of legal status.

The [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) , Standard 1100, defines the requirements of meeting the ANSI standard for being a certifying organization. According to ANSI Standard 1100, a professional certifying organization must meet two requirements:
# Deliver an assessment based on industry knowledge, independent from training courses or course providers.
# Grant a time-limited credential to anyone who meets the assessment standards.

Certifications are very common in [[aviation]], [[construction]], [[technology]], environment, and other [[industrial sector]]s, as well as [[health care]], [[business]] and finance. In USA, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] regulates aviator certifications.

The [[National Organization for Competency Assurance]] (NOCA) is a US-based organization that helps certification bodies, primarily in [[health care]] and related fields, by providing them with information on the latest trends and issues of concern to practitioners and organizations focused on certification, obtaining licenses, and human resource development. Many members of the [[Association of Test Publishers]] (ATP) are also certification organizations.

== Types of certifications==
There are three general types of certification.  Listed in order of development level and portability, they are: corporate (internal), product-specific, and profession-wide. 

Corporate, or internal certifications, are made by a [[corporation]] or low-stakes organization for internal purposes. For example, a corporation might require a one-day training course for all sales personnel, after which they receive a certificate. While this certificate has limited portability – to other corporations, for example – it is the most simple to develop.

Product-specific certifications are more involved, and are intended to be referenced to a product across all applications. This approach is very prevalent in the [[information technology]] (IT) industry, where personnel are certified on a version of [[Computer software|software]] or hardware. This type of certification is portable across locations (for example, different corporations that use that software), but not across other products.

The most general type of certification is profession-wide. Certification in the medical profession is often offered by particular specialties. In order to apply professional standards, increase the level of practice, and possibly protect the public (though this is also the domain of [[licensure]]), a professional organization might establish a certification. This is intended to be portable to all places a certified professional might work. Of course, this generalization increases the cost of such a program; the process to establish a legally defensible assessment of an entire profession is very extensive. An example of this is a [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA), which would not be certified for just one corporation or one piece of [[accountancy]] software but for general work in the profession.

==Areas of certification==
=== Accountancy ===
'''[[Accountant]]s''' are the [[accountancy]] and [[financial]] experts that are legally certified in different jurisdictions to work only in public practices, selling advice and services to other individuals and businesses. Today, however, many work within private corporations, financial industry, and government bodies. There are many professional bodies for accountants throughout the world; some of them are legally recognized in their jurisdictions.

=== Aviation ===
'''[[Aviators]]''' (Aviation Pilots) are certified through theoretical and in-flight examinations. Requirements for certifications are quite equal in most countries and regulated by each National Aviation Authority. The existing certificates or pilot licenses are:
* [[PPL]] (Private Pilot License) conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) or JAA ([[Joint Aviation Authorities]])
* CPL ([[Commercial Pilot Licence]]) conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) or JAA ([[Joint Aviation Authorities]])
* ATP ([[Airline Transport Pilot License|Airline Transport Pilot]]) conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) or JAA ([[Joint Aviation Authorities]])

Licensing in these categories require not only examinations but also a minimum of flight hours. All categories are available for Fixed-Wing Aircraft ([[airplanes]]) and Rotatory-Wing Aircraft ([[helicopters]]). Within each category, aviators may also obtain certifications in:
*Instrument Flight Rules ([[Instrument flight rules|IFR]])
*[[:Category:Multi-engine aircraft|Multi-engine aircraft]]
*[[Turbojet]] Engines
*[[Jet Engine]]s
*[[Experimental aircraft]]
*[[Amphibious aircraft]]
*[[Seaplane]]s
Usually, aviators must be certified also in their log books for the type and model of aircraft they are allowed to fly. Currency checks as well as regular medical check-ups with a frequency of 6 months, 12 months, or 36 months, depending on the type of flying permitted, are obligatory. An aviator can fly only if holding:
*A valid pilot license

=== Language education ===
[[English language learning and teaching|TESOL]] is a large field of employment with widely-varying degrees of regulation. Most provision worldwide is through the [[state school]] system of each individual country, and as such the instructors tend to be trained primary- or [[secondary school]] teachers that are [[native speakers]] of the language of their pupils, not English.  Though native speakers of English have been working in non-English speaking countries [[TEFL|in this capacity]] for years, it was not until the last twenty-five years or so that there was any widespread focus on training particularly for this field. Previously, workers in this sort of job were anyone from [[backpacking (travel)|backpacker]]s hoping to earn some extra travel money to well-educated professionals in other fields doing [[volunteer]] work, or retired people. These sort of people are certainly still to be found, but there are many who consider TESOL their main profession.

One of the problems facing these full-time teachers is the absence of international governing body for the certification or licenture of English language teachers. However, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] and its subsidiary body [[UCLES]] are pioneers in trying to get some degree of accountability and quality control to consumers of English courses, through their [[CELTA]] and [[DELTA (ELT)|DELTA]] programs. [[Trinity College London|Trinity College, London]] has roughly equivalent programs, the [[CertTESOL]] and the [[LTCL DipTESOL]]. They offer initial certificates in teaching, in which candidates are trained in [[language]] awareness and [[classroom]] techniques, and given a chance to practice teaching, after which feedback is reported. Both institutions have as a follow-up a professional diploma, usually taken after a year or two in the field. Although the initial certificate is available to anyone with a high school education, the diploma is meant to be a post-graduate qualification and in fact can be incorporated into a Master's degree program.

=== Legal affairs ===
An increasing number of [[lawyer]]s are choosing to be recognized as having special knowledge and experience by becoming certified specialists in certain fields of law. According to the [[American Bar Association]], a lawyer that is a certified specialist has been recognized by an independent professional certifying organization as having an enhanced level of skill and expertise, as well as substantial involvement in an established legal specialty. These organizations require a lawyer to demonstrate special training, experience and knowledge to ensure that the lawyer's recognition as a certified specialist is meaningful and reliable. Lawyer conduct with regard to specialty certification is regulated by the states.

=== Medicine ===
[[Board certification]] is the process by which a physician in the United States documents by written, practical and/or computer based testing, illustrating a mastery of knowledge and skills that define a particular area of medical specialization. The [[American Board of Medical Specialties]], a not-for-profit organization, assists 24 approved medical specialty boards in the development and use of standards in the ongoing evaluation and certification of physicians.

Medical specialty certification in the United States is a voluntary process. While medical licensure sets the minimum competency requirements to diagnose and treat patients, it is not specialty specific.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abms.org/about_board_certification/means.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;Board certification demonstrate a physician’s exceptional expertise in a particular specialty and/or sub-specialty of medical practice.

Patients, physicians, health care providers, insurers and quality organizations regard certification as an important measure of a physician’s knowledge, experience and skills to provide quality health care within a given specialty.

== Criticisms ==
;Computer technologies
The current proliferation of IT certifications (both offered and attained){{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}, like the [[Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik|FSI]]'s [[IT baseline protection]] certification, has led some technologists to question their value. Proprietary content that has been distributed on the Internet allows some to gain credentials without the implied depth or breadth of expertise. Certifying agencies have responded in various ways: Some now incorporate hands-on elements, anti-cheating methodologies or have expanded their content. Others have expired and restructured their certificate programs, and/or raised their fees to deter abuse.

Certification programs that take into account length of service, and demonstrated experience, via industry peer and/or employer recommendation avoid some of the issues associated with purely passing an examinations; however, certification remains a contentious issue.

Also, some professional certifications require a criminal record check for the certification to be approved.  The presence of a criminal history when applying for certification may be grounds for denial of certification.

'''Carl Menger''' (February 28, 1840 &amp;ndash; February 26, 1921) was the founder of the [[Austrian School of economics]], famous for contributing to the development of the theory of [[marginal utility]], which contested the cost-of-production theories of value, developed by the [[classical economics|classical economists]] such as [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]].

== Biography ==

Menger was born in [[Nowy Sącz]] in [[Austria]]n [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], (now in [[Poland]]). He was the son of a wealthy family of minor nobility; his father, Anton, was a lawyer. His mother, Caroline, was the daughter of a wealthy [[Bohemian]] merchant.  He had two brothers, Anton and Max, both prominent as lawyers.  After attending ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' he studied law at the Universities of [[Prague]] and [[Vienna]] and later received a doctorate in jurisprudence from the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]]. In the 1860s Menger left school and enjoyed a stint as a [[journalist]] reporting and analyzing market news, first at the ''Lemberger Zeitung'' in [[Lwów]], [[Ukraine]] and later at the ''Wiener Zeitung'' in [[Vienna]].

During the course of his newspaper work he noticed a discrepancy between what the [[classical economics]] he was taught in school said about [[price|price determination]] and what real world market participants believed. In 1867 Menger began a study of [[political economy]] which culminated in 1871 with the publication of his ''[[Principles of Economics]]'' ''(Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre),'' thus becoming the father of the [[Austrian School]] of economic thought. It was in this work that he challenged classical cost-based theories of value with his theory of marginality.

In 1872 Menger was enrolled into the law faculty at the [[University of Vienna]] and spent the next several years teaching finance and [[political economy]] both in seminars and lectures to a growing number of students. In 1873 he received the university's chair of economic theory at the very young age of 33.

In 1876 Menger began tutoring Archduke [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria|Rudolf von Habsburg]], the Crown Prince of [[Austria]] in political economy and [[statistics]]. For three years Menger accompanied the prince in his travels, first through continental Europe and then later through the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Economic Thought: A Reader&lt;/ref&gt; He is also thought to have assisted the crown prince in the composition of a pamphlet, published anonymously in 1878, which was highly critical of the higher Austrian aristocracy. His association with the prince would last until Rudolf's suicide in 1889 (see the [[The Mayerling Incident|Mayerling]] Affair).

In 1878 Rudolf's father, Emperor [[Franz Josef of Austria|Franz Josef]], appointed Menger to the chair of political economy at [[Vienna]]. The title of ''Hofrat'' was conferred on him, and he was appointed to the Austrian ''Herrenhaus'' in 1900.

Ensconced in his professorship he set about refining and defending the positions he took and methods he utilized in ''Principles,'' the result of which was the 1883 publication of ''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics (Untersuchungen über die Methode der Socialwissenschaften und der politischen Oekonomie insbesondere).'' The book caused a firestorm of debate, during which members of the [[Historical school of economics]] began to derisively call Menger and his students the &quot;[[Austrian School]]&quot; to emphasize their departure from mainstream economic thought in [[Germany]] – the term was specifically used in an unfavorable review by [[Gustav von Schmoller]]. In 1884 Menger responded with the pamphlet ''The Errors of Historicism in German Economics'' and launched the infamous ''[[Methodenstreit]],'' or methodological debate, between the Historical School and the [[Austrian School]]. During this time Menger began to attract like-minded disciples who would go on to make their own mark on the field of [[economics]], most notably  [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], and [[Friedrich von Wieser]].

In the late 1880s Menger was appointed to head a commission to reform the [[Austria]]n monetary system. Over the course of the next decade he authored a plethora of articles which would revolutionize [[monetary theory]], including &quot;The Theory of Capital&quot; (1888) and &quot;Money&quot; (1892).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;On the Origin of Money&quot; (English translation by Caroline A. Foley), ''Economic Journal'', Volume 2 (1892), pp. 239-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Largely due to his pessimism about the state of German scholarship, Menger resigned his professorship in 1903 to concentrate on study.

'''Civilization''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29|or]] '''civilisation''') is a sometimes controversial term that has been used in several related ways. Primarily, the term has been used to refer to human [[culture]]s that are complex in terms of [[technology]], [[science]], and [[division of labor]]. Such civilizations are generally [[cities|urbanized]]. In classical contexts civilized peoples were called this in contrast to &quot;barbarian&quot; peoples, while in modern contexts civilized peoples have been contrasted to &quot;primitive&quot; peoples. 

In modern academic discussions however, there is a tendency to use the term in a less strict way to mean approximately the same thing as &quot;[[culture]]&quot; and can therefore refer more broadly to any important and clearly defined human society, particularly in historical discussions. Still, even when used in this second sense, the word is often restricted to apply only to societies that have attained a particular level of advancement, especially the founding of cities, with the word &quot;city&quot; defined in various ways. 

The level of advancement of a civilization is often measured by its progress in agriculture, long-distance trade, [[division of labor|occupational specialization]], and [[urbanism]]. Aside from these core elements, civilization is often marked by any combination of a number of secondary elements, including a developed [[transportation]] system, [[writing]], standards of measurement (currency, etc.), [[contract]] and [[tort]]-based [[law|legal]] systems, characteristic [[art]] styles (which may pertain to specific cultures), monumental [[architecture]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], sophisticated [[metallurgy]], [[politics]], and [[astronomy]].

==Definition==
The word ''civilization'' comes from the Latin ''civilis'', meaning ''civil'', related to the Latin ''civis'', meaning ''citizen'', and ''civitas'', meaning ''city'' or ''city-state''.

[[image:Mohenjodaro Sindh.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|The ancient city of [[Mohenjo-daro]] of the Ancient [[Indus valley civilization]], spanning [[India]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] is known to be one of the world's earliest [[cities]].]]
In the sixth century, the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] [[Emperor Justinian]] oversaw the consolidation of Roman [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. The resulting collection is called the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. In the 11th century, professors at the [[Bologna|University of Bologna]], [[Western Europe]]'s first [[university]], rediscovered the ''Corpus Juris Civilis'', and its influence began to be felt across bodies. In 1388, the word ''civil'' appeared in English meaning &quot;of or related to citizens.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Civil&quot;, ''Merriam-Webster'', 226.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1704, ''civilization'' was used to mean &quot;a law which makes a criminal process into a civil case.&quot; ''Civilization'' was not used in its modern sense to mean &quot;the opposite of [[barbarian|barbarism]]&quot; — as contrasted to ''civility'', meaning politeness or civil virtue — until the second half of the 18th century.

According to [[Emile Benveniste]] (1954&lt;ref name=Benveniste&gt;[[Émile Benveniste]], &quot;''Civilisation. Contribution à l'histoire du mot''&quot; (Civilisation. Contribution to the history of the word), 1954, published in ''Problèmes de linguistique générale'', [[Editions Gallimard]], 1966, pp.336-345 (translated by Mary Elizabeth Meek as ''Problems in general linguistics'', 2 vols., 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;), the earliest written occurrence in English of ''civilisation'' in its modern sense may be found in [[Adam Ferguson]]'s ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (Edinburgh, 1767 - p.&amp;nbsp;2): &quot;Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood, but the species itself from rudeness to civilisation.&quot; &lt;!-- keep original spelling please --&gt;

It should be noted that this usage incorporates the concept of superiority and maturity of &quot;civilized&quot; existence, as contrasted to &quot;rudeness&quot;, which is used to denote coarseness, as in a lack of refinement or &quot;civility.&quot;

[[File:Clash of Civilizations mapn2.png|400px|thumb|[[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington]]'s map of world civilizations (1996).]]
Before Benveniste's inquiries, the [[New English Dictionary]] quoted [[James Boswell]]'s conversation with [[Samuel Johnson]] concerning the inclusion of ''Civilization'' &lt;!-- keep original spelling please --&gt; in Johnson's dictionary:
{{quote|On Monday, March 23 (1772), I found him busy, preparing a fourth edition of his folio Dictionary... He would not admit ''civilization'', but only ''civility''. With great deference to him I thought ''civilization'', from ''to civilize'', better in the sense opposed to ''barbarity'' than ''civility'', as it is better to have a distinct word for each sense, than one word with two senses, which ''civility'' is, in his way of using it.}}

Benveniste demonstrated that previous occurrences could be found, which explained the quick adoption of Johnson's definition. In 1775 the dictionary of Ast defined ''civilization'' as &quot;the state of being civilized; the act of civilizing&quot;,&lt;ref name=Benveniste/&gt; and the term was frequently used by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776).&lt;ref name=Benveniste/&gt; Beside Smith and Ferguson, John Millar also used it in 1771 in his ''Observations concerning the distinction of ranks in society''.&lt;ref name=Benveniste/&gt;

The history of the word in English appears to be connected with the parallel development in French, which may be the original source. As the first occurrence of ''civilization'' in French was found by Benveniste in the [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Marquis de Mirabeau's]] ''L'Ami des hommes ou traité de la population'' (written in 1756 but published in 1757), Benveniste's query was to know if the English word derived from the French, or if both evolved independently — a question which needed more research. According to him, the word ''civilization'' may in fact have been used by Ferguson as soon as 1759.&lt;ref name=Benveniste/&gt;

Furthermore, Benveniste notes that, contrasted to ''civility'', a static term, ''civilization'' conveys a sense of dynamism. He thus writes that:
{{quote|It was not only a historical view of society; it was also an optimist and resolutely non theological interpretation of its evolution which asserted itself, sometimes at the insu of those who proclaimed it, and even if some of them, and first of all Mirabeau, still counted religion as the first factor of 'civilization''.&lt;ref name=Benveniste/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benveniste (French): ''Ce n'était pas seulement une vue historique de la société; c'était aussi une interprétation optimiste et résolument non théologique de son évolution qui s'affirmait, parfois à l'insu de ceux qui la proclamaient, et même si certains, et d'abord Mirabeau, comptaient encore la religion comme le premier facteur de la &quot;civilization&quot;.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the late 1700s and early 1800s, both during the [[French revolution]], and in English, &quot;civilization&quot; was referred to in the [[Grammatical number|singular]], never the plural, because it referred to the progress of mankind as a whole. This is still the case in French.&lt;ref name=velkley/&gt; More recently &quot;civilizations&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for the broader term &quot;cultures&quot; in both popular and academic circles.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Civilization&quot; (1974), ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]'' 15th ed. Vol. II, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., 956. Retrieved 25 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concepts of civilization and culture are not always considered interchangeable. For example, a small nomadic tribe may be judged not to have a civilization, but it would surely be judged to have a culture (defined as &quot;the arts, customs, habits... beliefs, values, behavior and material habits that constitute a people's way of life&quot;). 

Civilization is not always seen as an improvement. One historically important distinction between culture and civilization stems from the writings of [[Rousseau]], and particularly his work concerning [[education]], ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Emile]]''. In this perspective, civilization, being more [[rational]] and socially driven, is not fully in accordance with [[human nature]], and &quot;human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original prediscursive or prerational natural unity&quot;. (See [[noble savage]].) From this notion, a new approach was developed especially in Germany, first by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], and later by philosophers such as [[Nietzsche]]. This sees cultures (plural) as natural organisms which are not defined by &quot;conscious, rational, deliberative acts&quot; but rather a kind of pre-rational &quot;folk spirit&quot;. Civilization, in contrast, though more rational and more successful concerning material progress, is seen as un-natural, and leads to &quot;vices of social life&quot; such as guile, hypocrisy, envy, and avarice.&lt;ref name=velkley&gt;{{Citation|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question| last=Velkley|first=Richard|year=2002|chapter=The Tension in the Beautiful: On Culture and Civilization in Rousseau and German Philosophy|pages=11–30|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], [[Leo Strauss]], having fled Germany, argued in New York that this approach to civilization was behind [[Nazism]] and German [[militarism]] and [[nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.archive.org/details/LeoStraussOnGermanNihilism1941 On German Nihilism]&quot; (1999, originally a 1941 lecture), ''Interpretation'' 26, no. 3 edited by David Janssens and Daniel Tanguay.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Philosophy of Civilization'', [[Albert Schweitzer]] outlined the idea that there are dual opinions within society: one regarding civilization as purely [[materialism|material]] and another regarding civilization as both [[ethic]]al and material. He stated that the current world crisis was, then in 1923, due to a humanity having lost the ethical conception of civilization. In this same work, he defined civilization, saying that it &quot;is the sum total of all progress made by man in every sphere of action and from every point of view in so far as the progress helps towards the spiritual perfecting of individuals as the progress of all progress.&quot;

Social scientists such as [[V. Gordon Childe]] have named a number of traits that distinguish a civilization from other kinds of society.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Childe, V., ''What Happened in History'' (Penguin, 1942) and ''Man Makes Himself'' (Harmondsworth, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of livelihood, settlement patterns, forms of government, social stratification, economic systems, [[literacy]], and other cultural traits.

All civilizations have depended on [[agriculture]] for subsistence. Growing food on farms results in a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as [[irrigation]] and [[crop rotation]]. [[Grain]] surpluses have been especially important because they can be [[food storage|stored]] for a long time. A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides produce food for a living: early civilizations included [[artisan]]s, [[priest]]s and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A surplus of food results in a division of labor and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and perhaps during the [[Mesolithic]] [[Natufian culture]]. It is possible that food surpluses and relatively large scale social organization and division of labor predates plant and animal domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/gobekli-tepe/mann-text/1 |title= Göbekli Tepe |publisher= [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |accessdate= 18 Mat 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilizations have distinctly different settlement patterns from other societies. The word ''civilization'' is sometimes simply defined as &quot;'living in cities'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Standage]] (2005), ''A History of the World in 6 Glasses'', Walker &amp; Company, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-farmers tend to gather in cities to work and to trade.

Compared with other societies, civilizations have a more complex political structure, namely the [[State (polity)|state]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. State societies are more stratified{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} than other societies; there is a greater difference among the social classes. The [[ruling class]], normally concentrated in the cities, has control over much of the surplus and exercises its will through the actions of a [[government]] or [[bureaucracy]]. [[Morton Fried]], a [[conflict theory|conflict theorist]], and [[Elman Service]], an integration theorist, have classified human cultures based on political systems and [[social inequality]]. This system of classification contains four categories:{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
* ''[[Hunter-gatherer]] bands'', which are generally [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
* ''[[horticulture|Horticultural]]/[[Pastoralism|pastoral]] societies'' in which there are generally two inherited social classes; chief and commoner.
* ''Highly stratified structures'', or [[chiefdom]]s, with several inherited social classes: king, noble, freemen, serf and slave.

Economically, civilizations display more complex patterns of ownership and exchange than less organized societies. Living in one place allows people to accumulate more [[Ownership|personal possessions]] than nomadic people. Some people also acquire [[landed property]], or private ownership of the land. Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their own food, they must [[trade]] their goods and services for food in a [[market]] system, or receive food through the levy of [[tribute]], redistributive [[taxation]], [[tariffs]] or [[tithe]]s from the food producing segment of the population. Early civilizations developed [[money]] as a medium of exchange for these increasingly complex transactions. To oversimplify, in a village the potter makes a pot for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a certain amount of beer. In a city, the potter may need a new roof, the roofer may need new shoes, the cobbler may need new horseshoes, the blacksmith may need a new coat, and the tanner may need a new pot. These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time. A monetary system is a way of organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled fairly.

[[Writing]], developed first by people in [[Sumer]], is considered a hallmark of civilization and &quot;appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Pauketat|Pauketat, Timothy R.]] 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records. Like money, writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other.

Aided by their division of labor and central government planning, civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits. These include organized [[religion]], development in the [[arts]], and countless new advances in [[science]] and [[technology]].

Through history, successful civilizations have spread, taking over more and more territory, and assimilating more and more previously-uncivilized people. Nevertheless, some tribes or people remain uncivilized even to this day. These cultures are called by some &quot;[[primitive culture|primitive]],&quot; a term that is regarded by others as pejorative. &quot;Primitive&quot; implies in some way that a culture is &quot;first&quot; (Latin = primus), that it has not changed since the dawn of mankind, though this has been demonstrated not to be true.  Specifically, as all of today's cultures are contemporaries, today's so-called primitive cultures are in no way antecedent to those we consider civilized. Many anthropologists use the term &quot;[[Protohistoric archaeology|non-literate]]&quot; to describe these peoples. In the USA and Canada, where many people of such cultures were displaced by European settlers, the term &quot;[[First Nations]]&quot; is used. Generally, the First Nations of North America had hierarchical governments, religion, a barter system, and oral transmission of their traditions, cultures, laws, etc. Respect for the wisdom of elders and for their natural environment{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} (7th Generation decision-making) sustained these cultures for over 10,000 years.

Civilization has been spread by [[colonization]], [[imperialism|invasion]], [[religious conversion]], the extension of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic control]] and [[trade]], and by introducing agriculture and writing to non-literate peoples. Some non-civilized people may willingly adapt to civilized behaviour. But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders.

==Cultural identity==
&lt;!-- [[File:Persepolis iran.jpg;The king of Holy Kingdon Rum kneel of the king of persian]] comment to remove redlinked img--&gt;
&quot;Civilization&quot; can also refer to the [[culture]] of a complex society, not just the society itself. Every society, civilization or not, has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique. Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including literature, professional art, architecture, organized religion, and complex customs associated with the elite. 

The intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to spread to and influence other cultures, sometimes assimilating them into the civilization (a classic example being [[China|Chinese]] civilization and its influence on nearby civilizations such as [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]]). Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres containing many nations and regions. The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.

Many historians have focused on these broad cultural spheres and have treated civilizations as discrete units. One example is early twentieth-century philosopher [[Oswald Spengler]],&lt;ref&gt;Spengler, Oswald, ''Decline of the West: Perspectives of World History'' (1919)&lt;/ref&gt; even though he uses the German word &quot;Kultur,&quot; &quot;culture,&quot; for what we here call a &quot;civilization.&quot; He said that a civilization's coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol. Civilizations experience cycles of birth, life, decline, and death, often supplanted by a new civilization with a potent new culture, formed around a compelling new cultural symbol.

This &quot;unified culture&quot; concept of civilization also influenced the theories of historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in the mid-twentieth century. Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multi-volume ''[[A Study of History]],'' which traced the rise and, in most cases, the decline of 21 civilizations and five &quot;arrested civilizations.&quot; Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a &quot;creative minority&quot;, through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes.

[[Samuel P. Huntington]] similarly defines a civilization as &quot;the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species.&quot; Besides giving a definition of a civilization, Huntington has also proposed several theories about civilizations, discussed [[Civilization#Future|below]].

==Complex systems==
Another group of theorists, making use of [[systems theory]], looks at a civilization as a [[complex system]], i.e., a framework by which a group of objects can be analyzed that work in concert to produce some result. Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures, and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social, and cultural interactions among them. Any organization is a complex [[social system]], and a civilization is a large organization. Systems theory helps guard against superficial but misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations.

Systems theorists look at many types of relations between cities, including economic relations, cultural exchanges, and political/diplomatic/military relations. These spheres often occur on different scales. For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres. Extensive trade routes, including the [[Silk Road]] through [[Central Asia]] and [[Indian Ocean]] sea routes linking the [[Roman Empire]], [[Persian Empire]], [[India]], and [[China]], were well established 2000 years ago, when these civilizations scarcely shared any political, diplomatic, military, or cultural relations. The first evidence of such long distance trade is in the ancient world. During the Uruk phase Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Algaze, Guillermo, ''The Uruk World System: The Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilization''&quot; (Second Edition, 2004) (ISBN 978-0-226-01382-4)&lt;/ref&gt; Resin found later in the [http://www.mesopotamia.co.uk/tombs/index.html Royal Tombs of Ur] it is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique.

Many theorists argue that the entire world has already become integrated into a single &quot;[[world-system theory|world system]]&quot;, a process known as [[globalization]]. Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways. There is debate over when this integration began, and what sort of integration – cultural, technological, economic, political, or military-diplomatic – is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization. David Wilkinson has proposed that economic and military-diplomatic integration of the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the &quot;Central Civilization&quot; around 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, David, ''[http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol10/number3/pdf/jwsr-v10n3-wilkinson.pdf The Power Configuration Sequence of the Central World System, 1500-700 BC]'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe , and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century. According to Wilkinson, civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous, like the Central Civilization, or homogeneous, like the Japanese civilization. What Huntington calls the &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; might be characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a single global civilization. Others point to the [[Crusades]] as the first step in globalization. The more conventional viewpoint is that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since ancient times, and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product of recent European colonialism.

Political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]]&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Samuel P., ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'', (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that the defining characteristic of the 21st century will be a [[clash of civilizations]]. According to Huntington, conflicts between civilizations will supplant the conflicts between [[nation-state]]s and ideologies that characterized the 19th and 20th centuries. These views have been strongly challenged by others like [[Edward Said]], Muhammed Asadi and [[Amartya Sen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selvesandothers.org/article15618.html|title=A Critique of Huntington’s &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot;|last=Asadi|first=Muhammed|date=2007-01-22|publisher=Selves and Others|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Pippa Norris]] have argued that the &quot;true clash of civilizations&quot; between the Muslim world and the West is caused by the Muslim rejection of the West's more liberal sexual values, rather than a difference in political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/2003/0304clash.htm|title=The True Clash of Civilizations|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|coauthors=Pippa Norris|date=March/April 2003|publisher=Global Policy Forum|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Identity and Violence]]'' Sen questions if people should be divided along the lines of a supposed 'civilization', defined by religion and culture only. He argues that this ignores the many others identities that make up people and leads to a focus on differences.

Some environmental scientists see the world entering a [[Planetary Phase of Civilization]], characterized by a shift away from independent, disconnected nation-states to a world of increased global connectivity with worldwide institutions, environmental challenges, economic systems, and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionsociety.org/pages/oo/sidebars/America/Rockefeller.html Orion &gt; Thoughts on America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmosjournal.org/kjo/backissue/s2006/laszlo-1.shtml Kosmos Journal Paths to Planetary Civilization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to better understand what a Planetary Phase of Civilization might look like in the current context of declining natural resources and increasing consumption, the [[Global scenario group]] used [[scenario analysis]] to arrive at three archetypal futures: Barbarization, in which increasing conflicts result in either a fortress world or complete societal breakdown; Conventional Worlds, in which market forces or [[Policy reform]] slowly precipitate more sustainable practices; and a Great Transition, in which either the sum of fragmented [[Eco-Communalism]] movements add up to a sustainable world or globally coordinated efforts and initiatives result in a new [[sustainability]] paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/Great_Transitions.pdf GTinitiative.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Derrick Jensen]] argues that modern civilization is intrinsically directed towards the domination of the environment and humanity itself in a harmful and destructive fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick (2006), &quot;Endgame: The Problem of Civilisation&quot;, Vol 1 &amp; Vol 2 (Seven Stories Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kardashev scale]] classifies civilizations based on their level of technological advancement, specifically measured by the amount of energy a civilization is able to harness. The Kardashev scale makes provisions for civilizations far more technologically advanced than any currently known to exist ''(see also: [[Civilizations and the Future]], [[Space civilization]])''.

==Fall of civilizations==
{{Main|Societal collapse}}

There have been many explanations put forward for the collapse of civilization. Some focus on historical examples, and others on general theory.

*'''[[Edward Gibbon|Edward Gibbon's]]''' work ''&quot;[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]&quot;'' was a well-known and detailed analysis of the fall of Roman civilization. Gibbon suggested the final act of the collapse of Rome was the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453 AD. For Gibbon:-&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the cause of the destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. The story of the ruin is simple and obvious; and instead of inquiring why the Roman Empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it has subsisted for so long.&quot;''[Gibbon, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 2nd ed., vol. 4, ed. by J. B. Bury (London, 1909), pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174.-Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.--Part VI. General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* '''[[Theodor Mommsen]]''' in his ''&quot;[[History of Rome (Mommsen)]]&quot;,'' suggested Rome collapsed with the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD and he also tended towards a biological analogy of &quot;genesis,&quot; &quot;growth,&quot; &quot;senescence,&quot; &quot;collapse&quot; and &quot;decay.&quot;
* '''[[Oswald Spengler]]''', in his ''&quot;[[Decline of the West]]&quot;'' rejected [[Petrarch]]'s chronological division, and suggested that there had been only eight &quot;mature civilizations.&quot; Growing cultures, he argued, tend to develop into imperialistic civilizations which expand and ultimately collapse, with democratic forms of government ushering in [[plutocracy]] and ultimately [[imperialism]].
* '''[[Arnold J. Toynbee]]''' in his ''&quot;[[A Study of History]]&quot;'' suggested that there had been a much larger number of civilizations, including a small number of [[arrested civilizations]], and that all civilizations tended to go through the cycle identified by Mommsen. The cause of the fall of a civilization occurred when a [[cultural elite]] became a [[parasitic elite]], leading to the rise of internal and external [[proletariat]]s.
* '''[[Joseph Tainter]]''' in ''&quot;[[Societal collapse|The Collapse of Complex Societies]]&quot;'' suggested that there were [[diminishing returns]] to [[complexity]], due to which, as states achieved a maximum permissible complexity, they would decline when further increases actually produced a negative return. Tainter suggested that Rome achieved this figure in the 2nd Century AD.
* '''[[Jared Diamond]]''' in his 2005 book ''&quot;[[Collapse (book)|Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]&quot;'' suggests five major reasons for the collapse of 41 studied cultures: environmental damage, such as [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]]; [[climate change]]; dependence upon [[international trade|long-distance trade]] for needed resources; increasing levels of internal and external violence, such as war or invasion; and societal responses to internal and environmental problems.
* '''[[Peter Turchin]]''' in his [http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/faculty/turchin/HistDyn.htm ''Historical Dynamics''] and '''[[Andrey Korotayev]]''' ''et al.'' in their [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=172&amp;Itemid=70 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics, Secular Cycles, and Millennial Trends''] suggest a number of mathematical models describing collapse of agrarian civilizations. For example, the basic logic of Turchin's &quot;fiscal-demographic&quot; model can be outlined as follows: during the initial phase of a sociodemographic [[Social cycle theory|cycle]] we observe relatively high levels of per capita production and consumption, which leads not only to relatively high [[population growth]] rates, but also to relatively high rates of surplus production. As a result, during this phase the population can afford to pay taxes without great problems, the taxes are quite easily collectible, and the population growth is accompanied by the growth of state revenues. During the intermediate phase, the increasing [[overpopulation]] leads to the decrease of per capita production and consumption levels, it becomes more and more difficult to collect taxes, and state revenues stop growing, whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the population controlled by the state. As a result, during this phase the state starts experiencing considerable fiscal problems. During the final pre-collapse phases the overpopulation leads to further decrease of per capita production, the surplus production further decreases, state revenues shrink, but the state needs more and more resources to control the growing (though with lower and lower rates) population. Eventually this leads to famines, epidemics, state breakdown, and demographic and civilization collapse (Peter Turchin. ''Historical Dynamics.'' [[Princeton University Press]], 2003:121–127).
* '''[[Peter Heather]]''' argues in his book [[Decline of the Roman Empire#Peter Heather|''The Fall of the Roman Empire: a New History of Rome and the Barbarians'']]&lt;ref&gt;ISBN 0-19-515954-3&lt;/ref&gt; that this civilization did not end for moral or economic reasons, but because centuries of contact with barbarians across the frontier generated its own nemesis by making them a much more sophisticated and dangerous adversary. The fact that Rome needed to generate ever greater revenues to equip and re-equip armies that were for the first time repeatedly defeated in the field, led to the dismemberment of the Empire. Although this argument is specific to Rome, it can also be applied to the Asiatic Empire of the Egyptians, to the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasties of China, to the Muslim [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and others.
* '''[[Bryan Ward-Perkins]]''', in his book ''[[The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization]]'',&lt;ref&gt;ISBN 0-19-280728-5&lt;/ref&gt; shows the real horrors associated with the collapse of a civilization for the people who suffer its effects, unlike many revisionist historians who downplay this. The collapse of complex society meant that even basic plumbing disappeared from the continent for 1,000 years. Similar [[Greek dark ages|Dark Age]] collapses are seen with the Late [[Bronze Age collapse]] in the Eastern Mediterranean, the collapse of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], on [[Easter Island]] and elsewhere.
* '''[[Arthur Demarest]]''' argues in ''[[Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization]]'',&lt;ref&gt;ISBN 0-521-53390-2&lt;/ref&gt; using a holistic perspective to the most recent evidence from archaeology, [[paleoecology]], and epigraphy, that no one explanation is sufficient but that a series of erratic, complex events, including loss of soil fertility, drought and rising levels of internal and external violence led to the disintegration of the courts of Mayan kingdoms which began a spiral of decline and decay. He argues that the collapse of the Maya has lessons for civilization today.
* '''Jeffrey A. McNeely''' has recently suggested that &quot;A review of historical evidence shows that past civilizations have tended to [[over-exploit]] their forests, and that such abuse of important resources has been a significant factor in the decline of the over-exploiting society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McNeely, Jeffrey A. (1994) &quot;Lessons of the past: Forests and Biodiversity&quot; (Vol 3, No 1 1994. Biodiversity and Conservation)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Thomas Homer-Dixon]]''' in &quot;[http://www.theupsideofdown.com ''The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity, and the Renewal of Civilization'']&quot;, considers that the fall in the [[EROEI|energy return on investments]]; the energy expended to energy yield ratio, is central to limiting the survival of civilizations. The degree of social complexity is associated strongly, he suggests, with the amount of disposable energy environmental, economic and technological systems allow. When this amount decreases civilizations either have to access new energy sources or they will collapse....

{{see|Old World|Axial age}}
[[Karl Jaspers]], the German historical philosopher, proposed that the ancient civilizations were affected greatly by an [[Axial Age]] in the period between 800 BC-200 BC during which a series of male sages, prophets, religious reformers and philosophers, from China, India, Iran, Israel and Greece, changed the direction of civilizations forever.&lt;ref&gt;Tarnas, Richard (1993) &quot;The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View&quot; (Ballatine Books)&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[William H. McNeill]] proposed that this period of history was one in which culture contact between previously separate civilizations saw the &quot;closure of the [[oecumene]]&quot;, and led to accelerated social change from China to the Mediterranean, associated with the spread of coinage, larger empires and new religions. This view has recently been championed by Christopher Chase-Dunn and other [[world systems theory|world systems theorists]].

'''''Sid Meier's Civilization''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] &quot;[[4X]]&quot;-type [[strategy video game]] created by [[Sid Meier]] for [[Microprose Software|MicroProse]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civfanatics.com/civ1/index.php Civilization 1 Fanatics' Site]&lt;/ref&gt; The game's objective is to &quot;Build an empire to stand the test of time&quot;: it begins in [[4th millennium BC|4000 BC]] and the players attempt to expand and develop their empires through the ages from the ancient era until modern and near-future times. It is also known simply as ''Civilization'', or abbreviated to ''Civ'' or ''Civ I''.

''Civilization'' was originally developed for [[DOS]] running on a [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]. It has undergone numerous revisions for various platforms (including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Macintosh]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[N-Gage]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]]) and now exists in several versions. The N-Gage version was the [[List of last games released on video game consoles#Released in North America|last game]] released for the system in [[North America]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:CivilizationAmigaAGA.png|thumb|left|A world map screenshot from the [[Amiga]] version of ''Civilization'']]

''Civilization'' is a turn-based single-player strategy game. The player takes on the role of the ruler of a [[civilization]], starting with only one settler unit, and attempts to build an [[empire]] in competition with between two and six other civilizations. The game requires a fair amount of [[micromanagement (gameplay)|micromanagement]] (although less than any of the [[simulation game]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civfanatics.com/civ1/manual/civ1_man.htm#2a Civilization manual at Civ Fanatics]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the larger tasks of [[exploration]], [[warfare]] and [[diplomacy]], the player has to make decisions about where to build new cities, which improvements or units to build in each city, which advances in knowledge should be sought (and at what rate), and how to transform the land surrounding the cities for maximum benefit. From time to time the player's towns may be harassed by [[barbarian]]s, units with no specific nationality and no named leader. These threats only come from unclaimed land or sea, so that over time there are fewer and fewer places from which barbarians will emanate.

[[Image:Civ01.png|thumb|left|Conducting negotiations with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] of the Russians (in Macintosh version)]]

Before the game begins, the player chooses which historical civilization to play. In contrast to later games in the ''Civilization'' series, in ''Civ I'', this is largely a cosmetic choice, affecting titles, city names, musical heralds, color, and also their starting position on the &quot;Play on Earth&quot; map (and thus different resources in one's initial cities). It has no effect on starting position, however, when starting a random world game or a customized world game. The player's choice of civilization also prevents the computer from being able to play as that civilization or the other civilization of the same color, and since computer-controlled opponents display certain traits of their civilizations this affects gameplay as well. The [[Aztec]]s are both fiercely expansionistic and generally extremely wealthy, for example. Other civilizations include the [[United States|Americans]], the [[Mongols]], and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Each civilization is led by a famous historical figure, such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]] for [[India]]ns.

The scope of the game is huge — larger than most other computer games. The game begins in [[4th millennium BC|4000 BC]], before the [[Bronze Age]], and can last through to 2100 AD (on the easiest setting) with [[Space Age]] and &quot;future technologies&quot;. At the start of the game there are no cities anywhere in the world: the player controls one or two settler units, which can be used to found new cities in appropriate sites (and those cities may build other settler units, which can go out and found new cities, thus expanding the empire). Settlers can also alter terrain, build improvements such as mines and [[irrigation]], build roads to connect cities, and later in the game they can construct railroads which offer unlimited movement.

[[Image:Civ02.png|thumb|Choosing technology to research (Macintosh version)]]

As time advances, new technologies are developed; these technologies are the primary way in which the game changes and grows. At the start, players choose from advances such as [[pottery]], the [[wheel]], and the [[alphabet]] to, near the end of the game, [[nuclear fission]] and [[spaceflight]]. Players can gain a large advantage if their civilization is the first to learn a particular technology (the secrets of flight, for example) and put it to use in a military or other context. Most advances give access to new units, city improvements or derivative technologies: for example, the [[chariot]] unit becomes available after the wheel is developed, and the [[granary]] building becomes available to build after pottery is developed. The whole system of advancements from beginning to end is called the [[technology tree]], or simply the Tech tree; this concept has been adopted in many other strategy games. Since only one tech may be &quot;researched&quot; at any given time, the order in which technologies are chosen makes a considerable difference in the outcome of the game and generally reflects the player's preferred style of gameplay.

Players can also build ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' in each of the epochs of the game, subject only to obtaining the prerequisite knowledge. These wonders are important achievements of society, science, culture and defense, ranging from the [[Egyptian pyramids|Pyramid]]s and the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] in the Ancient age, to [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus' Observatory]] and [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan's Expedition]] in the middle period, up to the [[Apollo program]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[Manhattan Project]] in the modern era. Each wonder can only be built once in the world, and requires a lot of resources to build, far more than most other city buildings or units. Wonders provide unique benefits to the controlling civilization. For example, Magellan's Expedition increases the movement rate of naval units. Wonders typically affect either the city in which they are built (for example, the [[Colossus of Rhodes|Colossus]]), every city on the continent (for example, the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon|Hanging Gardens]]), or the civilization as a whole (for example, [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|Darwin's Voyage]]). Some wonders are made obsolete by new technologies.

The game can be won by destroying all other civilizations, reaching the end of the modern era with the highest score, or by winning the [[space colonization|space race]] by reaching the star system of [[Alpha Centauri]].

==Development==
Meier admits to &quot;borrowing&quot; many of the technology tree ideas from a [[board game]] also called ''[[Civilization (board game)|Civilization]]'', published in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1980 by Hartland Trefoil (later by Gibson Games), and in the [[United States]] in 1981 by [[Avalon Hill]]. The early versions of the game even included a flier of information and ordering materials for the board game. There is now a board game based on the computer game version of ''Civilization''.

Meier was the third major designer to plan a computer version of ''Civilization'', but the first to actually carry out that plan. [[Danielle Bunten Berry]] planned to start work on the game after completing ''[[M.U.L.E.]]'' in 1983, and again in 1985, after completing ''[[The Seven Cities of Gold (video game)|The Seven Cities of Gold]]'' at [[Electronic Arts]]. In 1983 Bunten and producer [[Joe Ybarra]] opted to first do ''Seven Cities of Gold''. The success of ''Seven Cities'' in 1985 in turn led to a sequel, ''[[Heart of Africa]]''. Bunten never returned to the idea of ''Civilization''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization/trivia Game Trivia for Sid Meier's Civilization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Meier's designs of ''[[Sid Meier's Pirates!|Pirates!]]'' and ''[[Colonization (computer game)|Colonization]]'' both contain elements of Bunten's ''The Seven Cities of Gold''. [[Don Daglow]], designer of ''[[Utopia (video game)|Utopia]]'', the first [[simulation game]], began work programming a version of ''Civilization'' in 1987. He dropped the project, however, when he was offered an executive position at [[Brøderbund]], and never returned to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11228|title=Column: 'Playing Catch Up: Stormfront Studios' Don Daglow'|author=Alistair Wallis|publisher=Gamasutra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the first version of ''Civilization'' was being developed, it was designed to run on an IBM PC computer, which at the time was transitioning from 16 color [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] to [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]], which could use 256 different colors. The decision to limit the number of different civilizations to 16 was made to make ''Civilization'' compatible with both display standards: 16 civilizations for the 16 colors available to EGA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1523/the_history_of_civilization.php?page=6 | title= The History of Civilization | accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=February 2011}} &lt;!-- come on, this game has won SO many various awards.. not to metion stellar scores --&gt;

This game has been one of the most popular [[strategy game]]s of all time, and has a loyal following of fans. The game (by means of all its versions and updates) has endured for almost two decades, with product being offered for sale the entire time in retail stores. This high level of interest has spawned a number of [[free and open source software|free and open source]] versions and inspired similar games by other commercial developers, as well.

In 1992, ''Civilization'' won the [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Military or Strategy Computer Game of 1991''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.originsgames.com/awards/1991 | title=Origin Awards 1991 | accessdate=2007-06-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070528183529/http://www.originsgames.com/awards/1991 |archivedate = May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 1996, ''[[Computer Gaming World|Computer Gaming World's]]'' Anniversary Edition, ''Civilization'' was chosen the #1 of the 150 Best Games of All Time, and it was described as follows:

{{quotation|While some games might be equally addictive, none have sustained quite the level of rich, satisfying gameplay quite like Sid Meier's magnum opus. The blend of exploration, economics, conquest and diplomacy is augmented by the quintessential research and development model, as you struggle to erect the Pyramids, discover gunpowder, and launch a colonization spacecraft to ''Alpha Centauri''. For its day, ''Civilization'' had the toughest computer opponents around - even taking into account the &quot;cheats&quot;, that in most instances added rather than detracted from the game. Just when you think the game might bog down, you discover a new land, a new technology, another tough foe - and you tell yourself, &quot;just one more game&quot;, even as the first rays of the new sun creep into your room... the most acute case of game-lock we've ever felt.}}

''Civilization'' was named one of the 16 most influential games in history at Telespiele, a German technology and games trade show, in 2007.&lt;ref name=gsw_top16&gt;{{cite web | last = Plunkett | first = Luke | title = German Journos Pick Their Most Important Games Of All Time | publisher = Kotaku | date = August 27, 2007 | url = http://kotaku.com/gaming/notag/german-journos-pick-their-most-important-games-of-all-time-293565.php | accessdate = 2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also named #4 on [[IGN]]'s 2000 &quot;Top 25 PC Games of All Time&quot; list.&lt;ref name=ign_top25_2000&gt;{{cite web | title = The Top 25 PC Games of All Time | publisher = IGN | date = July 24, 2000 | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/082/082486p1.html | accessdate = 2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiplayer remake {{Anchor|CivNet}}==
''Sid Meier's CivNet'' was released in 1995 and was a remake of the original game with added multiplayer, improved graphics and sound, and [[Windows 3.1]]/[[Windows 95|95]] support. Gameplay was almost identical to the original game. There were several methods of multiplayer, including [[Local area network|LAN]], primitive Internet play, [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseat]], modem, and direct serial link.

==Legacy==
{{see also|Civilization (series)}}

There have been several sequels to ''Civilization'', including ''[[Civilization II]]'', ''[[Civilization III]]'', ''[[Civilization IV]]'', ''[[Civilization Revolution]]'', and ''[[Civilization V]]''. The last of these, ''Civilization V'', was released in North America on September 21, 2010 and internationally on September 24, 2010. 

An open source clone of ''Civilization'' has been developed under the name of ''[[Freeciv]]'', with the slogan &quot;'Cause civilization should be free&quot;. Currently it can be configured to match the rules of both ''Civilization'' and ''Civilization II''. Another game that partially clones it is a [[public domain]] game called ''[[C-evo]]''.

In 1994, MicroProse published ''[[Master of Magic]]'', a similar game but embedded in a medieval-fantasy setting where instead of technologies the player (a powerful wizard) develops spells, among other things. The game also shared many things with the popular fantasy card-trading game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''.

Also in 1994, Meier produced a similar game called ''[[Sid Meier's Colonization|Colonization]]''. ''Colonization'', while very similar to ''Civilization'', never became as popular. It has been criticized on several theoretical grounds, particularly because it allows the player to exterminate native tribes and because it ignores [[slavery]] and other historically important features in the creation of many nations and empires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gameology.org/alien_other/colonization Sid Meier’s Colonization | Gameology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Civilization III'', however, recognized slavery in the game play.

The 1999 game ''[[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]]'' was also created by Meier and is in the same genre, but with a futuristic/space theme. Many of the interface and gameplay innovations in this game eventually made their way into ''Civilization III'' and ''IV''. ''Alpha Centauri'' essentially picks up where ''Civilization'' and ''Civilization II'' left off, with the space ship arriving at Sol's closest neighbor.

In 1999, [[Activision]] released ''[[Civilization: Call to Power]]'', a sequel of sorts to ''[[Civilization II]]'' but created by a completely different design team. Gamers that year had a choice between a new game with the ''Civilization'' name but no involvement of Sid Meier; and a &quot;space&quot;-themed civilization game without the name but clearly designed by the same team (''[[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]]''). ''Call to Power'' spawned a sequel in 2000, but by then Activision had lost the rights to the ''Civilization'' name and could only call it ''[[Call to Power II]]''.

His music is noted for its sensory component and for not often forming around one key or pitch. Often Debussy's work reflected the activities or turbulence in his own life. His music virtually defines the transition from late-[[Romantic music]] to 20th century [[modernism (music)|modernist music]]. In French literary circles, the style of this period was known as [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], a movement that directly inspired Debussy both as a composer and as an active cultural participant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartmann&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hartmann|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur Hartmann|title=&quot;Claude Debussy as I Knew Him&quot; and Other Writings of Arthur Hartmann|coauthors=Hsu, Samuel; Grolnic, Sidney; Peters, Mark A.|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|year=2003|isbn=1580461042|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fp5pM0oiUucC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and studies===
Claude Debussy was born in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], France, August 22, 1862, the eldest of five children. His father, Manuel-Achille Debussy, owned a shop where he sold [[chinese ceramics|china]] and crockery, and his mother, Victorine Manoury Debussy, was a seamstress. The family moved to Paris in 1867, but in 1870 Debussy's pregnant mother sought refuge from the Franco-Prussian war with a paternal aunt of Claude's in [[Cannes]]. Debussy began piano lessons there at the age of seven years with an elderly Italian violinist named Cerutti; his lessons were paid for by his aunt. In 1871 he drew the attention of Marie Mauté de Fleurville,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leon Vallas|title=Claude Debussy – His Life and Works|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=shLCyqsb4qoC&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=March 2007|publisher=Lightning Source Inc|isbn=9781406759129|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; who claimed to have been a pupil of [[Frédéric Chopin]]. Debussy always believed her, although there is no independent evidence of her claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Mason Greene|title=Greene's biographical encyclopedia of composers|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=m3S7PIxe0mwC&amp;pg=PA904|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=25 September 2007|publisher=Reproducing Piano Roll Fnd.|isbn=9780385142786|pages=904–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His talents soon became evident, and in 1872, at age ten, Debussy entered the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]], where he spent eleven years. During his time there he studied composition with [[Ernest Guiraud]], music history/theory with [[Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray]], harmony with [[Émile Durand]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debussy.fr/encd/bio/bio1_62-82.php Centre de documentation Claude Debussy]&lt;/ref&gt; piano with [[Antoine François Marmontel]], organ with [[César Franck]], and [[solfège]] with [[Albert Lavignac]], as well as other significant figures of the era. He also became a lifelong friend of fellow student and noted pianist [[Isidor Philipp]]. After Debussy's death, many pianists sought out Philipp for advice on playing his music.

From the start, though clearly talented, Debussy was argumentative and experimental. He challenged the rigid teaching of the Academy, favoring instead dissonances and intervals that were frowned upon. Like [[Georges Bizet]], he was a brilliant pianist and an outstanding sight reader, who could have had a professional career as such had he so wished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold C. Schonberg]], ''The Great Pianists'', p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces he played in public at this time included sonata movements by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]; and Chopin – the [[Ballade No. 2 (Chopin)|Ballade No. 2]], a movement from the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Chopin)|Piano Concerto No. 1]], and the ''[[Allegro de concert (Chopin)|Allegro de concert]]'', a relatively little-known piece but one requiring an advanced technique (it was originally intended to be the opening movement of a third piano concerto).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.djupdal.org/karstein/debussy/concerts.shtml |title=Concerts where Debussy appeared as a pianist |publisher=Djupdal.org |accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summers of 1880, 1881, and 1882 Debussy accompanied the wealthy patroness of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Nadezhda von Meck]], as she traveled with her family in Europe and Russia. The young composer's many musical activities during these vacations included playing four-hand pieces with von Meck at the piano, giving her children music lessons, and performing in private concerts with some of her musician friends.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lockspeiser,Debussy: His Life and Mind, vol. 1, The Macmillan Company, 1962, pp. 40–47&lt;/ref&gt; Despite von Meck's closeness with Tchaikovsky, the Russian master appears to have had little or no effect on Debussy. In September 1880 she sent Debussy's ''Danse bohémienne'' for Tchaikovsky's perusal. A month later Tchaikovsky wrote back to her, &quot;It is a very pretty piece, but it is much too short. Not a single idea is expressed fully, the form is terribly shriveled, and it lacks unity&quot;. Debussy did not publish the piece; the manuscript remained in the von Meck family, and it was sold to B. Schott's Sohne in Mainz, and published by them in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Poznansky, ''Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man'', p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; A greater influence was Debussy's close friendship with Madame Vasnier, a singer he met when he began working as an accompanist to earn some money. She and her husband gave Debussy emotional and professional support. Monsieur Vasnier introduced him to the writings of influential French writers of the time, which gave rise to his first songs, settings of poems by [[Paul Verlaine]], the son-in-law of his former teacher, Mme. Mauté de Fleurville.
[[File:Debussy 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Debussy at the [[Villa Medici]] in Rome, 1885, at centre in the white jacket]]
As the winner of the 1884 [[Prix de Rome]] with his composition ''[[L'enfant prodigue]]'', Debussy received a scholarship to the Académie des Beaux-Arts, which included a four-year residence at the [[Villa Medici]], the [[French Academy in Rome]], to further his studies (1885–1887). According to letters to Madame Vasnier, perhaps in part designed to gain her sympathy, he found the artistic atmosphere stifling, the company boorish, the food bad, and the monastic quarters &quot;abominable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; Neither did he delight in the pleasures of the &quot;Eternal City&quot;, finding the Italian opera of [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] not to his taste. Debussy was often depressed and unable to compose, but he was inspired by [[Franz Liszt]], whose command of the keyboard he found admirable.

In June 1885, Debussy wrote of his desire to follow his own way, saying, &quot;I am sure the Institute would not approve, for, naturally it regards the path which it ordains as the only right one. But there is no help for it! I am too enamoured of my freedom, too fond of my own ideas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

Debussy finally composed four pieces that were sent to the Academy: the symphonic ode ''Zuleima'', based on a text by [[Heinrich Heine]]; the orchestral piece ''Printemps''; the [[cantata]] ''La damoiselle élue'' (1887–1888), which was criticized by the Academy as &quot;bizarre&quot;; and the ''Fantaisie'' for piano and orchestra. The third piece was the first in which stylistic features of Debussy's later style emerged. The fourth piece was heavily based on [[César Franck]]'s music and Debussy withdrew it. The Academy chided him for &quot;courting the unusual&quot; and hoped for something better from the gifted student. Even though Debussy's works showed the influence of [[Jules Massenet]], Massenet concluded, &quot;He is an enigma.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

During his visits to [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth]] in 1888-9, Debussy was exposed to [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] opera, which had a lasting impact on his work. [[Richard Wagner]] had died in 1883 and the cult of Wagnerism was still in full swing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Debussy, like many young musicians of the time, responded positively to Wagner's sensuousness, mastery of form, and striking harmonies. Wagner's extroverted emotionalism was not to be Debussy's way {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, but the German composer's influence is evident in ''La damoiselle élue'' and the 1889 piece ''Cinq poèmes de Charles Baudelaire''. Other songs of the period, notably the settings of Verlaine —''Ariettes oubliées'', ''Trois mélodies'', and ''Fêtes galantes''— are all in a more capricious style. Around this time, Debussy met [[Erik Satie]], who proved a kindred spirit in his experimental approach to composition and to naming his pieces. During this period, both musicians were bohemians enjoying the same cafe society and struggling to stay afloat financially.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In 1889, at the ''[[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]]'' in Paris, Debussy heard [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[gamelan]] music. Although direct citations of gamelan scales, melodies, rhythms, or ensemble textures have not been identified in any of Debussy's compositions, the equal-tempered [[pentatonic scale]] appears in his music of this time and afterward.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Private life===
Debussy's private life was often turbulent. At the age of 18 he began an eight-year affair with Blanche Vasnier, wife of a wealthy Parisian lawyer. The relationship eventually faltered following his winning of the Prix de Rome and obligatory incarceration in the eponymous city.

On his permanent return to Paris and his parents' home on the av. de Berlin in 1889, he began a tempestuous nine-year relationship with Gabrielle ('Gaby') Dupont, a tailor's daughter from [[Lisieux]], with whom he later cohabited on the Rue Gustave Doré. During this time he also had an affair with the singer [[Thérèse Roger]], to whom he was briefly engaged.

He left Dupont for her friend Rosalie ('Lily') Texier, a [[model (person)|fashion model]] whom he married in 1899. Although Texier was affectionate, practical, straightforward, and well liked by Debussy's friends and associates, he became increasingly irritated by her intellectual limitations and lack of musical sensitivity. In 1904, Debussy was introduced to [[Emma Bardac]], wife of Parisian banker Sigismond Bardac, by her son Raoul, one of his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leon Vallas|title=Claude Debussy – His Life and Works|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=shLCyqsb4qoC&amp;pg=PA169|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=March 2007|publisher=Lightning Source Inc|isbn=9781406759129|pages=169–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Texier, Bardac was a sophisticate, a brilliant conversationalist, and an accomplished singer. After despatching Lilly back to her father's home in [[Bichain]] on 15 July 1904, Debussy secretly took Bardac to [[Jersey]] for a holiday. On their return to France, Debussy wrote to Texier from [[Dieppe]] on 11 August, informing her their marriage was over, but still making no mention of Bardac. On 14 October, five days before their fifth wedding anniversary, Texier attempted suicide, shooting herself in the chest while standing in the [[Place de la Concorde]]; she survived, although the bullet remained lodged in her [[vertebrae]] until her death in 1932. The ensuing scandal was to alienate Debussy from many of his friends, whilst Bardac was disowned by her family.&lt;ref name=Enget&gt;Enget, D. (2005). ''Debussy in Jersey. The centenary, 1904–2004'' [http://www.litart.co.uk].&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the spring of 1905, finding the hostility towards them intolerable, Debussy and Bardac (now pregnant) fled to England, via Jersey,&lt;ref name = Rodoni&gt;Claude Achille Debussy http://www.rodoni.ch/opernhaus/pelleas/Debussy2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; settling at the [[Grand Hotel Eastbourne|Grand Hotel]] in [[Eastbourne]] from 24 July to 30 August 1905,&lt;ref&gt;Eastbourne Local Historian (Eastbourne Local History Society) Nr 157 – Autumn 2010&lt;/ref&gt; where Debussy was to correct proofs to his symphonic suite ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Debussy.fr&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Enget&quot;/&gt; and celebrate his divorce from Texier on 2 August. After concluding their holiday with a brief visit to [[London]], they returned to Paris, soon setting up home on the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne (now Avenue Foch), where he was to reside for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debussypiano.com/foch.htm Claude Debussy's residence]&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter (and the composer's only child), Claude-Emma, was born there on 30 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enget&quot;/&gt; More affectionately known as 'Chouchou', Claude-Emma was the dedicatee of Debussy's ''[[Children's Corner]]'' suite; she outlived her father by scarcely a year, succumbing to the [[diphtheria]] epidemic of 1919. Her parents were eventually married in 1908, their troubled union enduring until Debussy's death in 1918.

===Death===
[[File:Debussy's grave.jpg|thumb|Debussy's grave at [[Passy Cemetery]]]]
Debussy died of [[Colorectal cancer|rectal cancer]] in Paris on March 25, 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debussy, Claude Achille&quot;/&gt; He had been diagnosed with the cancer in 1909 &lt;ref name=Enget/&gt; after experiencing [[haemorrhaging]], and in 1916 underwent one of the first [[colostomy]] operations ever performed. The operation achieved only a temporary respite, and occasioned him considerable frustration (he was to liken dressing in the morning to &quot;all the labours of Hercules in one&quot;). His death occurred in the midst of the aerial and artillery bombardment of Paris during the German [[Spring Offensive]] of [[World War I]]. The funeral procession made its way through deserted streets to [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] as shells from the German guns ripped into his beloved city. At this time, the military situation in France was desperate, and circumstances did not permit the honour of a public funeral or ceremonious graveside orations. It was just eight months before France would celebrate victory. Debussy's body was reinterred shortly afterwards in the small [[Passy Cemetery]] sequestered behind the [[Trocadéro]]; his wife and daughter are buried with him.

==Musical style==
[[File:Debussy's chords for Guiraud.png|thumb|250px|Chords, featuring chromatically altered sevenths and ninths and progressing unconventionally, explored by Debussy in a, &quot;celebrated conversation at the piano with his teacher Ernest Guiraud&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lockspeiser, Edward (1962). ''Debussy: His Life and Mind'', p.207. ISBN 0304918784 for Vol. 1. cited in Nadeau, Roland (Sep., 1979), &quot;Debussy and the Crisis of Tonality&quot;, p.71, ''Music Educators Journal'', Vol. 66, No. 1, pp. 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Rudolph Reti]] points out these features of Debussy's music, which &quot;established a new concept of tonality in European music&quot;:
# Glittering passages and webs of figurations which distract from occasional absence of tonality;
# Frequent use of [[parallel chord]]s which are &quot;in essence not harmonies at all, but rather 'chordal melodies', enriched unisons&quot;; some writers describe these as non-functional harmonies;
# Bitonality, or at least [[bitonal]] chords;
# Use of the [[Major second|whole-tone]] and [[pentatonic scale]];
# Unprepared [[modulation (music)|modulations]], &quot;without any harmonic bridge.&quot;
He concludes that Debussy's achievement was the synthesis of monophonic based &quot;melodic tonality&quot; with harmonies, albeit different from those of &quot;harmonic tonality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Reti|first=Rudolph|title=Tonality, Atonality, Pantonality|location=Westport, CT|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1958|isbn=0313204780}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

The application of the term &quot;impressionist&quot; to Debussy and the music he influenced is a matter of intense debate within academic circles. One side argues that the term is a misnomer, an inappropriate label which Debussy himself opposed. In a letter of 1908, he wrote &quot;I am trying to do 'something different'--an effect of reality...what the imbeciles call 'impressionism', a term which is as poorly used as possible, particularly by the critics, since they do not hesitate to apply it to Turner, the finest creator of mysterious effects in all the world of art.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p.161&lt;/ref&gt; The opposing side argues that Debussy may have been reacting to unfavorable criticism at the time, and the negativity that critics associated with impressionism. It can be argued that he would have been pleased with application of the current definition of impressionism to his music.

===Early works===
[[File:Debussy 1893.jpg|thumb|Debussy at the piano, in front of the composer [[Ernest Chausson]], 1893]]
&lt;!--this section needs something about Deb's songs--&gt;
Beginning in the 1890s, Debussy developed his own musical language largely independent of Wagner's style, colored in part from the dreamy, sometimes morbid romanticism of the [[Symbolist Movement]]. Debussy became a frequent participant at [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]'s Symbolist gatherings, where Wagnerism dominated the discussion. In contrast to the enormous works of Wagner and other late-romantic composers, however, around this time Debussy chose to write in smaller, more accessible forms. The ''[[Arabesques (Debussy)|Deux Arabesques]]'' is an example of one of Debussy's earliest works, already developing his musical language. ''[[Suite bergamasque]]'' (1890) recalls [[rococo]] decorousness with a modern cynicism and puzzlement. This suite contains one of Debussy's most popular pieces, ''[[Suite bergamasque|Clair de Lune]]''. Debussy's [[String Quartet (Debussy)|String Quartet in G minor]] (1893) paved the way for his later, more daring harmonic exploration. In this work he utilized the [[Phrygian mode|Phrygian]] [[musical mode|mode]] as well as less standard scales, such as the [[Whole-tone scale|whole-tone]], which creates a sense of floating, ethereal harmony. Debussy was beginning to employ a single, continuous theme and break away from the traditional A-B-A form, with its restatements and amplifications, which had been a mainstay of classical music since [[Haydn]].

Influenced by Mallarmé, Debussy wrote one of his most famous works, the revolutionary ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune]]'', truly original in form and execution. In contrast to the large orchestras so favoured by late-romanticism, Debussy wrote this piece for a smaller ensemble, emphasizing instrumental colour and timbre. Despite Mallarmé himself, and colleague and friend [[Paul Dukas]] having been impressed by the piece, it was controversial at its premiere. ''Prélude'' subsequently placed Debussy into the spotlight as one of the leading composers of the era.

===Middle works===
&lt;!--Input intro stuff here--&gt;
The three ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' (1899), include characteristic studies in veiled harmony and texture as demonstrated in ''Nuages''; exuberance in ''Fêtes''; and whole-tones in ''Sirènes''. Contrasting sharply with Wagnerian opera, Debussy's ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' premiered in 1902, after ten years of work. It would be his only complete opera. Based on the play by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], the opera proved to be an immediate success and immensely influential to younger French composers, including [[Maurice Ravel]]. These works brought a fluidity of rhythm and colour quite new to Western music.

''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1903–1905) essays a more symphonic form, with a finale that works themes from the first movement, although the middle movement, ''Jeux de vagues'', proceeds much less directly and with more variety of colour. Again, the reviews were sharply divided. Some critics thought the treatment to be less subtle and less mysterious than his previous works and even a step backward. Pierre Lalo complained &quot;I neither hear, nor see, nor feel the sea&quot;. Others extolled its &quot;power and charm&quot;, its &quot;extraordinary verve and brilliant fantasy&quot;, and its strong colors and definite lines.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 158–9&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period Debussy wrote much for the piano. The set of pieces entitled ''[[Pour le piano]]'' (1901) utilises rich harmonies and textures which would later prove important in [[jazz]] music. His first volume of ''Images pour piano'' (1904–1905) combine harmonic innovation with poetic suggestion: ''[[Reflets dans l'eau]]'' is a musical description of rippling water; ''Hommage à Rameau'', the second piece, is slow and yearningly nostalgic. It takes as its inspiration a melody from [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''[[Castor et Pollux]]''.

The evocative ''[[Estampes]]'' for piano (1903) give impressions of exotic locations. Debussy came into contact with [[Java]]nese [[gamelan]] music during the 1889 Paris ''[[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]]''. ''Pagodes'' is the directly inspired result, aiming for an evocation of the pentatonic structures employed by the Javanese music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://brenthugh.com/debnotes/gamelan.html|title=Claude Debussy and the Javanese Gamelan|author=Brent Hugh|publisher=brenthugh.com|accessdate=2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debussy wrote his famous ''[[Children's Corner]] Suite'' (1908) for his beloved daughter, Claude-Emma, whom he nicknamed ''Chouchou''. The suite recalls classicism—the opening piece ''Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum'' refers to [[Muzio Clementi]]'s collection of instructional piano compositions ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum]]'', as well as a new wave of American ragtime music. In the popular final piece of the suite, ''Golliwogg's Cakewalk'', Debussy also pokes fun at [[Richard Wagner]] by mimicking the opening bars of Wagner's prelude to ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.

The first book of ''[[Préludes (Debussy)|Préludes]]'' (1910), twelve in total, proved to be his most successful work for piano. The Preludes are frequently compared to those of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]].&lt;!--which set?--&gt; Debussy's preludes are replete with rich, unusual and daring harmonies. They include the popular ''La Fille aux Cheveux de Lin'' (The Girl with the Flaxen Hair) and ''La Cathédrale Engloutie'' (The Engulfed Cathedral). Debussy wanted people to respond intuitively to these pieces and so he placed the titles at the end of each one in the hope that listeners would not make stereotype images as they listened.

Larger scaled works included his orchestral piece ''Iberia'' (1907), began as a work for two pianos, a [[triptych]] medley of Spanish allusions and fleeting impressions and also the music for [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]]'s mystery play ''[[Le martyre de Saint Sébastien]]'' (1911). A lush and dramatic work, written in only two months, it is remarkable in sustaining a [[Late Antiquity|late antique]] [[musical mode|modal]] atmosphere that otherwise was touched only in relatively short piano pieces.

During this period, as Debussy gained more popularity, he was engaged as a conductor throughout Europe, most often performing ''Pelléas'', ''La Mer'', and ''Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune''. He was also an occasional music critic to supplement his conducting fees and piano lessons. Debussy avoided analytical dissection and attempts to force images from music, &quot;Let us at all costs preserve this magic peculiar to music, since of all the arts it is most susceptible to magic.&quot; He could be caustic and witty, sometimes sloppy and ill-informed. Debussy was for the most part enthusiastic about [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], worshipful of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and found both [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] geniuses who sometimes lacked &quot;taste&quot;. He also admired the works of [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jackgibbons.com/alkanmyths.htm |title=The Myths of Alkan |publisher=Jack Gibbons |accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] fared much worse, the latter being described as a &quot;facile and elegant notary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 180–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late works===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
Debussy's [[harmonies]] and [[chord (music)|chord]] progressions frequently exploit [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonances]] without any formal resolution. Unlike in his earlier work, he no longer hides discords in lush harmonies. The forms are far more irregular and fragmented. These chords that seemingly had no resolution were described by Debussy himself as &quot;floating chords&quot;, and were used to set tone and mood in many of his works. The [[whole tone scale]] dominates much of Debussy's late music.&lt;!--Input more intro stuff here--&gt;

His two last volumes of works for the piano, the ''[[Études (Debussy)|Études]]'' (1915) interprets similar varieties of style and texture purely as pianistic exercises and includes pieces that develop irregular form to an extreme as well as others influenced by the young [[Igor Stravinsky]] (a presence too in the suite ''En blanc et noir'' for two pianos, 1915). The rarefaction of these works is a feature of the last set of songs, the ''Trois poèmes de Mallarmé'' (1913), and of the [[Sonata (music)|Sonata]] for flute, viola and harp (1915), though the sonata and its companions also recapture the inquisitive Verlainian classicism.

With the sonatas of 1915–1917, there is a sudden shift in the style. These works recall Debussy's earlier music, in part, but also look forward, with leaner, simpler structures. Despite the thinner textures of the [[Violin Sonata (Debussy)|Violin Sonata]] (1917) there remains an undeniable richness in the chords themselves. This shift parallels the movement commonly known as [[Neoclassicism (music)|neo-classicism]] which became popular after Debussy's death. Debussy planned a set of six sonatas, but this plan was cut short by his death in 1918 so that he only completed three (cello, flute-viola-harp and violin sonatas).

[[File:Caplet Debussy.jpg|thumb|Caplet and Debussy]]
The last orchestral work by Debussy, the ballet ''[[Jeux]]'' (1912) written for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]], contains some of his strangest harmonies and textures in a form that moves freely over its own field of motivic connection. At first ''Jeux'' was overshadowed by [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', composed in the same year as ''Jeux'' and premiered only two weeks later by the same ballet company. Decades later, composers such as [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Jean Barraqué]] pointed out parallels to [[Anton Webern]]'s [[serialism]] in this work. Other late stage works, including the ballets ''[[Khamma (ballet)|Khamma]]'' (1912) and ''[[La boîte à joujoux]]'' (1913) were left with the orchestration incomplete, and were later completed by [[Charles Koechlin]] and [[André Caplet]], who also helped Debussy with the orchestration of ''Gigues'' (from ''Images pour orchestre'') and ''Le martyre de St. Sébastien''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Barraqué|first=Jean |title=Debussy (Solfèges)| location=Paris|publisher=Editions du Seuil|year=1977|isbn=2020002426}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The second set of ''[[Préludes (Debussy)|Préludes]]'' for piano (1913) features Debussy at his most [[avant-garde]], where he utilizes dissonant harmonies to evoke specific moods and images. Debussy consciously gives titles to each prelude that amplify the preludes’ tonal ambiguity and dissonance. He utilizes scales such as the whole tone scale, musical modes, and the octatonic scale in his preludes that exaggerate this tonal ambiguity, making the key of each prelude almost indistinguishable at times. The second book of Preludes for piano represents Debussy’s strong interest in the indefinite and esoteric.

Although ''Pelléas'' was Debussy's only completed opera, he began several opera projects which remained unfinished, his fading concentration, increasing procrastination, and failing health perhaps the reasons. He had finished some partial musical sketches and some unpublished libretti for operas based on [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]'s ''[[The Devil in the Belfry]]'' (''[[Le diable dans le beffroi]]'', 1902–?1912) and ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]'' (''[[La chute de la maison Usher (opera)|La chute de la maison Usher]]'', 1908–1917) as well as considered projects for operas based on Shakespeare's ''[[As You Like It]]'' and Joseph Bedier's ''La Legende de Tristan''.

Further plans, such as an American tour, more ballet scores, and revisions of Chopin and Bach works for re-publication, were all cut short by the outbreak of World War I and his poor health.

===Mathematical structuring===
Given that Debussy's music is apparently so concerned with mood and colour, one may be surprised to discover that, according to Howat, many of his greatest works appear to have been structured around mathematical models even while using an apparent classical structure such as [[sonata form]]. Howat suggests that some of Debussy's pieces can be divided into sections that reflect the [[golden ratio]], frequently by using the numbers of the standard [[Fibonacci sequence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Howat1983&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last=Howat|first=Roy|title=Debussy in Proportion: A musical analysis|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983|isbn=0521311454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes these divisions seem to follow the standard divisions of the overall structure. In other pieces they appear to mark out other significant features of the music. The 55 bar-long introduction to 'Dialogue du vent et la mer' in ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'', for example, breaks down into 5 sections of 21, 8, 8, 5 and 13 bars in length. The golden mean point of bar 34 in this structure is signalled by the introduction of the trombones, with the use of the main motif from all three movements used in the central section around that point.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howat1983&quot; /&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2008}}&lt;!-- page 96 --&gt;

The only evidence that Howat introduces to support his claim appears in changes Debussy made between finished manuscripts and the printed edition, with the changes invariably creating a Golden Mean proportion where previously none existed. Perhaps the starkest example of this comes with ''[[La cathédrale engloutie]]''. Published editions lack the instruction to play bars 7–12 and 22–83 at twice the speed of the remainder, exactly as Debussy himself did on a piano-roll recording. When analysed with this alteration, the piece follows Golden Section proportions. At the same time, Howat admits that in many of Debussy's works, he has been unable to find evidence of the Golden Section (notably in the late works) and that no extant manuscripts or sketches contain any evidence of calculations related to it.

===Influences===
Debussy had a wide range of influences. Among the Russian composers of his time, the most prominent influences on Debussy were Tchaikovsky, Balakirev, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and Mussorgsky.&lt;ref name=&quot;leshow&quot;&gt;François Lesure and Roy Howat. &quot;Debussy, Claude.&quot; Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 14 Dec. 2009 &lt;http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/07353&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be inferred that from the Russians “Debussy acquired his taste for ancient and oriental modes and for vivid colorations, and a certain disdain for academic rules.”&lt;ref name=&quot;leshow&quot; /&gt; Specifically, Mussorgsky’s opera Boris Godunov directly influenced one of Debussy’s most famous works, Pelléas et Mélisande. In addition to the Russian composers, one of Debussy’s biggest influences was Richard Wagner. According to Pierre Louys, Debussy “did not see ‘what anyone can do beyond Tristan.”&lt;ref name=&quot;leshow&quot; /&gt; After Debussy’s Wagner phase, he started to become immensely interested in non-western music. He was drawn to unorthodox approaches to composition that non-western music utilized. Specifically, he was drawn to a Javanese Gamelan, which was a musical ensemble from the island of Java that played an array of unique instrumentation. He first heard the gamelan at the 1889 Paris Exposition. Debussy was not as interested in directly citing his non-western influence in his music, but instead used his non-western influence to shape his unique musical style in more of a general way.

Debussy was just as influenced by other art forms as he was by music, if not more so. He took a strong interest in literature and visual art and used these mediums to help shape his unique musical style. Debussy was heavily influenced by the French symbolist movement, which was an art movement in 1885 that influenced art forms such as poetry, visual art, and theatre. He shared the movement’s interest in the esoteric and indefinite and rejection of naturalism and realism. Specifically, “the development of free verse in poetry and the disappearance of the subject or model in painting influenced Debussy to think about issues of musical form.”&lt;ref name=&quot;leshow&quot; /&gt; Debussy became personally acquainted with writers and painters of the movement and based his own works off of those of the symbolists. One of Debussy’s main influences was the famous poet Stéphane Mallarmé, who “held the idea of a ‘musicalization’ of poetry.”&lt;ref name=&quot;leshow&quot; /&gt; In other words, Mallarmé drew strong connections between music and his poetry. Debussy wrote &quot;Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune&quot;, which was directly influenced by Mallarmé’s poem “Afternoon of a Faun.” Like the symbolists in respect to their own art forms, Debussy aimed to reject common techniques and approaches to composition and attempted to evoke more of a sensorial experience for the listener with his works. Since his time at the Paris Conservatoire, Debussy believed he had much more to learn from artists than from musicians who were primarily interested in their musical careers.

Contemporary painter [[James McNeill Whistler]] who lived in [[France]] for a period of time had a profound influence on Debussy. In 1894, Debussy wrote to violinist [[Eugène Ysaÿe]] describing his ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' as &quot;an experiment in the different combinations that can be obtained from one color – what a study in grey would be in painting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, Stanley. 2001. ''Whistler: a biography'' (New York: Da Capo Press). ISBN 9780306809712. p, 351&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not known what it is meant by this statement, one can observe in his music a careful use of orchestral, textural, and harmonic 'shading'.

===Influence on later composers===
Claude Debussy is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. His harmonies, considered radical in his day, were influential to almost every major composer of the 20th century, especially the music of [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Henri Dutilleux]], [[Ned Rorem]], and the [[minimalist music]] of [[Steve Reich]] and [[Philip Glass]] as well as the influential Japanese composer [[Toru Takemitsu]]. He also influenced many important figures in [[Jazz]], most notably [[George Gershwin]], [[Bill Evans]], George Shearing, [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]], [[Herbie Hancock]] and [[Jimmy Giuffre]]. Furthermore, he had a profound impact on contemporary soundtrack composers such as [[John Williams]] because Debussy's colorful and suggesting style translated easily into an emotional language for use in motion picture scores. In 1999, [[The Art of Noise]] released a concept album titled ''[[The Seduction of Claude Debussy]]''. The group blended the music of Debussy with drum and bass, opera, hip hop, jazz, and narration, and described the album as &quot;the soundtrack to a film that wasn't made about the life of Claude Debussy&quot;. In 2000, the band released ''Reduction'', a limited-edition album composed mainly of outtakes from this album.

[[Leopold Stokowski]], in an article, pointed out the identification of composers including Debussy with the music of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], providing an inspiration for non-contrapuntal music.

'''Cultural imperialism''' is the domination of one culture over another other by a deliberate policy or by economic or technological superiority. ''Cultural imperialism'' can take the form of an active, formal policy or a general attitude. A metaphor of [[colonialism]] is employed:  the cultural products of the [[first world]] &quot;invade&quot; the [[third-world]] and &quot;conquer&quot; local culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Victoria D.|title=Sociology of the arts: exploring fine and popular forms|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell,|year= 2003|pages=162|chapter=The Cultural Diamond - The Production of Culture|isbn=0631230408, 9780631230403}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the stronger variants of the term, [[Hegemony|world domination]] (in a cultural sense) is the explicit goal of the  [[nation-state]]s or [[multinational corporation]]s that export the culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander&quot; /&gt;  The term is usually used in a pejorative sense, often in conjunction with a call to reject such influence.

==Background and definitions==

The term appears to have emerged in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson (1991), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a focus of research since at least the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hamm, (2005), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Terms such as &quot;[[media imperialism]]&quot;, &quot;structural imperialism&quot;, &quot;cultural dependency and domination&quot;,  &quot;cultural synchronization&quot;, &quot;[[electronic colonialism]]&quot;, &quot;ideological imperialism&quot;, and &quot;[[economic imperialism]]&quot; have all been used to describe the same basic notion of cultural imperialism.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot;&gt;White (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Various academics give various definitions of the term.  American [[media critic]] [[Herbert Schiller]] wrote: &quot;The concept of cultural imperialism today [1975] best describes the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system. The public media are the foremost example of operating enterprises that are used in the penetrative process. For penetration on a significant scale the media themselves must be captured by the dominating/penetrating power. This occurs largely through the commercialization of broadcasting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiller 76&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiller|first=Herbert I.|title=Communication and cultural domination|publisher=International Arts and Sciences Press, 901 North Broadway, White Plains, New York 10603 |year=1976|pages=9–10|isbn=0873320794, 9780873320795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom McPhail]] defined &quot;Electronic colonialism as the dependency relationship established by the importation of communication hardware, foreign-produced software, along with engineers, technicians, and related information protocols, that vicariously establish a set of foreign norms, values, and expectations which, in varying degrees, may alter the domestic cultures and socialization processes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McPhail&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McPhail|first=Thomas L.|title=Electronic colonialism: the future of international broadcasting and communication|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1987|series=Volume 126 of Sage library of social research|pages=18|isbn=0803927304, 9780803927308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sui-Nam Lee observed that &quot;communication imperialism can be defined as the process in which the ownership and control over the hardware and software of mass media as well as other major forms of communication in one country are singly or together subjugated to the domination of another country with deleterious effects on the indigenous values, norms and culture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee |first=Siu-Nam Lee |year=1988|title=Communication imperialism and dependency: A conceptual clarification|journal=International Communication Gazette|publisher=Kiuwer Academic Publishers|location=Netherlands|issue= 41|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ogan saw &quot;media imperialism often described as a process whereby the United States and Western Europe produce most of the media products, make the first profits from domestic sales, and then market the products in Third World countries at costs considerably lower than those the countries would have to bear to produce similar products at home.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ogan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ogan|first=Christine|date=Spring 1988|title=Media Imperialism and the Videocassette Recorder: The Case of Turkey.|journal=Journal of Communication,|volume= 38|issue= 2|pages=p94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downing and Sreberny-Mohammadi state: &quot;Imperialism is the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one. Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force. In the history of colonialism, (i.e., the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreigners), the educational and media systems of many Third World countries have been set up as replicas of those in Britain, France, or the United States and carry their values. Western advertising has made further inroads, as have architectural and fashion styles. Subtly but powerfully, the message has often been insinuated that Western cultures are superior to the cultures of the Third World.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Downing,|first=John|coauthors=Ali Mohammadi, Annabelle Sreberny-Mohammadi|title=Questioning the media: a critical introduction|publisher=SAGE|year=1995|edition=2, illustrated|pages=482|isbn=0803971974, 9780803971974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of cultural imperialism emerged largely from [[communication studies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Salwen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salwen |first=Michael B. |title=Cultural imperialism: A media effects approach  |date=March 1991|journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication|volume= 8|issue= 1 |pages=29–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, cultural imperialism has been used as a framework by scholars to explain phenomena in the areas of [[international relations]], [[anthropology]], education, science, history, literature, and sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;

==Theory and debate==
It can refer to either the forced acculturation of a subject population, or to the voluntary embracing of a foreign culture by individuals who do so of their own free will.  Since these are two very different referents, the validity of the term has been called into question.

Cultural influence can be seen by the &quot;receiving&quot; culture as either a threat to or an enrichment of its [[cultural identity]]. It seems therefore useful to distinguish between cultural imperialism as an (active or passive) attitude of superiority, and the position of a culture or group that seeks to complement its own cultural production, considered partly deficient, with imported products. 

The imported products or services can themselves represent, or be associated with, certain values (such as [[consumerism]]). According to one argument, the &quot;receiving&quot; [[culture]] does not necessarily perceive this link, but instead absorbs the foreign culture passively through the use of the foreign goods and services. Due to its somewhat concealed, but very potent nature, this hypothetical idea is described by some experts as &quot;''banal imperialism''.&quot; Some believe that the newly globalised economy of the late 20th and early 21st century has facilitated this process through the use of new information technology.  This kind of cultural imperialism is derived from what is called &quot;[[soft power]]&quot;. The theory of electronic colonialism extends the issue to global cultural issues and the impact of major multi-media conglomerates, ranging from [[Viacom]], [[Time-Warner]], [[Disney]], [[News Corp]], [[Sony]], to [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] with the focus on the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] power of these mainly [[US]]-based communication giants.

===Cultural diversity===
One of the reasons often given for opposing any form of cultural imperialism, voluntary or otherwise, is the preservation of [[cultural diversity]], a goal seen by some as analogous to the preservation of [[biodiversity|ecological diversity]].  Proponents of this idea argue either that such diversity is valuable in itself, or instrumentally valuable because it makes available more ways of solving problems and responding to catastrophes, natural or otherwise.

===Said and post-colonial studies===
[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] writer, philosopher, and literary theorist, [[Edward Said]], who was one of the founders of the field of [[post-colonialism|post-colonial study]], wrote extensively on the subject of cultural imperialism. His work attempts to highlight the inaccuracies of many assumptions about cultures and societies, and is largely informed by [[Michel Foucault]]'s concepts of [[discourse]] and [[Power (sociology)|power]]. The relatively new academic field of post-colonial theory has been the source for most of the in-depth work on the idea of discursive and other non-military mechanisms of imperialism, and its validity is disputed by those who deny that these forms are genuinely imperialistic.

===Rothkopf on dealing with cultural dominance===
[[David Rothkopf]], managing director of [[Kissinger Associates]] and an adjunct professor of [[international relations|international affairs]] at [[Columbia University]] (who also served as a senior [[US Commerce Department]] official in the [[Clinton Administration]]), wrote about cultural imperialism in his provocatively titled ''In Praise of Cultural Imperialism?'' in the summer 1997 issue of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine. Rothkopf says that the [[US]] should embrace &quot;cultural imperialism&quot; as in its self interest. But his definition of cultural imperialism stresses spreading the values of [[tolerance]] and openness to cultural change in order to avoid war and conflict between cultures as well as expanding accepted technological and legal standards to provide free traders with enough security to do business with more countries. Rothkopf's definition almost exclusively involves allowing individuals in other nations to accept or reject foreign cultural influences. He also mentions, but only in passing, the use of the [[English language]] and consumption of news and popular music and film as cultural dominance that he supports. Rothkopf additionally makes the point that [[globalization]] and the [[Internet]] are accelerating the process of cultural influence.&lt;ref name=rothkopf&gt;[http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/globcult.htm] Rothkopf, David, &quot;In Praise of Cultural Imperialism,&quot; ''Foreign Affairs'', Summer 1997, Volume 107, pp. 38-53; all descriptions of Rothkopf's points and his quotes are from this article&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture is sometimes used by the organizers of society — politicians, theologians, academics, and families — to impose and ensure order, the rudiments of which change over time as need dictates. One need only look at the 20th century's [[genocide]]s. In each one, leaders used culture as a political front to fuel the passions of their armies and other minions and to justify their actions among their people.

Rothkopf then cites genocide and [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]]s in [[Armenia]], [[Russia]], the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Cambodia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Rwanda]] and [[East Timor]] as examples of culture (in some cases expressed in the ideology of &quot;political culture&quot; or religion) being misused to justify violence. He also acknowledges that cultural imperialism in the past has been guilty of forcefully eliminating the cultures of natives in the [[Americas]] and in [[Africa]], or through use of the [[Inquisition]], ''&quot;and during the expansion of virtually every [[empire]].&quot;'' &lt;sup&gt; ([[citation needed]]) &lt;/sup&gt;

The most important way to deal with cultural influence in any nation, according to Rothkopf, is to promote tolerance and allow, or even promote, cultural diversities that are compatible with tolerance and to eliminate those cultural differences that cause violent conflict:

:&quot;Multicultural societies, be they nations, federations, or other conglomerations of closely interrelated states, discern those aspects of culture that do not threaten union, stability, or prosperity (such as food, holidays, rituals, and music) and allow them to flourish. But they counteract or eradicate the more subversive elements of culture (exclusionary aspects of religion, language, and political/ideological beliefs). History shows that bridging cultural gaps successfully and serving as a home to diverse peoples requires certain social structures, laws, and institutions that transcend culture. Furthermore, the history of a number of ongoing experiments in [[multiculturalism]], such as in the [[European Union]], [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]] and the United States, suggests that workable, if not perfected, integrative models exist. Each is built on the idea that tolerance is crucial to social well-being, and each at times has been threatened by both intolerance and a heightened emphasis on cultural distinctions. The greater public good warrants eliminating those cultural characteristics that promote conflict or prevent harmony, even as less-divisive, more personally observed cultural distinctions are celebrated and preserved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = O'Meara | first1 = Patrick. | last2 = Mehlinger | first2 = Howard D. | last3 = Krain | first3 = Matthew. | title = Globalization and the challenges of a new century : a reader | year = 2000 | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington, Ind. | isbn = 978-0-253-21355-6 | pages = 445–446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ThermiteFe2O3.JPG|thumb|A [[thermite]] reaction using [[Iron(III) oxide|ferric oxide]]]]

A '''chemical reaction''' is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of [[chemical substance]]s to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=chemical reaction|file=C01033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical reactions can be either [[Spontaneous process|spontaneous]], requiring no input of energy, or non-spontaneous, typically following the input of some type of energy, viz. heat, light or electricity. Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that strictly involve the motion of [[electrons]] in the forming and breaking of [[chemical bond]]s, although the general concept of a chemical reaction, in particular the notion of a [[chemical equation]], is applicable to [[Feynman diagram|transformations of elementary particles]], as well as [[nuclear reaction]]s.

The substance (or substances) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called [[reagent|reactants or reagents]]. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a [[chemical change]], and they yield one or more [[Product (chemistry)|products]], which usually have properties different from the reactants. Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called [[elementary reaction]]s, and the information on the precise course of action is part of the [[reaction mechanism]]. Chemical reactions are described with [[chemical equation]]s, which graphically present the starting materials, end products, and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions.

Different chemical reactions are used in combination in [[chemical synthesis]] in order to obtain a desired product. In [[biochemistry]], series of chemical reactions [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by [[enzymes]] form [[metabolic pathways]], by which syntheses and decompositions impossible under ordinary conditions are performed within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]].

==History==
[[File:Antoine lavoisier color.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] developed the theory of combustion as a chemical reaction with oxygen]]

Chemical reactions such as combustion in the [[fire]], [[fermentation]] and the reduction of ores to metals were known since antiquity. Initial theories of transformation of materials were developed by Greek philosophers, such as the [[Classical element|Four-Element Theory]] of [[Empedocles]] stating that any substance is composed of the four basic elements – fire, water, air and earth. In the Middle Ages, chemical transformations were studied by [[Alchemy|Alchemists]]. They attempted, in particular, to convert [[lead]] into [[gold]], for which purpose they used reactions of lead and lead-copper alloys with [[sulfur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weyer|first1=Jost|title=Neuere Interpretationsmglichkeiten der Alchemie|volume=7|pages=177|journal=Chemie in unserer Zeit|language=German|year=1973|doi=10.1002/ciuz.19730070604|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of chemical substances that do not normally occur in nature has long been tried, such as the synthesis of [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]]s attributed to the controversial alchemist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]]. The process involved heating of sulfate and nitrate minerals such as [[copper sulfate]], [[alum]] and [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]]. In the 17th century, [[Johann Rudolph Glauber]] produced [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sodium sulfate]] by reacting sulfuric acid and [[sodium chloride]]. With the development of the [[lead chamber process]] in 1746 and the [[Leblanc process]], allowing large-scale production of sulfuric acid and [[sodium carbonate]], respectively, chemical reactions became implemented into the industry. Further optimization of sulfuric acid technology resulted in the [[contact process]] in 1880s,&lt;ref&gt;Leonard J. Friedman &amp; Samantha J. Friedman [http://www.aiche-cf.org/Clearwater/2008/Paper2/8.2.7.pdf The History of the Contact Sulfuric Acid Process], Acid Engineering &amp; Consulting, Inc. Boca Raton, Florida&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Haber process]]  was developed in 1909–1910 for [[ammonia]] synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Lesch [http://books.google.com/books?id=VJIztvolC8cC&amp;pg=PA170 The German chemical industry in the twentieth century], Springer, 2000, ISBN 0792364872 p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 16th century, researchers including [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]], [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Isaac Newton]] tried to establish theories of the experimentally observed chemical transformations. The [[phlogiston theory]] was proposed in 1667 by [[J. J. Becher|Johann Joachim Becher]]. It postulated the existence of a fire-like element called &quot;phlogiston&quot;, which was contained within combustible bodies and released during [[combustion]]. This proved to be false in 1785 by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] who found the correct explanation of the combustion as reaction with oxygen from the air.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, pp. 34–55&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] recognized in 1808 that gases always react in a certain relationship with each other. Based on this idea and the atomic theory of [[John Dalton]], [[Joseph Proust]] had developed the [[law of definite proportions]], which later resulted in the concepts of [[stoichiometry]] and [[chemical equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, pp. 104–107&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the [[organic chemistry]], it was long believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were too complex to be obtained [[Chemical synthesis|synthetically]]. According to the concept of [[vitalism]], organic matter was endowed with a &quot;vital force&quot; and distinguished from inorganic materials. This separation was ended however by the synthesis of [[urea]] from inorganic precursors by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] in 1828. Other chemists who brought major contributions to organic chemistry include [[Alexander William Williamson]] with his [[Williamson ether synthesis|synthesis]] of [[ether]]s and [[Christopher Kelk Ingold]], who, among many discoveries, established the mechanisms of [[substitution reaction]]s.

==Equations==
[[Chemical equation]]s are used to graphically illustrate chemical reactions. They consist of [[chemical formula|chemical]] or [[structural formula]]s of the reactants on the left and those of the products on the right. They are separated by an arrow (→) which indicates the direction and type of the reaction. The tip of the arrow points in the direction in which the reaction proceeds. A double arrow ({{eqm}}) pointing in opposite directions is used for [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium reaction]]s. Equations should be balanced according to the [[stoichiometry]], the number of atoms of each species should be the same on both sides of the equation. This is achieved by scaling the number of involved molecules (''A, B, C'' and ''D'' in a schematic example below) by the appropriate integers ''a, b, c'' and ''d''.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=chemical reaction equation|file=C01034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{a\ A + b\ B \longrightarrow c\ C + d\ D}&lt;/math&gt;

More complex reactions are represented by reaction schemes, which in addition to starting materials and products show important intermediates or [[transition state]]s. Also, some relatively minor additions to the reaction can be indicated above the reaction arrow; examples of such additions are water, heat, illumination, a catalyst, etc. Similarly, some minor products can be placed below the arrow, often with a minus sign. 
[[File:Baeyer-Villiger-Oxidation-V1.svg|thumb|center|750px|An example of organic reaction: [[Baeyer–Villiger oxidation|oxidation]] of [[ketone]]s to [[ester]]s with [[Peroxy acid|peroxycarboxylic acid]]]]

[[Retrosynthetic analysis]] can be applied to design a complex synthesis reaction. Here the analysis starts from the products, for example by splitting selected chemical bonds, to arrive at plausible initial reagents. A special arrow (⇒) is used in retro reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corey|first1=E. J.|title=Robert Robinson Lecture. Retrosynthetic thinking?essentials and examples|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|volume=17|pages=111|year=1988|doi=10.1039/CS9881700111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elementary reactions==
The [[elementary reaction]] is the smallest division into which a chemical reaction can be decomposed to, it has no intermediate products.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=elementary reaction|file=E02035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most experimentally observed reactions are built up from many elementary reactions that occur in parallel or sequentially. The actual sequence of the individual elementary reactions is known as [[reaction mechanism]]. An elementary reaction involves a few molecules, usually one or two, because of the low probability for several molecules to meet at a certain time.&lt;ref&gt;Gernot Frenking: ''Elementarreaktionen.'' In: Römpp Chemie-Lexikon, Thieme, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Azobenzene isomerization de.svg|thumb|300px|Isomerization of [[azobenzene]], induced by light (hν) or heat (Δ)]]
The most important elementary reactions are unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. Only one molecule is involved in a unimolecular reaction; it is transformed by an isomerization or a [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] in one or more other molecules. Such reaction requires addition of energy in the form of heat or light. A typical example of a unimolecular reaction is the [[cis–trans isomerism|cis–trans]] [[isomerization]], in which the cis-form of a compound converts to the trans-form or vice versa.&lt;ref name=rh/&gt;

In a typical [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] reaction, a bond in a molecule splits resulting in two molecular fragments. The splitting can be [[Homolysis|homolytic]] or [[Heterolysis|heterolytic]]. In the first case, the bond is divided so that each product retains an electron and becomes a neutral [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]]. In the second case, both electrons of the chemical bond remain with one of the products, resulting in charged [[ion]]s. Dissociation plays an important role in triggering [[chain reaction]]s, such as [[Oxyhydrogen|hydrogen–oxygen]] or [[polymerization]] reactions.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AB \longrightarrow A + B}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;small&gt; Dissociation of a molecule AB into fragments A and B &lt;/small&gt;

For bimolecular reactions, two molecules collide and react with each other. Their merger is called  [[chemical synthesis]] or an [[addition reaction]].
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A + B \longrightarrow AB}&lt;/math&gt;
Another possibility is that only a portion of one molecule is transferred to the other molecule. This type of reaction occurs, for example, in redox and acid-base reactions. In redox reactions, the transferred particle is an electron, whereas in acid-base reactions it is a proton. This type of reaction is also called [[Metathesis reaction|metathesis]].
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{HA + B \longrightarrow A + HB}&lt;/math&gt;
for example
:[[Sodium Chloride|NaCl]]&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + [[Silver nitrate|AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; → [[Sodium nitrate|NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + [[Silver chloride|AgCl]]&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;

==Chemical equilibrium==
{{Main|Chemical equilibrium}}
Most chemical reactions are reversible, that is they can and do run in both directions. The forward and reverse reactions are competing with each other and differ in [[Chemical kinetics|reaction rates]]. These rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction: the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction, establishing the so-called chemical equilibrium. The time to reach equilibrium depends on such parameters as temperature, pressure and the materials involved, and is determined by the [[Principle of minimum energy|minimum free energy]]. In equilibrium, the [[Gibbs free energy]] must be zero. The pressure dependence can be explained with the [[Le Chatelier's principle]]. For example, an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer moles of gas.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction yield stabilized at equilibrium, but can be increased by removing the product from the reaction mixture or increasing temperature or pressure. Change in the initial concentrations of the substances does not affect the equilibrium.

==Thermodynamics==
Chemical reactions are largely determined by the laws of [[thermodynamics]]. Reactions can proceed by themselves if they are [[exergonic]], that is if they release energy. The associated free energy of the reaction is composed of two different thermodynamic quantities, [[enthalpy]] and [[entropy]]:&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, pp. 106–108&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\Delta G = \Delta H - T \cdot \Delta S}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;small&gt; G: free energy, H: enthalpy, T: temperature, S: entropy, Δ: difference &lt;/small&gt;

Reactions can be [[Exothermic reaction|exothermic]], where ΔH is negative and energy is released. Typical examples of exothermic reactions are [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] and [[crystallization]], in which ordered solids are formed from disordered gaseous or liquid phases. In contrast, in [[endothermic]] reactions, heat is consumed from the environment. This can occur by increasing the entropy of the system, often through the formation of gaseous reaction products, which have high entropy. Since the entropy increases with temperature, many endothermic reactions preferably take place at high temperatures. On the contrary, many exothermic reactions such as crystallization occur at low temperatures. Changes in temperature can sometimes reverse the direction of a reaction, as in the [[Boudouard reaction]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CO_2 + C \rightleftharpoons 2\ CO\ ; \quad \Delta H = +172.45\  kJ \cdot mol^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

This reaction between [[carbon dioxide]] and [[carbon]] to form [[carbon monoxide]] is endothermic at temperatures above approximately 800 °C and is exothermic below this temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Wiberg, pp. 810–811&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions can also be characterized with the [[internal energy]] which takes into account changes in the entropy, volume and [[chemical potential]]. The latter depends, among other things, on the [[activity (chemistry)|activities]] of the involved substances.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\, {d}S - p\, {d}V + \mu\, {d}n \!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;small&gt; U: internal energy, S: entropy, p: pressure, μ: chemical potential, n: number of molecules, d: [[differential calculus|small change sign]] &lt;/small&gt;

==Kinetics==
The speed at which a reactions takes place is studied by [[Chemical kinetics|reaction kinetics]]. The rate depends on various parameters, such as:

*[[Reactant]] concentrations, which usually make the reaction happen at a faster rate if raised through increased collisions per unit time. Some reactions, however, have rates that are ''independent'' of reactant concentrations.  These are called [[Rate law#Zero-order reactions|zero order reactions]].
*[[Surface area]] available for contact between the reactants, in particular solid ones in heterogeneous systems. Larger surface areas lead to higher reaction rates.
*[[Pressure]] – increasing the pressure decreases the volume between molecules and therefore increases the frequency of collisions between the molecules.
*[[Activation energy]], which is defined as the amount of energy required to make the reaction start and carry on spontaneously. Higher activation energy implies that the reactants need more energy to start than a reaction with a lower activation energy.
*[[Temperature]], which hastens reactions if raised, since higher temperature increases the energy of the molecules, creating more collisions per unit time,
*The presence or absence of a [[catalyst]]. Catalysts are substances which change the pathway (mechanism) of a reaction which in turn increases the speed of a reaction by lowering the [[activation energy]] needed for the reaction to take place. A catalyst is not destroyed or changed during a reaction, so it can be used again.
*For some reactions, the presence of [[electromagnetic radiation]], most notably [[ultraviolet light]], is needed to promote the breaking of bonds to start the reaction.  This is particularly true for reactions involving [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]].

Several theories allow calculating the reaction rates at the molecular level. This field is referred to as reaction dynamics. The rate ''v'' of a [[Rate equation#First-order reactions|first-order reaction]], which could be disintegration of a substance A, is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; v= -\frac {d[\mathrm{A}]}{dt}= k \cdot [\mathrm{A}] &lt;/math&gt;

Its integration yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{[A]}(t) = \mathrm{[A]}_{0} \cdot e^{-k\cdot t} &lt;/math&gt;

Here k is first-order rate constant having dimension 1/time, [A](t) is concentration at a time ''t'' and [A]&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial concentration. The rate of a first-order reaction depends only on the concentration and the properties of the involved substance, and the reaction itself can be described with the characteristic [[half-life]]. More than one time constant is needed when describing reactions of higher order. The temperature dependence of the rate constant usually follows the [[Arrhenius equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;k = k_0 e^{{-E_a}/{k_{B}T}}&lt;/math&gt;

where E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the activation energy and k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. One of the simplest models of reaction rate is the [[collision theory]]. More realistic models are tailored to a specific problem and include the [[transition state theory]], the calculation of the [[potential energy surface]], the [[Marcus theory]] and the [[RRKM theory|Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, p. 963&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction types==
===Oxidation and reduction===
[[File:redox reaction.png|thumb|right|Illustration of a redox reaction]]
[[File:Redox Halves.png|thumb|The two parts of a redox reaction]]
[[Redox]] reactions can be understood in terms of transfer of electrons from one involved species ([[reducing agent]]) to another ([[oxidizing agent]]). In this process, the former species is oxidized and the latter is reduced, thus the term ''redox''. Though sufficient for many purposes, these descriptions are not precisely correct. Oxidation is better defined as an increase in [[oxidation number]], and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number. In practice, the transfer of electrons will always change the oxidation number, but there are many reactions that are classed as &quot;redox&quot; even though no electron transfer occurs (such as those involving [[covalent]] bonds).&lt;ref&gt;Christian B. Anfinsen [http://books.google.com/books?id=HvARsi6S-b0C&amp;pg=PA7 Advances in protein chemistry], Academic Press, 1991 ISBN 0120342421 p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Sykes [http://books.google.com/books?id=qnRkjATn0YUC&amp;pg=PA359 Advances in Inorganic Chemistry, Volume 36], Academic Press, 1991 ISBN 0120236362 p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a redox reaction is:
:2 S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;
Here I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced to I&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; ([[thiosulfate]] anion) is oxidized to S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;.

Which of the involved reactants would be reducing or oxidizing agent can be predicted from the [[electronegativity]] of their elements. Elements with low electronegativity, such as most [[metal]]s, easily donate electrons and oxidize – they are reducing agents. On the contrary, many ions with high oxidation numbers, such as {{chem|link=hydrogen peroxide|H|2|O|2}}, {{chem|link=permanganate|MnO|4|-}}, {{chem|link=chromium trioxide|CrO|3}}, {{chem|link=dichromate|Cr|2|O|7|2-}}, {{chem|link=Osmium(VIII) oxide|OsO|4}}) can gain one or two extra electrons and are strong oxidizing agents.

The number of electrons donated or accepted in a redox reaction can be predicted from [[electron configuration]] of the reactant element. Elements are trying to reach the low-energy [[noble gas]] configuration, and therefore alkali metals and halogens will donate and accept one electron, respectively, and the noble gases themselves are chemically inactive.&lt;ref&gt;Wiberg, pp. 289–290&lt;/ref&gt;

An important class of redox reactions are the [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] reactions, where the electrons from the power supply are used as a reducing agent. These reactions are particularly important for the production of chemical elements, such as [[chlorine]]&lt;ref&gt;Wiberg, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt; or [[aluminium]]. The reverse process in which electrons are released in redox reactions and can be used as electrical energy is possible and is used in the batteries.

===Complexation===
[[File:Ferrocene-from-xtal-3D-balls.png|160px|thumb|[[Ferrocene]] – an iron atom sandwiched between two C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; [[ligand]]s]]
In complexation reactions, several [[ligand]]s react with a metal atom to form a [[coordination complex]]. This is achieved by providing [[lone pair]]s of the ligand into empty [[Atomic orbital|orbital]]s of the metal atom and forming [[dipolar bond]]s. The ligands are [[Lewis base]]s, they can be both ions and neutral molecules, such as carbon monoxide, ammonia or water. The number of ligands that react with a central metal atom can be found using the [[18-electron rule]], saying that the [[valence shell]]s of a [[transition metal]] will collectively accommodate 18 [[electron]]s, whereas the symmetry of the resulting complex can be predicted with the [[crystal field theory]] and [[ligand field theory]]. Complexation reactions also include [[ligand exchange]], in which one or more ligands are replaced by another, and redox processes which change the oxidation state of the central metal atom.&lt;ref&gt;Wiberg, pp. 1180–1205&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acid-base reactions===
[[Acid-base reaction]]s involve transfer of [[Protonation|protons]] from one molecule ([[acid]]) to another ([[Base (chemistry)|base]]). Here, [[acid]]s act as proton donors and [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] as acceptors.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{HA + B \rightleftharpoons A^- + HB^+}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;small&gt; Acid-base reaction, HA: acid, B: Base, A&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;: conjugated base, HB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: conjugated acid &lt;/small&gt;
The associated proton transfer results in the so-called [[conjugate acid]] and conjugate base.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=conjugate acid–base pair|file=C01266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse reaction is possible, and thus the acid/base and conjugated base/acid are always in equilibrium. The equilibrium is determined by the [[acid dissociation constant|acid and base dissociation constants]] (''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) of the involved substances. A special case of the acid-base reaction is the [[neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] where an acid and a base, taken at exactly same amounts, form a neutral [[salt]].

Acid-base reactions can have different definitions depending on the acid-base concept employed. Some of the most common are:
*[[Acid-base#Arrhenius definition|Arrhenius]] definition: Acids dissociate in water releasing H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions; bases dissociate in water releasing OH&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ions.
*[[Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory|Brønsted-Lowry]] definition: Acids are proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) donors, bases are proton acceptors; this includes the Arrhenius definition.
*[[Acid-base#Lewis definition|Lewis]] definition: Acids are electron-pair acceptors, bases are electron-pair donors; this includes the Brønsted-Lowry definition.

===Precipitation===
[[File:Chemical precipitation diagram.svg|thumb|Precipitation]]
[[Precipitation (chemistry)|Precipitation]] is the formation of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction. It usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the [[solubility]] limit&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=precipitation|file=P04795}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forms an insoluble salt. This process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by removal of the solvent. Rapid precipitation results in an [[amorphous]] or microcrystalline residue and slow process can yield single [[crystal]]s. The latter can also be obtained by [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] from microcrystalline salts.&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Wingender, Stefanie Ortanderl ''Ausfällung.'' In: ''Römpp Chemie-Lexikon.'', Thieme, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solid-state reactions===
Reactions can take place between two solids. However, because of the relatively small [[diffusion]] rates in solids, the corresponding chemical reactions are very slow. They are accelerated by increasing the reaction temperature and finely dividing the reactant to increase the contacting surface area.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Alsfasser, Erwin Riedel, C Janiak, HJ Meyer ''Modern Inorganic Chemistry.'' 3. Edition. de Gruyter, 2007, ISBN 978-3-1101-9060-1, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photochemical reactions===
[[File:Paterno-Buchi reaction.svg|thumb|In this [[Paterno–Büchi reaction]], a photoexcited carbonyl group is added to an unexcited [[olefin]], yielding an [[oxetane]].]]
In [[Photochemistry|photochemical reactions]], atoms and molecules absorb energy ([[photon]]s) of the illumination light and convert into an [[excited state]]. They can then release this energy by breaking chemical bonds, thereby producing radicals. Photochemical reactions include hydrogen–oxygen reactions, [[radical polymerization]], [[chain reaction]]s and [[rearrangement reaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, pp. 937–950&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many important processes involve photochemistry. The premier example is [[photosynthesis]], in which most plants use solar energy to convert [[carbon dioxide]] and water into [[glucose]], disposing of [[oxygen]] as a side-product. Humans rely on photochemistry for the formation of vitamin D, and [[visual perception|vision]] is initiated by a photochemical reaction of [[rhodopsin]].&lt;ref name=rh&gt;Christophe Dugave [http://books.google.com/books?id=udSCHPq5Ii0C&amp;pg=PA56 Cis-trans isomerization in biochemistry], Wiley-VCH, 2006 ISBN 3527313044 p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; In [[fireflies]], an [[enzyme]] in the abdomen catalyzes a reaction that results in [[bioluminescence]].&lt;ref&gt;David Stanley Saunders [http://books.google.com/books?id=3qJOw5Gh_UMC&amp;pg=PA179 Insect clocks], Elsevier, 2002, ISBN 0444504079 p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Many significant photochemical reactions, such as ozone formation, occur in the Earth atmosphere and constitute [[atmospheric chemistry]].

==Catalysis==
[[File:Activation energy.svg|thumb|right|Schematic potential energy diagram showing the effect of a catalyst in an endothermic chemical reaction. The presence of a catalyst opens a different reaction pathway (in red) with a lower activation energy. The final result and the overall thermodynamics are the same.]]
[[File:Pot catalytique vue de la structure.jpg|thumb|Solid heterogeneous catalysts are plated on meshes in ceramic [[catalytic converter]]s in order to maximize their surface area. This exhaust converter is from a [[Peugeot 106]] S2 1100]]

In [[catalysis]], the reaction does not proceed directly, but through a third substance known as [[catalyst]]. Unlike other reagents that participate in the chemical reaction, a catalyst is not consumed by the reaction itself; however, it can be inhibited, deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes. Catalysts can be used in a different phase ([[heterogeneous catalysis|heterogeneous]]) or in the same phase ([[homogenous catalysis|homogenous]]) as the reactants. In heterogeneous catalysis, typical secondary processes include [[coking]] where the catalyst becomes covered by [[polymer]]ic side products. Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid-liquid system or evaporate in a solid-gas system. Catalysts can only speed up the reaction – chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=catalyst|file=C00876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=inhibitor|file=I03035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons. With a catalyst, a reaction which is kinetically inhibited by a high activation energy can take place in circumvention of this activation energy.

Heterogeneous catalysts are usually solids, powdered in order to maximize their surface area. Of particular importance in heterogeneous catalysis are the [[platinum group]] metals and other transition metals, which are used in [[hydrogenation]]s, [[catalytic reforming]] and in the synthesis of commodity chemicals such as [[nitric acid]] and [[ammonia]]. Acids are an example of a homogeneous catalyst, they increase the nucleophilicity of [[carbonyl]]s, allowing a reaction that would not otherwise proceed with electrophiles. The advantage of homogeneous catalysts is the ease of mixing them with the reactants, but they may also be difficult to separate from the products. Therefore, heterogeneous catalysts are preferred in many industrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Elschenbroich: ''Organometallchemie.'' 6th edition, Wiesbaden, 2008, ISBN 978-3-8351-0167-8, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions in organic chemistry==
In organic chemistry, in addition to oxidation, reduction or acid-base reactions, a number of other reactions can take place which involve [[covalent bond]]s between carbon atoms or carbon and [[heteroatom]]s (such as oxygen, nitrogen, [[halogen]]s, etc.). Many specific reactions in organic chemistry are [[name reaction]]s designated after their discoverers.

===Substitution===
In a [[substitution reaction]], a [[functional group]] in a particular [[chemical compound]] is replaced by another group.&lt;ref name=jerry&gt;{{JerryMarch}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reactions can be distinguished by the type of substituting species into a [[nucleophilic substitution|nucleophilic]], [[electrophilic substitution|electrophilic]] or [[radical substitution]]. 

In the first type, a [[nucleophile]], an atom or molecule with an excess of electrons and thus a negative charge or [[partial charge]], replaces another atom or part of the &quot;substrate&quot; molecule. The electron pair from the nucleophile attacks the substrate forming a new bond, while the [[leaving group]] departs with an electron pair. The nucleophile may be electrically neutral or negatively charged, whereas the substrate is typically neutral or positively charged. Examples of nucleophiles are [[hydroxide]] ion, [[alkoxide]]s, [[amine]]s and [[halide]]s. This type of reaction is found mainly in [[aliphatic hydrocarbon]]s, and rarely in [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]. The latter have high electron density and enter [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] only with very strong [[Polar effect|electron withdrawing groups]]. Nucleophilic substitution can take place by two different mechanisms, [[SN1 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1]] and [[SN2 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2]]. In their names, S stands for substitution, N for nucleophilic, and the number represents the [[order (chemistry)|kinetic order]] of the reaction, unimolecular or bimolecular.&lt;ref&gt;S. R. Hartshorn, [http://books.google.com/books?id=bAo4AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Aliphatic Nucleophilic Substitution''], Cambridge University Press, London, 1973. ISBN 0-521-09801-7 pp. 1 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|left|SN1 reaction mechanism.png|273|SN2 reaction mechanism.png|375|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1  mechanism|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 mechanism}}

|caption2=S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction causes stereo inversion (Walden inversion)
}}

The S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 reaction proceeds in two steps. First, the [[leaving group]] is eliminated creating a [[carbocation]]. This is followed by a rapid reaction with the nucleophile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author =  Leslie C. Bateman, Mervyn G. Church, Edward D. Hughes, Christopher K. Ingold and Nazeer Ahmed Taher|doi = 10.1039/JR9400000979|title =  188. Mechanism of substitution at a saturated carbon atom. Part XXIII. A kinetic demonstration of the unimolecular solvolysis of alkyl halides. (Section E) a general discussion|year =  1940|journal =  Journal of the Chemical Society|pages =  979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 mechanism, the nucleophile forms a transition state with the attacked molecule, and only then the leaving group is cleaved. These two mechanisms differ in the [[stereochemistry]] of the products. S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 leads to the non-stereospecific addition and does not result in a chiral center, but rather in a set of [[Cis–trans isomerism|geometric isomers]] (''cis/trans''). In contrast, a reversal ([[Walden inversion]]) of the previously existing stereochemistry is observed in the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Brückner, pp. 63–77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electrophilic substitution]] is the counterpart of the nucleophilic substitution in that the attacking atom or molecule, an [[electrophile]], has low electron density and thus a positive charge. Typical electrophiles are the carbon atom of [[carbonyl group]]s, carbocations or [[sulfur]] or [[nitronium]] cations. This reaction takes place almost exclusively in aromatic hydrocarbons, where it is called [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]]. The electrophile attack results in the so-called σ-complex, a transition state in which the aromatic system is abolished. Then, the leaving group, usually a proton, is split off and the aromaticity is restored. An alternative to aromatic substitution is electrophilic aliphatic substitution. It is similar to the nucleophilic aliphatic substitution and also has two major types, S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;1 and S&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;ref&gt;Brückner, pp. 203–206&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Electrophilic aromatic substitution.svg|center|thumb|648px|Mechanism of electrophilic aromatic substitution]]
{{clear}}
In the third type of substitution reaction, radical substitution, the attacking particle is a [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]].&lt;ref name=jerry/&gt; This process usually takes the form of a [[chain reaction]], for example in the reaction of alkanes with halogens. In the first step, light or heat disintegrates the halogen-containing molecules producing the radicals. Then the reaction proceeds as an avalanche until two radicals meet and recombine.&lt;ref&gt;Brückner, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{X{\cdot} + R{-}H \longrightarrow X{-}H + R{\cdot}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R{\cdot} + X_2 \longrightarrow R{-}X + X{\cdot}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;small&gt; Reactions during the chain reaction of radical substitution &lt;/small&gt;

===Addition and elimination===

The [[Addition reaction|addition]] and its counterpart, the [[elimination reaction|elimination]], are reactions which change the number of substituents on the carbon atom, and form or cleave [[covalent bond|multiple bond]]s. [[Double bond|Double]] and [[triple bond]]s can be produced by eliminating a suitable leaving group. Similar to the nucleophilic substitution, there are several possible reaction mechanisms which are named after the respective reaction order. In the E1 mechanism, the leaving group is ejected first, forming a carbocation. The next step, formation of the double bond, takes place with elimination of a proton ([[deprotonation]]). The leaving order is reversed in the E1cb mechanism, that is the proton is split off first. This mechanism requires participation of a base.&lt;ref&gt;Brückner, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the similar conditions, both reactions in the E1 or E1cb elimination always compete with the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 substitution.&lt;ref&gt;Brückner, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E2-mechanism.svg|thumb|300px|E2 elimination]]

The E2 mechanism also requires a base, but there the attack of the base and the elimination of the leaving group proceed simultaneously and produce no ionic intermediate. In contrast to the E1 eliminations, different stereochemical configurations are possible for the reaction product in the E2 mechanism, because the attack of the base preferentially occurs in the anti-position with respect to the leaving group. Because of the similar conditions and reagents, the E2 elimination is always in competition with the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2-substitution.&lt;ref&gt;Brückner, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HBr-Addition.png|thumb|300px|Electrophilic addition of hydrogen bromide]]
The counterpart of elimination is the addition where double or triple bonds are converted into single bonds. Similar to the substitution reactions, there are several types of additions distinguished by the type of the attacking particle. For example, in the [[electrophilic addition]] of hydrogen bromide, an electrophile (proton) attacks the double bond forming a [[carbocation]], which then reacts with the nucleophile (bromine). The carbocation can be formed on either side of the double bond depending on the groups attached to its ends, and the preferred configuration can be predicted with the [[Markovnikov's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiberg, pp. 950, 1602&lt;/ref&gt; This rule states that &quot;In the heterolytic addition of a polar molecule to an alkene or alkyne, the more electronegative (nucleophilic) atom (or part) of the polar molecule becomes attached to the carbon atom bearing the smaller number of hydrogen atoms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Markownikoff rule|file=M03707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the addition of a functional group takes place at the less substituted carbon atom of the double bond, then the electrophilic substitution with acids is not possible. In this case, one has to use the [[hydroboration–oxidation reaction]], where in the first step, the [[boron]] atom acts as electrophile and adds to the less substituted carbon atom. At the second step, the nucleophilic [[hydroperoxide]] or halogen [[anion]] attacks the boron atom.&lt;ref&gt;Brückner, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

While the addition to the electron-rich alkenes and alkynes is mainly electrophilic, the [[nucleophilic addition]] plays an important role for the carbon-heteroatom multiple bonds, and especially its most important representative, the carbonyl group. This process is often associated with an elimination, so that after the reaction the carbonyl group is present again. It is therefore called addition-elimination reaction and may occur in carboxylic acid derivatives such as chlorides, esters or anhydrides. This reaction is often catalyzed by acids or bases, where the acids increase by the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group by binding to the oxygen atom, whereas the bases enhance the nucleophilicity of the attacking nucleophile.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Peter Latscha, Uli Kazmaier, Helmut Alfons Klein ''Organische Chemie: Chemie-basiswissen II, Vol. 2.'' 6th edition, Springer, 2008, ISBN 978-3-5407-7106-7, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

{{clear}}

[[Nucleophilic addition]] of a [[carbanion]] or another [[nucleophile]] to the double bond of an [[Α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound|alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl compound]] can proceed via the [[Michael reaction]], which belongs to the larger class of [[conjugate addition]]s. This is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of C-C bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|doi=10.1002/0471264180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Chapter 18: Enols and Enolates — The Michael Addition reaction|author = Ian Hunt|publisher = University of Calgary|url = http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/351/Carey5th/Ch18/ch18-4-3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brückner, p. 580&lt;/ref&gt;

Some additions which can not be executed with nucleophiles and electrophiles, can be succeeded with free radicals. As with the free-radical substitution, the [[radical addition]] proceeds as a chain reaction, and such reactions are the basis of the [[Radical polymerization|free-radical polymerization]].&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Lechner, Klaus Gehrke, Eckhard Nordmeier ''Macromolecular Chemistry'' 3rd Edition, Birkhauser, Basel 2003, ISBN 3-7643-6952-3, pp. 53–65&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[rearrangement reaction]], the carbon skeleton of a [[molecule]] is rearranged to give a [[structural isomer]] of the original molecule. These include [[Sigmatropic reaction|hydride shift]] reactions such as the [[Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement]], where a [[hydrogen]], [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]] group migrates from one carbon to a neighboring carbon. Most rearrangements are associated with the breaking and formation of new carbon-carbon bonds. Other examples are [[sigmatropic reaction]] such as the [[Cope rearrangement]].&lt;ref&gt;Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell [http://books.google.com/books?id=xx_uIP5LgO8C&amp;pg=PA699 Organic chemistry], 2004, ISBN 0763721972 p. 699&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyclic rearrangements include [[cycloaddition]]s and, more generally, [[pericyclic reaction]]s, wherein two or more double bond-containing molecules form a cyclic molecule. An important example of cycloaddition reaction is the [[Diels–Alder reaction]] (the so-called [4+2] cycloaddition) between a conjugated [[diene]] and a substituted [[alkene]] to form a substituted [[cyclohexene]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Diels|first1=Otto|last2=Alder|first2=Kurt|title=Synthesen in der hydroaromatischen Reihe|journal=Justus Liebig's Annalen der Chemie|volume=460|pages=98|year=1928|doi=10.1002/jlac.19284600106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether or not a certain cycloaddition would proceed depends on the electronic orbitals of the participating species, as only orbitals with the same sign of [[wave function]] will overlap and interact constructively to form new bonds. Cycloaddition is usually assisted by light or heat. These perturbations result in different arrangement of electrons in the excited state of the involved molecules and therefore in different effects. For example, the [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions can be assisted by heat whereas the [2+2] cycloaddition is selectively induced by light.&lt;ref&gt;Brückner, pp. 637–647&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the orbital character, the potential for developing [[stereochemistry|stereoisomeric]] products upon cycloaddition is limited, as described by the [[Woodward-Hoffmann rules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woodward|first1=R. B.|last2=Hoffmann|first2=Roald|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=87|pages=395|year=1965|doi=10.1021/ja01080a054|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biochemical reactions==
[[File:Induced fit diagram.svg|thumb|left|380px|Illustration of the induced fit model of enzyme activity]]
[[Biochemistry|Biochemical reactions]] are mainly controlled by [[enzymes]]. These [[protein]]s can specifically [[Enzyme catalysis|catalyze]] a single reaction, so that reactions can be controlled very precisely. The reaction takes place in the [[active site]], a small part of the enzyme which is usually found in a cleft or pocket lined by [[amino acid]] residues, and the rest of the enzyme is used mainly for stabilization. The catalytic action of enzymes relies on several mechanisms including the molecular shape (&quot;induced fit&quot;), bond strain, proximity and orientation of molecules relative to the enzyme, proton donation or withdrawal (acid/base catalysis), electrostatic interactions and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Karlson , Detlef Doenecke, Jan Koolman, Georg Fuchs, Wolfgang Gerok. ''Karlson Biochemistry and Pathobiochemistry,'' 16th edition, Georg Thieme, 2005, ISBN 978-3-1335-7815-8, pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;

The biochemical reactions that occur in living organisms are collectively known as [[metabolism]]. Among the most important of its mechanisms is the [[anabolism]], in which different [[DNA]] and enzyme-controlled processes result in the production of large molecules such as [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrates]] from smaller units.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=anabolism|file=A00314}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bioenergetics]] studies the sources of energy for such reactions. An important energy source is [[glucose]], which can be produced by plants via [[photosynthesis]] or assimilated from food. All organisms use this energy to produce [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), which can then be used to energize other reactions.

==Applications==
[[File:Velp-thermitewelding-1.jpg|thumb|Thermite reaction proceeding in railway welding. Shortly after this, the liquid iron flows into the mould around the rail gap]]
Chemical reactions are central to [[chemical engineering]] where they are used for the synthesis of new compounds from natural raw materials such as [[petroleum]] and mineral [[ore]]s. It is essential to make the reaction as efficient as possible, maximizing the yield and minimizing the amount of reagents, energy inputs and waste. [[Catalyst]]s are especially helpful for reducing the energy required for the reaction and increasing its [[reaction rate]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Emig, Elias Klemm. Technical Chemistry. 5th edition, Springer, 2005, ISBN 978-3-5402-3452-4, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trost|first1=B.|title=The atom economy—a search for synthetic efficiency|journal=Science|volume=254|pages=1471|year=1991|doi=10.1126/science.1962206|issue=5037|pmid=1962206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some specific reactions have their niche applications. For example, the [[thermite]] reaction is used to generate light and heat in [[pyrotechnics]] and [[welding]]. Although it is less controllable than the more conventional [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|oxy-fuel welding]], [[arc welding]] and [[flash welding]], it requires much less equipment and is still used to mend rails, especially in remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;John J. McKetta, Guy E Weismantel [http://books.google.com/books?id=MfjDlUe8Kc0C&amp;pg=PA109 Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design: Volume 67 – Water and Wastewater Treatment: Protective Coating Systems to Zeolite, Volume 67], CRC Press, 1999 ISBN 0824726189, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring==
Mechanisms of monitoring chemical reactions depend strongly on the reaction rate. Relatively slow processes can be analyzed in situ for the concentrations and identities of the individual ingredients. Important tools of real time analysis are the measurement of [[pH]] and analysis of optical absorption (color) and emission spectra. A less accessible but rather efficient method is introduction of a radioactive isotope into the reaction and monitoring how it changes over time and where it moves to; this method is often used to analyze redistribution of substances in the human body. Faster reactions are usually studied with [[ultrafast laser spectroscopy]] where utilization of [[Femtochemistry|femtosecond]] [[laser]]s allows short-lived transition states to be monitored  at time scaled down to a few femtoseconds.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, p. 987&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Canal do Cassiquiare.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of the Cassiquiare canal based on [[Alexander von Humboldt]], 1799 observations.]]
The '''Casiquiare  river'''  is a [[distributary]] of the upper [[Orinoco River|Orinoco]], which flows southward into the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)| Rio Negro]], in South America. As such, it forms a unique natural canal between the Orinoco and [[Amazon River|Amazon]] river systems. It is the largest river on the planet that links two major river systems, a so-called [[bifurcation (river)|bifurcation]]. The area forms a [[Casiquiare canal-Orinoco River hydrographic divide|water divide]], more dramatically at regional [[flood]] stage. Another river that links two river basins is the [[Echimamish River]] in Canada.

==Discovery==

In 1744 a [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] priest named Father Roman, while ascending the [[Orinoco River]], met some [[Portugal|Portuguese]] slave-traders from the settlements on the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]]. He accompanied them on their return, by way of the Casiquiare canal, and afterwards retraced his route to the Orinoco. [[Charles Marie de La Condamine|La Condamine]], seven months later, was able to give to the ''[[Académie française]]'' an account of Father Roman's voyage, and thus confirm the existence of this waterway, first reported by [[Cristóbal Diatristán de Acuña|Father Acuña]] in 1639.

But little credence was given to Father Roman's statement until it was verified, in 1756, by the [[Spain|Spanish]] Boundary-line Commission of [[Yturriaga and Solano]]. In 1800 German scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and French botanist [[Aimé Bonpland]] explored the river.  During the 1924-25 [[Alexander H. Rice, Jr.]] expedition of [[Harvard University]], he traveled up the Orinoco, traversed the Casiquiare canal, and descended the Rio Negro to the Amazon at Manaus. It was the first expedition to use aerial photography and [[shortwave radio]] for mapping of the region.  In 1968 the Casiquiare was navigated by an [[SRN6 hovercraft]] during a [[National Geographic]] expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Graham Clarke|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1565257/Graham-Clarke.html|work= [[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher= |date= 2007-10-07|accessdate=2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

The origin of Casiquiare, at the River Orinoco, is {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} below the mission of [[La Esmeralda]] at {{coord|3|8|18.5|N|65|52|42.5|W|region:VE-X_type:landmark|display=inline}}, and is about {{convert|123|m|ft|0}} above sea level. Its mouth at the Rio Negro, an affluent of the [[Amazon River]], is near the town of [[San Carlos de Río Negro|San Carlos]] and is {{convert|91|m|ft|0}} above sea level.

The general course is south-west, and its length, including windings, is about {{convert|200|mi|km|-1}}. Its width, at its [[river bifurcation|bifurcation]] with the Orinoco, is approximately {{convert|300|ft|m|-1}}, with a current towards the Rio Negro of {{convert|0.75|mph|m/s|1|lk=on}}. However, as it gains in volume from the very numerous [[tributary]] streams, large and small, which it receives en route, its velocity increases, and in the wet season reaches {{convert|5|mph|m/s|1}}, even {{convert|8|mph|m/s|1}} in certain stretches. It broadens considerably as it approaches its mouth, where it is about {{convert|1750|ft|m|adj=mid|wide|abbr=on|0}}. The volume of water the Casiquiare captures from the Orinoco is small in comparison to what it accumulates in its course.

In [[flood]]-time it is said to have a second connection with the Rio Negro by a branch, which it throws off to the westward, called the [[Itinivini]], which leaves it at a point about {{convert|50|mi|km|-1}} above its mouth. In the dry season, it has shallows, and is obstructed by sandbanks, a few rapids and granite rocks. Its shores are densely wooded, and the soil more fertile than that along the Rio Negro. The general slope of the plains through which the canal runs is south-west, but those of the Rio Negro slope south-east.

The Casiquiare is not a sluggish canal on a flat tableland, but a great, rapid river which, if its upper waters had not found contact with the Orinoco, perhaps by cutting back, would belong entirely to the Negro branch of the Amazon.

To the west of the Casiquiare, there is a much shorter and more facile [[connexion]] between the Orinoco and Amazon basins, called the isthmus of [[Pimichin]], which is reached by ascending the Terni branch of the [[Atabapo]] affluent of the Orinoco. Although the Terni is somewhat obstructed, it is believed that it could easily be made navigable for small craft. The isthmus is {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=mid|across|abbr=on|0}}, with undulating ground, nowhere over {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|high|abbr=on|0}}, with swamps and marshes. It is much used for the transit of large canoes, which are hauled across it from the Terni river, and which reach the Rio Negro by the little stream called the Pimichin.

==Hydrographic divide==
The ''Casiquiare canal-Orinoco River hydrographic divide'' is a representation of the [[hydrography|hydrographic]] [[water divide]] that delineates the separation between the ''Orinoco Basin'' from the ''[[Amazon Basin]]''. (The Orinoco Basin is west&amp;ndash;north&amp;ndash;northeast flowing, into the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]]; the Amazon Basin is east-flowing into the western [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], extreme northeast [[Brazil]]).

Essentially the [[water divide|river divide]], is a west-flowing, upriver section of Venezuela's [[Orinoco River]] with an outflow to the south into the Amazon Basin. This named outflow is the Casiquiare canal, which as it heads downstream-(southerly), picks up speed and also accumulates water volume.

The greatest manifestation of the divide is at flooding. During flood stage, the Casiquiare's main outflow point into the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] is supplemented by an overflow that is a second, and more minor entry river [[River bifurcation|bifurcation]] into the Rio Negro and upstream from its major, common low-water entry confluence with the Rio Negro. At flood, the river becomes an area flow source, far more than a narrow confined river.

The Casiquiare canal connects the upper Orinoco, 9 miles below the mission of Esmeraldas, with the Rio Negro affluent of the [[Amazon River]] near the town of [[San Carlos de Río Negro|San Carlos]].

The simplest description-(besides the entire area-floodpain) of the water divide is a ''&quot;south-bank Orinoco River strip&quot;'' at the exit point of the Orinoco, also the ''origin'' of the Casiquiare canal. However during the Orinoco's flood stage, that single, simply defined ''origin of the canal'', is turned into a region, and an ''entire strip along the southern bank of the Orinoco River''.

The '''Capetian dynasty''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|ə|ˈ|p|iː|ʃ|ⁱ|ən}}) is the largest and oldest European [[royal house]], consisting of the descendants of [[Hugh Capet of France]] in the male line and of the [[Merovingian dynasty]] and the [[Carolingian dynasty]] in the female line. In contemporary times, both King [[Juan Carlos]] of Spain and Grand Duke [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Henri]] of [[Luxembourg]] are members of this family, both through the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon branch]] of the dynasty.

==Name origins and usage==
The name of the dynasty derives from its founder, [[Hugh Capet of France|Hugh]], who was known as &quot;Hugh Capet&quot;. The meaning of &quot;Capet&quot; (a nickname rather than a surname of the modern sort) is unknown. While folk etymology identifies it with &quot;cape&quot;, other suggestions suggest it to be connected to the Latin word ''caput'' (&quot;head&quot;), and thus explain it as meaning &quot;chief&quot; or &quot;big head&quot;.{{citation}}

The name &quot;Capetian&quot; came to be applied to both the ruling house of France, and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet, by historians. It was not a contemporary practice. The name &quot;Capet&quot; has also been used as a surname for French royals, particularly but not exclusively those of the [[House of Capet]] &amp;ndash; one notable use was during the French Revolution, when the dethroned King Louis XVI (a member of the [[House of Bourbon]], though a direct male-line descendant of Hugh Capet) and [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Queen Marie Antoinette]] (a member of the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]]) were referred to as &quot;Louis and Antoinette Capet&quot; (the Queen being addressed as &quot;the Widow Capet&quot; after the execution of her husband).

==The Robertians and before==
{{Capetian Cadets}}
{{main|Robertians}}
The dynastic surname now used to describe Hugh Capet's family prior to his election as King of France is &quot;Robertians&quot; or &quot;Robertines.&quot; The name is derived from the family's first certain ancestor, [[Robert the Strong]] (b. 820), the count of Paris. Robert was probably son of [[Robert III of Worms]] (b. 800) and grandson of [[Robert of Hesbaye]] (b. 770). The Robertians probably originated in the county [[Hesbaye]], around [[Tongeren]] in modern-day Belgium.

The sons of Robert the Strong were [[Odo of France|Odo]] and [[Robert I of France|Robert]], who both ruled as king of [[Western Francia]].  The family became [[Paris|Counts of Paris]] under Odo and Dukes of the [[Franks]] under Robert, possessing large parts of [[Neustria]].

The Carolingian dynasty ceased to rule France upon the death of [[Louis V of France|Louis V]].  After the death of Louis V, the son of Hugh the Great, [[Hugh Capet]], was elected by the nobility as king of France.  Hugh was crowned at [[Noyon]] on July 3, 987 with the full support from [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]].  With Hugh's coronation, a new era began for France, and his descendants came to be named the ''Capetians'', with the Capetian dynasty ruling France for more than eight hundred years (987–1848, with some interruptions&lt;ref&gt;Specific periods of reign are 888–898, 922–923, 987–1792, 1814–1815, and 1815–1848 – the over 800 year uninterrupted period 987–1792 forming the bulk.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Capetians through history==
Over the succeeding centuries, Capetians spread throughout Europe, ruling every form of provincial unit from [[monarchy|kingdoms]] to [[Manorialism|manor]]s.

===Salic Law===
[[Salic Law]], reestablished during the [[Hundred Years' War]] from an ancient [[Salian Franks|Frankish]] tradition, caused the French monarchy to permit only male [[Agnatic succession|agnatic]] descendants of Hugh to succeed to the throne of France.  

Without Salic Law, upon the death of [[John I of France|John I]], the crown would have passed to his half-sister, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]] (later Joan II of Navarre). However, Joan's paternity was suspect due to her mother's adultery; the French magnates adopted Salic Law to avoid the succession of a possible bastard.

In 1328, King [[Charles IV of France]] died without male heirs, as his brothers did before him. At that time, the only living male heir of King [[Philip IV of France]] was King [[Edward III of England]], son of Isabella of France, Philip's daughter. The French lords were opposed to the succession of an English monarch, and produced an addition to the Salic Law whereby a male heir cannot succeed to the throne through a female line.

Thus instead of the above succession, the French crown passed from the [[House of Capet]] after the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] to [[Philip VI of France]] of the [[House of Valois]], a [[cadet branch]] of the Capetian dynasty, 
*then to Louis XII of Valois-Orléans, a cadet line of the Valois, 
*then to Francis of Angoulème (who became Francis I), belonging to a cadet line of the Valois-Orléans,
*then to Henry of Navarre (who became Henry IV of France), from the [[House of Bourbon]], a cadet line of the Capetian Dynasty.

This did not affect monarchies not under that law such as Portugal, Spain, [[Navarre]], and various smaller duchies and counties.  Therefore, many royal families appear and disappear in the French succession or become cadet branches upon marriage.  A complete list of the senior-most line of Capetians is available [[#Senior Capets|below]].

==Senior Capets==
Throughout most of history, the '''Senior Capet''' and the [[King of France]] were synonymous terms.  Only in the time before [[Hugh Capet]] took the crown for himself and after the reign of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] is the term necessary to identify which.  However, since the [[Salic Law]] provided for the succession of the French throne for most of French history, here is a list of all the predecessors of the French monarchy, all the French kings from Hugh until Charles, and all the [[Legitimist]] pretenders thereafter.  All dates are for seniority, not reign. It is important to note that historians class the predecessors of Hugh Capet as ''Robertians'', not ''Capetians''.

==The Capetian dynasty today==
Many years have passed since the Capetian monarchs ruled a large part of Europe; however, they still remain as kings, as well as other titles. Currently two Capetian monarchs still rule in Spain and Luxembourg. In addition, seven [[pretender]]s represent exiled dynastic monarchies in Brazil, France, Spain, Portugal, Parma and Two Sicilies. The current legitimate, although [[morganatic]], senior family member is [[Louis-Alphonse, Duc d'Anjou|Louis Alfonso de Borbón]], known by his supporters as [[Duke of Anjou]], who also holds the [[Legitimist]] (''[[Blancs d'Espagne]]'') claim to the French throne. Overall, dozens of branches of the Capetian dynasty still exist throughout Europe.

Except for the House of Braganza (founded by an [[Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza|illegitimate son]] of King [[John I of Portugal|John I]], who was himself illegitimate), all current major Capetian branches are of the Bourbon cadet branch. Within the House of Bourbon, many of these lines are themselves well-defined cadet lines of the House.

===Current Capetian rulers===
* [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]], [[King of Spain]] (since 1975)
* [[Henri of Luxembourg|Henri]], [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] (since 2000)

===Current Capetian pretenders===
* [[Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria]], pretender to the [[Two Sicilies]] since 1964.
* [[Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro]], pretender to the [[Two Sicilies]] since  2008, upon the death of his father, [[Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Castro]].
* [[Carlos, Duke of Parma]], pretender to Parma since 2010.
* [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma]], [[Carlist]] pretender to Spain since 1979.
* [[Henri, comte de Paris, duc de France|Prince Henry, Count of Paris]], [[Legitimist]] (''Blancs d'Eu'') and [[Orléanist]] pretender to France since 1999.
* [[Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou]], [[Legitimist]] (''[[Blancs d'Espagne]]'') pretender to France since 1989.
* [[Prince Luís of Orléans-Braganza]], pretender to Brazil since 1981.
* [[Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza]], pretender to Portugal since 1976.

In [[geometry]], a '''cuboctahedron''' is a [[polyhedron]] with eight triangular faces and six square faces.  A cuboctahedron has 12 identical vertices, with two triangles and two squares meeting at each, and 24 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a square.  As such it is a [[quasiregular polyhedron]], i.e. an [[Archimedean solid]], being [[vertex-transitive]] and [[edge-transitive]].

Its [[dual polyhedron]] is the [[rhombic dodecahedron]].

== Other names ==
* ''Heptaparallelohedron'' ([[Buckminster Fuller]])&lt;ref name=dy&gt;http://dymaxion.org/dymaxion.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
** Fuller applied the name &quot;[[Dymaxion]]&quot;&lt;ref name=dy /&gt; and ''Vector Equilibrium''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/mt/marksomers/92.html&lt;/ref&gt; to this shape, used in an early version of the [[Dymaxion map]].
* With '''O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''' symmetry, it is a ''[[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] [[cube]]'' or ''rectified octahedron'' ([[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]])
* With '''T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''' symmetry, it is a ''[[Cantellation (geometry)|cantellated]] [[tetrahedron]]''.
* With '''D&lt;sub&gt;3d&lt;/sub&gt;''' symmetry, it is a ''triangular [[gyrobicupola]]''.

== Area and volume ==
The area ''A'' and the volume ''V'' of the cuboctahedron of edge length ''a'' are:
:&lt;math&gt;A = (6+2\sqrt{3})a^2 \approx  9.4641016a^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{5}{3} \sqrt{2}a^3 \approx 2.3570226a^3.&lt;/math&gt;

== Cartesian coordinates ==
The [[Cartesian coordinates]] for the vertices of a cuboctahedron (of edge length √2) centered at the origin are:
: (&amp;plusmn;1,&amp;plusmn;1,0)
: (&amp;plusmn;1,0,&amp;plusmn;1)
: (0,&amp;plusmn;1,&amp;plusmn;1)

An alternate set of coordinates can be made in 4-space, as 12 permutations of:
: (0,1,1,2)

This construction exists as one of 16 [[orthant]] [[Facet (geometry)|facets]] of the [[cantellated 16-cell]].

=== Root vectors ===
The cuboctahedron's 12 vertices can represent the root vectors of the [[simple Lie group]] A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. With the addition of 6 vertices of the [[octahedron]], these vertices represent the 18 root vectors [[simple Lie group]] B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Geometric relations ==

A cuboctahedron can be obtained by taking an appropriate [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of a four-dimensional [[16-cell]].

A cuboctahedron has octahedral symmetry.  Its first [[stellation]] is the [[polyhedral compound|compound]] of a [[cube (geometry)|cube]] and its dual [[octahedron]], with the vertices of the cuboctahedron located at the midpoints of the edges of either. 

The cuboctahedron is a [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] [[cube]] and also a rectified [[octahedron]]. 

It is also a [[Cantellation (geometry)|cantellated]] [[tetrahedron]]. With this construction it is given the [[Wythoff symbol]]: '''3&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;2'''. [[Image:Cantellated tetrahedron.png|50px]]

A skew cantellation of the tetrahedron produces a solid with faces parallel to those of the cuboctahedron, namely eight triangles of two sizes, and six rectangles.  While its edges are unequal, this solid remains ''vertex-uniform'': the solid has the full tetrahedral [[symmetry group]] and its vertices are equivalent under that group.

The edges of a cuboctahedron form four regular [[hexagon]]s.  If the cuboctahedron is cut in the plane of one of these hexagons, each half is a [[triangular cupola]], one of the [[Johnson solid]]s; the cuboctahedron itself thus can also be called a triangular [[bicupola (geometry)|gyrobicupola]], the simplest of a series (other than the [[gyrobifastigium]] or &quot;digonal gyrobicupola&quot;).  If the halves are put back together with a twist, so that triangles meet triangles and squares meet squares, the result is another Johnson solid, the [[triangular orthobicupola]].

Both triangular bicupolae are important in [[sphere packing]]. The distance from the solid's centre to its vertices is equal to its edge length. Each central [[sphere]] can have up to twelve neighbors, and in a face-centered cubic lattice these take the positions of a cuboctahedron's vertices.  In a [[hexagon]]al close-packed lattice they correspond to the corners of the triangular orthobicupola. In both cases the central sphere takes the position of the solid's centre.

Cuboctahedra appear as cells in three of the [[convex uniform honeycomb]]s and in nine of the convex [[uniform polychoron|uniform polychora]].

The volume of the cuboctahedron is 5/6 of that of the enclosing cube and 5/8 of that of the enclosing octahedron.

The cuboctahedron shares its edges and vertex arrangement with two [[nonconvex uniform polyhedron|nonconvex uniform polyhedra]]: the [[cubohemioctahedron]] (having the square faces in common) and the [[octahemioctahedron]] (having the triangular faces in common). It also serves as a cantellated [[Tetrahedron]], as being a rectified [[Tetratetrahedron]].

{{Tetrahedron family}}

The cuboctahedron [[covering space|2-covers]] the [[tetrahemihexahedron]],&lt;ref name=&quot;richter&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Richter}}&lt;/ref&gt; which accordingly has the same [[abstract polytope|abstract]] [[vertex figure]] (2 triangles and two squares: 3.4.3.4) and half the vertices, edges, and faces. (The actual vertex figure of the THHH is 3.4.3/2.4, with the a/2 factor due to the cross.)

== Related polytopes ==

The cuboctahedron can be decomposed into a regular [[octahedron]] and eight irregular but equal octahedra in the shape of the convex hull of a cube with two opposite vertices removed. This decomposition of the cuboctahedron corresponds with the cell-first parallel projection of the [[24-cell]] into 3 dimensions. Under this projection, the cuboctahedron forms the projection envelope, which can be decomposed into 6 square faces, a regular octahedron, and 8 irregular octahedra. These elements correspond with the images of 6 of the octahedral cells in the 24-cell, the nearest and farthest cells from the 4D viewpoint, and the remaining 8 pairs of cells, respectively.

== Cultural occurrences ==
* In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode &quot;[[By Any Other Name]]&quot;, aliens seize the [[Starship Enterprise|Enterprise]] by transforming crew members into inanimate cuboctahedra.

* The &quot;Geo Twister&quot; fidget toy [http://www.trainerswarehouse.com/prodinfo.asp?number=FIGEO] is a flexible cuboctahedron.

{{Reg polyhedra db|Reg polyhedron stat table|C}}
In [[geometry]], a '''cube'''&lt;ref&gt;English ''cube'' from Old French &lt; Latin ''cubus'' &lt; Greek ''kubos'' meaning &quot;a cube, a die, vertebra&quot;. In turn from [[PIE]] ''*keu(b)-'', &quot;to bend, turn&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] solid object bounded by six [[square (geometry)|square]] faces, [[facet]]s or sides, with three meeting at each [[wikt:vertex|vertex]]. The cube can also be called a '''[[Regular polyhedron|regular]] [[hexahedron]]''' and is one of the five [[Platonic solid]]s. It is a special kind of square [[prism (geometry)|prism]], of rectangular [[parallelepiped]] and of [[trigonal trapezohedron]]. The cube is [[dual polyhedron|dual]] to the [[octahedron]]. It has cubical symmetry (also called [[octahedral symmetry]]). It is special by being a [[Cuboid]] and a [[Rhombohedron]].

For a cube centered at the origin, with edges parallel to the axes and with an edge length of 2, the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the vertices are
: (±1, ±1, ±1)
while the interior consists of all points (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with −1 &lt; ''x''&lt;sub&gt; ''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1.

As the volume of a cube is the third power of its sides ''a''×''a''×''a'', [[third power]]s are called ''[[cube (algebra)|cube]]s'', by analogy with [[square (algebra)|square]]s and second powers.

A cube has the largest volume among [[cuboid]]s (rectangular boxes) with a given [[surface area]]. Also, a cube has the largest volume among cuboids with the same total linear size(length+width+height).

==Uniform colorings and symmetry==
The cube has three uniform colorings, named by the colors of the square faces around each vertex: 111, 112, 123.

The cube has three classes of symmetry, which can be represented by [[vertex-transitive]] coloring the faces. The highest octahedral symmetry O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; has all the faces the same color. The [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions|dihedral symmetry]] D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt; comes from the cube being a prism, with all four sides being the same color. The lowest symmetry D&lt;sub&gt;2h&lt;/sub&gt; is also a prismatic symmetry, with sides alternating colors, so there are three colors, paired by opposite sides. Each symmetry form has a different [[Wythoff symbol]].

==Geometric relations==
[[Image:Stone Dice 17.JPG|right|thumb|150px|These familiar six-sided [[dice]] are cube-shaped.]]
A cube has 11 [[net (polyhedron)|net faces]] (see above for diagram) when unfolded into a plane.&lt;ref&gt;* {{mathworld | urlname = Cube | title = Cube}}&lt;/ref&gt; To colour the cube so that no two adjacent faces have the same colour, one would need at least 3 colours.

The cube is the cell of [[cubic honeycomb|the only regular tiling of Euclidean space]]. It is also unique among the Platonic solids in having faces with an even number of sides and, consequently, it is the only member of that group that is a [[zonohedron]] (every face has point symmetry).

The cube can be cut into 6 identical [[square pyramid]]s. If these square pyramids are then attached to the faces of a second cube, a [[rhombic dodecahedron]] is obtained (with pairs of coplanar triangles combined into rhombic faces.)

==Other dimensions==
The analogue of a cube in four-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] has a special name—a [[tesseract]] or (rarely) hypercube.

The analogue of the cube in ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space is called a hypercube or '''''n''-dimensional cube''' or simply '''''n''-cube'''. It is also called a ''measure polytope''.

There are analogues of the cube in lower dimensions too: a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in dimension 0, a [[segment (mathematics)|segment]] in one dimension and a square in two dimensions.

==Related polyhedra==
[[Image:Dual Cube-Octahedron.svg|thumb|200px|right|The dual of a [[cube]] is an [[octahedron]].]]
If the original cube has edge length 1, its [[dual polyhedron]] (an [[octahedron]]) has edge length &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The vertices of a cube can be grouped into two groups of four, each forming a regular [[tetrahedron]]; more generally this is referred to as a [[demicube]]. These two together form a regular [[polyhedral compound|compound]], the [[stella octangula]]. The intersection of the two forms a regular octahedron. The symmetries of a regular tetrahedron correspond to those of a cube which map each  tetrahedron to itself; the other symmetries of the cube map the two to each other.

One such regular tetrahedron has a volume of ⅓ of that of the cube. The remaining space consists of four equal irregular tetrahedra with a volume of 1/6 of that of the cube, each.

The [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] cube is the [[cuboctahedron]]. If smaller corners are cut off we get a polyhedron with 6 [[octagon]]al faces and 8 triangular ones. In particular we can get regular octagons ([[truncated cube]]). The [[rhombicuboctahedron]] is obtained by cutting off both corners and edges to the correct amount.

A cube can be inscribed in a [[dodecahedron]] so that each vertex of the cube is a vertex of the dodecahedron and each edge is a diagonal of one of the dodecahedron's faces; taking all such cubes gives rise to the regular compound of five cubes.

If two opposite corners of a cube are truncated at the depth of the 3 vertices directly connected to them, an irregular octahedron is obtained. Eight of these irregular octahedra can be attached to the triangular faces of a regular octahedron to obtain the cuboctahedron.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

All but the last of the figures shown have the same symmetries as the cube (see [[octahedral symmetry]]).

[[File:Hemicube2.PNG|thumb|The [[hemicube (geography)|hemicube]] is the 2-to-1 quotient of the cube.]]
The quotient of the cube by the [[Antipodal point|antipodal]] map yields a [[projective polyhedron]], the [[Hemicube (geometry)|hemicube]].

The cube is a special case in various classes of general polyhedra:
{| class=wikitable

|-
|Cuboid||No||Yes||Yes
|-
|Parallelepiped||No||Yes||No
|-
|[[quadrilateral]]ly faced hexahedron||No||No||No
|}

The cube is a part of a sequence of rhombic polyhedra and tilings with [n,3] [[Coxeter group]] symmetry. The cube can be seen as a rhombic hexahedron where the rhombi are squares.

==Combinatorial cubes==
A different kind of cube is the '''cube graph''', which is the graph of vertices and edges of the geometrical cube. It is a special case of the [[hypercube graph]].

An extension is the three dimensional ''k''-ary [[Hamming graph]], which for ''k'' = 2 is the cube graph.
Graphs of this sort occur in the theory of [[parallel computing|parallel processing]] in computers.

'''Commuter rail''', also called '''suburban rail''', is a [[passenger rail transport]] service between a city center, and outer suburbs and [[commuter town]]s or other locations that draw large numbers of [[commuting|commuters]]—people who travel on a daily basis. Trains operate following a schedule, at speeds varying from 50 to 200&amp;nbsp;km/h (30 to 125&amp;nbsp;mph). Distance charges or [[zone pricing]] may be used.

Non-English names include ''Treno suburbano'' in Italian, ''[[Cercanías]]'' in Spanish, ''Nahverkehrszug'' in German (and in some neighborhoods ''S-Bahn''s though these trains also often include city center metro-like sections), ''Train de banlieue'' in French, ''Příměstský vlak'' in Czech and [[Elektrichka]] in Russian. The development of commuter rail services has become popular today, with the increased public awareness of congestion, dependence on fossil fuels, and other [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]], as well as the rising costs of owning, operating and [[parking]] automobiles.

==Characteristics==
Most commuter trains are built to main line rail standards, differing from [[light rail]] or [[rapid transit]] systems by:
*being larger
*providing more seating and less standing room, for the longer distances involved
*having (in most cases) a lower frequency of service
*having scheduled services (i.e. trains run at specific times rather than at specific intervals)
*serving lower-density areas, typically by connecting [[suburb]]s to the city center
*sharing track or [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] with intercity or [[freight]] trains
*not fully grade separated (containing grade crossings with crossing gates)

===Train schedule===
Compared to [[rapid transit]], commuter rail has lower [[headway|frequency]], following a schedule rather than fixed intervals, and fewer stations spaced further apart. 
They serve lower density areas, and often share [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] with intercity or [[freight]] trains. Some services operate only during peak hours. 
Average speeds are high, often 50&amp;nbsp;km/h (30&amp;nbsp;mph) or higher.  
Some services include express services which skip some stations in order to run faster and separate riders from longer distance from short-distance ones.

The general range of commuter trains' distance varies between 15 and 200&amp;nbsp;km (10 and 125 miles).

===Track===
Their ability to coexist with freight or intercity services in the same [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] can drastically reduce system construction costs. However, frequently they are built with dedicated tracks within that right-of-way to prevent delays.

Most such trains run on the [[List of Rail Gauges|local standard gauge]] track. Some light rail systems may run on a narrower gauge. Examples of [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] systems are found in [[Japan]], [[Switzerland]], in the [[Brisbane]] ([[Citytrain]]) and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] ([[Transperth]]) systems in [[Australia]], and on the [[:it:Ferrovia Genova-Casella|Genoa-Casella line]] in [[Italy]].
Some countries, including [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Russia]], [[Brazil]] and [[Sri Lanka]], as well as [[Melbourne]] in [[Australia]], use [[broad gauge]].

===Distinction between other modes of rail===

'''Metro'''

Metro rail or [[rapid transit]] (or [[heavy rail system]]) usually covers a smaller area, has a higher train frequency and runs on separate tracks (underground or elevated), whereas commuter rail often shares tracks, technology and the legal framework with mainline railway. 

However, the classification as a metro or rapid rail can be difficult as both typically cover a metropolitan area, run on separate tracks in the centre, and often feature purpose-built rolling stock. The fact that the terminology is not standardised across countries (even across English-speaking countries) further complicates matters. The distinction is most easily made when there are two systems such as Paris' [[RER]] and [[Paris Métro|Métro]], London's [[London Overground|Overground]] and [[London Underground|Underground]], the [[S-Bahn]] and [[U-Bahn]] systems in Munich or Vienna, the [[East Japan Railway Company#Greater Tokyo Area|JR lines]] and the [[Tokyo Metro|Metro]] in [[Tokyo]].

'''[[Regional rail]]'''

Regional rail usually provides [[rail transport|rail services]] between towns and cities, rather than purely linking major population hubs in the way [[inter-city rail]] does. Regional rail operates outside major cities. Unlike Inter-city, it stops at most or all stations. It provides a service between smaller communities along the line, and also connections with long-distance services. Alternative names are &quot;local train&quot; or &quot;stopping train&quot;.
Examples include the former [[British Rail|BR]]'s [[Regional Railways]], France's [[Transport express régional|TER]] (''Transport express régional'') and Germany's [[DB Regio]] services.
Regional rail does not exist in this sense in the [[United States]], so the term &quot;regional rail&quot; has become synonymous with commuter rail.

'''[[Inter-city rail]]'''

In some European countries the distinction between commuter trains and long-distance/intercity trains is very hard to make, because of the relatively short distances involved. For example, so called &quot;[[Inter-city rail|intercity]]&quot; trains in [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] carry many commuters and their equipment, range and speeds are similar to those of commuter trains in some larger countries.

[[Elektrichka|Russian commuter trains]], on the other hand, frequently cover areas larger than Belgium itself, although these are still short distances by Russian standards. They have a different ticketing system from long-distance trains, and in major cities they often operate from a separate section of the train station.

'''[[High-speed rail]]'''

Sometimes high-speed rail can serve daily use of commuters. The Japanese [[Shinkansen]] high speed rail system is heavily used by commuters in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]]. They commute between 100 and 200&amp;nbsp;km by Shinkansen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} To meet the demand of commuters, [[Japan Railways Group|JR]] sells commuter discount passes and operates 16 car [[bilevel car|bilevel]] [[E4 Series Shinkansen]] at rush hour, providing a capacity of 1,600 seats. Several lines in China such as [[Guangzhou-Zhuhai Intercity Mass Rapid Transit]], the [[Beijing–Tianjin Intercity Railway]], and the [[Shanghai–Nanjing High-Speed Railway]], serve a similar role with many more under construction or planned.

==Train types==
Commuter trains are usually optimized for maximum passenger volume, in most cases without sacrificing too much comfort and [[luggage]] space, though they seldom have all the amenities of long-distance trains. Cars may be single- or [[bilevel car|double-level]], and aim to provide seating for all. Compared to intercity trains, they have less space, fewer amenities and limited baggage areas.

===Multiple unit type===
Commuter rail trains are usually composed of [[multiple unit]]s, which are self-propelled, bidirectional, articulated passenger rail cars with driving motors on each (or every other) [[bogie]]. Depending on local circumstances and tradition they may be powered either by [[diesel engines]] located below the passenger compartment ([[diesel multiple unit]]s) or by electricity picked up from [[third rail]]s or [[overhead lines]] ([[electric multiple unit]]s). Multiple units are almost invariably equipped with control cabs at both ends, which is why such units are so frequently used to provide commuter services, due to the associated short turn-around time.

===Locomotive hauled services===
Locomotive hauled services are used in some countries or locations. This is often a case of [[Business operations|asset sweating]], by using a single large combined fleet for intercity and regional services. Loco hauled services are usually run in [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] formation, that is, the train can run with the locomotive at the &quot;front&quot; or &quot;rear&quot; of the train (pushing or pulling). Trains are often equipped with a control cab at the other end of the train from the locomotive, allowing the train operator to operate the train from either end. The motive power for locomotive-hauled commuter trains may be either electric or [[Diesel-electric transmission|Diesel-electric]], although some countries, such as Germany and some of the former Soviet-bloc countries, also use diesel-hydraulic locomotives.

=== Seat plans ===
In the U.S. and some other countries, a three-and-two seat plan is used. However, few people sit in the middle seat on these trains because they feel crowded and uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/31/nyregion/31seat.html?pagewanted=1]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said one industrial designer for one of [[Transportation in New York City|New York City's]] commuter railroads, [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro-North]], told people: &quot;I designed the aisle seat with a half-back and no upholstery, so it will be very uncomfortable to sit there. They'll move in and take the center seat!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/06/opinion/l06train.html]&lt;/ref&gt; (This seating design can also be found on older [[New Jersey Transit]] and [[Long Island Rail Road]] rolling stock.)

In Japan, longitudinal (sideways window-lining) seat is widely used in commuter rail to increase capacity in rush hours. Carriages are not organized to increase [[seating capacity]] even in the case of commuting longer than 50&amp;nbsp;km and commuters in [[Greater Tokyo Area]] have to stand in the train for more than an hour.

==Commuter rail in the world==
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}

===Africa===

Currently there are not many examples of commuter rail in Africa. [[Metrorail (South Africa)|Metrorail]] operates in the major cities of [[South Africa]], and there are some commuter rail services in [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]].

===Asia===
[[File:JRE-E231-500-for-JRyamanote-line.jpg|thumb|[[Yamanote Line]] which is representative of the Japanese commuter rail.]]
In [[Japan]], commuter rail systems have extensive network and frequent service, and are heavily used. It is notable that many of them are run by [[Private railway]] companies.

In [[India]], commuter rail systems are present in major cities. [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]], the oldest suburban rail system in Asia, ‎carries more than 6.9 million commuters on a daily basis which constitutes more than half of the total daily passenger capacity of the Indian Railways itself. [[Kolkata Suburban Railway]] is huge and extensive and covers large areas in Kolkata's hinterland. The [[Chennai Suburban Railway]] is another railway of comparison. In [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], the [[MMTS]] mainly transports people from the city centre to [[HI-TEC city]], the city's [[Information Technology]] hub. Other commuter rails in India include Delhi Suburban Railway, Pune Suburban Railway and Lucknow-Kanpur Suburban Railway.

Commuter trains are currently uncommon in [[China]], although a [[Beijing Suburban Railway|small system]] has been inaugurated in [[Beijing]] in 2008.
Commuter rail systems are also planned for [[Shanghai]], [[Nanjing]],[[Tianjin]] and around the [[Pearl River Delta]] region.

In [[Iran]], SYSTRA has done a &quot;Tehran long term urban rail study&quot;. SYSTRA proposed 4 express lines which are similar to [[RER]] lines in [[Paris]].
[[Tehran Metro]] is going to construct express lines. For instance, the Rahyab Behineh, a consultant for Tehran Metro, is studying Tehran Express Line 2. Tehran Metro currently has a commuter line between [[Tehran]] and [[Karaj]].

Other examples in Asia include [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]] which has suburban lines operated by [[Korail]] in [[South Korea]], [[KTM Komuter]] in [[Malaysia]], The [[Philippine National Railways]] orange line in [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]] and, [[KRL Jabotabek]] in [[Jakarta]] Metropolitan area, [[Indonesia]].

===Europe===
{{Main|S-Bahn|RER|Commuter rail in the United Kingdom}}
[[Image:Ny pendeltag stockholm.jpg|thumb|Type [[SL X60|X60]] at Stockholm Central in Sweden]]
[[File:Z20500lm.jpg|thumb|A [[Z 20500]] train from [[Paris]]'s [[RER]] [[RER D|line D]] running an old &quot;ZYCK&quot; (now renamed &quot;ZUCO&quot;) route towards [[Melun]]]]
Major metropolitan areas in most European countries are usually served by extensive commuter rail systems. Well-known examples include [[Beovoz]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] , [[S-Bahn]] in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]], [[RER]] in [[France]], [[Milan_Transportation_System#Suburban Railway Service (S Lines)|Linee S]] in [[Italy]], [[Cercanías]] in [[Spain]] and [[HÉV]] in [[Budapest, Hungary]]. 

In [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and some other countries of the former [[Soviet Union]], electrical multiple unit passenger suburban train called [[Elektrichka]] is widespread.

===North America===
{{Main|Commuter rail in North America}}
In the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]] regional passenger rail service is provided by governmental or quasi-governmental agencies, with a limited number of metropolitan areas served.

===South America===
[[File:Toshiba Electrico Ferrocarril Sarmiento Haedo.JPG|thumb|The [[Ferrocarril Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Sarmiento Line]] is part of the extensive [[Rail transport in Argentina#Commuter network|Buenos Aires metropolitan rail system]].]]
Examples include an {{convert|899|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} commuter system in the [[Rail transport in Argentina#Commuter network|Buenos Aires metropolitan area]], the {{convert|225|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} long [[Supervia]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], and the [[Metrotrén]] in [[Santiago, Chile]]. Another example is [[Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos]] (CPTM) in [[Greater São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. CPTM has 93 stations with six lines, numbered starting on 7 (the lines 1 to 6 belong to the [[São Paulo Metro]]), with a total length of {{convert|260.8|km}}.

===Oceania===
Major cities in Australia have suburban railway systems in their metropolitan areas. As with Japanese suburban railways or Germany's S-Bahns, these have far more frequent service and far higher ridership per capita than 'commuter rail' in the usual sense of the term. These networks operate as commuter/metro hybrids. This is particularly so in Sydney and Melbourne, where headways on many lines reach 5–10 minutes in peak and 10–20 minutes off peak (about 18 hours a day) and enter an underground loop in the city centre; and where ridership per capita exceeds the sum of metro and commuter rail in comparable urban areas such as Toronto, Boston or the San Francisco Bay Area. All systems, however, are based on established commuter rail systems, and track sharing/crossing on parts of the network inhibit higher frequencies. The main systems include:
*[[CityRail]] in [[Sydney]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Wollongong]]. (largest metropolitan network in Australia)
*[[Metro Trains Melbourne]] in [[Melbourne]].
*[[Queensland Rail]] in [[Brisbane]].
*[[Transperth Trains]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].
*[[TransAdelaide]] in [[Adelaide]].

[[New Zealand]] has two commuter rail systems: [[Public transport in Auckland|in Auckland]] and in Wellington ([[Tranz Metro]]).

'''Cambridgeshire''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|eɪ|m|b|r|ɪ|dʒ|ʃ|ər}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|m|b|r|ɪ|dʒ|ʃ|ɪər}}; also known, archaically, as the '''County of Cambridge'''; abbreviated '''Cambs.''') is a [[Counties of the United Kingdom#England|county]] in [[England]], bordering [[Lincolnshire]] to the north, [[Norfolk]] to the northeast, [[Suffolk]] to the east, [[Essex]] and [[Hertfordshire]] to the south, and [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Northamptonshire]] to the west. Modern Cambridgeshire was formed from the historic counties of Cambridgeshire and [[Huntingdonshire]], together with the [[Isle of Ely]] and the [[Soke of Peterborough]]; it contains most of the region known as [[Silicon Fen]]. The [[county town]] is [[Cambridge]].

Cambridgeshire is [[Twin towns|twinned]] with [[Viersen (district)|Kreis Viersen]] in [[Germany]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Cambridgeshire}}
Cambridgeshire is noted as the site of some of the earliest known [[Neolithic]] permanent settlements in the [[United Kingdom]], along with sites at [[Fengate]] and [[Balbridie]].

Cambridgeshire was recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] as &quot;Grantbridgeshire&quot; (or rather ''Grentebrigescire'') (cf the river Granta).
Covering a large part of [[East Anglia]], Cambridgeshire today is the result of several local government unifications. In 1888 when [[county council]]s were introduced, separate councils were set up, following the traditional division of Cambridgeshire, for
*the area in the south around Cambridge, and
*the liberty of the [[Isle of Ely]].
In 1965, these two administrative counties were merged to form [[Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely]].&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely Order 1964 (SI 1964/366), see [[Local Government Commission for England (1958 - 1967)]], ''Report and Proposals for the East Midlands General Review Area'' (Report No.3), 31 July 1961 and ''Report and Proposals for the Lincolnshire and East Anglia General Review Area'' (Report No.9), 7 May 1965&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] this merged with the county to the west, [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]] (which had itself been created in 1965 by the merger of [[Huntingdonshire]] with the [[Soke of Peterborough]] – previously a part of [[Northamptonshire]] which had its own county council). The resulting county was called simply Cambridgeshire.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972|The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972]] (SI 1972/2039) Part 5: County of Cambridgeshire&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998 the [[City of Peterborough]] has been a separately administered area, as a [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]], but is associated with Cambridgeshire for ceremonial purposes such as [[Lord-Lieutenant|Lieutenancy]], and functions such as policing and the fire service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legialtion.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1878 The Cambridgeshire (City of Peterborough) (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996] (SI 1996/1878), see [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)]], ''Final Recommendations for the Future Local Government of Cambridgeshire'', October 1994 and ''Final Recommendations on the Future Local Government of Basildon &amp; Thurrock, Blackburn &amp; Blackpool, Broxtowe, Gedling &amp; Rushcliffe, Dartford &amp; Gravesham, Gillingham &amp; Rochester upon Medway, Exeter, Gloucester, Halton &amp; Warrington, Huntingdonshire &amp; Peterborough, Northampton, Norwich, Spelthorne and the Wrekin'', December 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the conservation charity [[Plantlife]] unofficially designated Cambridgeshire's [[county flower]] as the [[Pulsatilla vulgaris|Pasqueflower]].

A great quantity of [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds from the [[Stone Age]], the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]] were made in [[East Cambridgeshire]]. Most items were found in [[Isleham]].

The [[Cambridgeshire Regiment]] (or [[Fen Tigers]]) county based army unit fought in South Africa, WWI and WWII.

Due to its flat terrain and proximity to the continent, many bases were built for [[RAF Bomber Command]], [[RAF Fighter Command]], and the [[USAAF]] in WW2. In recognition of this, the only American WW2 burial ground in England is located in Madingley [[Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial]].

Most English counties have nicknames for their people, such as a [[Tyke]] from [[Yorkshire]] and a [[Yellowbelly]] from [[Lincolnshire]]; the traditional [[nickname]]s for people from Cambridgeshire are 'Cambridgeshire Camel' or 'Cambridgeshire Crane', referring to the wildfowl which were once abundant in the fens. The term 'Fenners' has been applied to those who come from the flat country to the north of Cambridge; however in recent times this term is considered to be abusive and its use is now less widespread.

Original historical documents relating to Cambridgeshire are held by [[Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies]].

==Geography==
Large areas of the county are extremely low-lying and [[Holme Fen]] is notable for being the UK's lowest physical point at 2.75&amp;nbsp;m (9&amp;nbsp;ft) below sea level. The highest point is in the village of [[Great Chishill]] at 146&amp;nbsp;m (480&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level. Other [[topographic prominence|prominent]] hills are [[Little Trees Hill]] and [[Wandlebury Hill]] in the [[Gog Magog Downs]], [[Rivey Hill]] above [[Linton, Cambridgeshire|Linton]], [[Rowley's Hill]] and the [[Madingley Hills]].

==Politics==
Cambridgeshire contains seven [[UK Parliamentary Constituency|Parliamentary constituencies]]: [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]], [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]], [[North East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Cambridgeshire]], [[North West Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Cambridgeshire]], [[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough]], [[South Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cambridgeshire]], and [[South East Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South East Cambridgeshire]].

==Economy==
This is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of Cambridgeshire at current basic prices [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/RegionalGVA.pdf published] (pp.&amp;nbsp;240–253) by ''Office for National Statistics'' with figures in millions of English Pounds Sterling.

[[AWG plc]] is based in Huntingdon. The [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] has several bases in the Huntingdon and [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]] area. [[Waterbeach]], 6 miles north of Cambridge, is a former RAF base, now used as an army barracks. RAF [[Alconbury]], 3 miles north of Huntingdon, is being reorganized after a period of obsolescence following the departure of the USAF, to be the focus of RAF/USAFE intelligence operations, with activities at [[Upwood]] and [[Molesworth]] being transferred there. Most of Cambridgeshire is agricultural. Close to Cambridge is the so-called [[Silicon Fen]] area of high-technology (electronics, computing and biotechnology) companies. [[ARM Limited]] is based in [[Cherry Hinton]].

==Education==
===Primary and secondary===
Cambridgeshire has a completely comprehensive education system with 12 independent schools and over 240 state schools, not including [[sixth form college]]s.

Some of the secondary schools act as [[Village College]]s, institutions unique to Cambridgeshire. For example [[Bottisham Village College]].

===Tertiary===
Cambridgeshire is home to a number of institutes of [[higher education]]:

* The [[University of Cambridge]] - [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|second-oldest]] university in the English-speaking world, and regarded as one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the world
* [[Anglia Ruskin University]] - has a [[campus]] located in Cambridge and a base at [[Fulbourn]]
* The [[Open University]] - has a regional centre located in Cambridge
* The [[University Centre Peterborough]] - operated by Anglia Ruskin University and [[Peterborough Regional College]], located in Peterborough
* The [[College of West Anglia]] has a campus at Milton, on the northern outskirts of Cambridge

In addition, [[Cambridge Regional College]] and [[Huntingdonshire Regional College]] both offer a limited range of higher education courses in conjunction with partner universities.

==Settlements==
These are the settlements in Cambridgeshire with a town charter, city status or a population over 5,000; for a complete list of settlements see [[list of places in Cambridgeshire]].

* [[Whittlesey]]
* [[Yaxley, Cambridgeshire|Yaxley]]

The town of [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] is surrounded on three sides by Cambridgeshire, being connected by a narrow strip of land to the rest of [[Suffolk]].

==Climate==
Cambridgeshire has a Maritime Temperate climate, similar to the rest of the United Kingdom. It has substantially less rainfall than the average as it is often sheltered by the core of Westerly and South Westerly winds. Temperatures are often cooler than the English average in winter, due to its position in the East of England and its sheltered area from the prevailing winds. Snowfall is slightly less rare than in Western areas, due to Easterly winds bringing occasional snow from the North Sea. In Summer, temperatures are average or slightly above, due to its dryness. It reaches 25C on around 10 days each year, and is comparable to parts of Kent and East Anglia.

==Sports==
Cambridgeshire is the birthplace of [[bandy]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} now an IOC accepted sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalbandy.com/viewNavMenu.do?menuID=4 |title=Federation of International Bandy-Olympic |publisher=Internationalbandy.com |date=2004-08-12 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to documents from 1813 [[Bury Fen Bandy Club]] was undefeated for 100 years.

'''Christian Goldbach''' (March 18, 1690 &amp;ndash; November 20, 1764) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] who also studied [[law]]. He is remembered today for [[Goldbach's conjecture]].

==Biography==
Born in the [[Duchy of Prussia]]'s capital [[Königsberg]], part of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], Goldbach was the son of a pastor. He studied at the [[University of Königsberg|Royal Albertus University]].
After finishing his studies he went on long educational voyages from 1710 to 1724 through Europe, visiting other German states, England, Holland, Italy, and France, meeting with many famous mathematicians, such as [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Leonhard Euler]], and [[Nicholas I Bernoulli]]. Back in Königsberg he got acquainted with [[Georg Bernhard Bilfinger]] and [[Jakob Hermann]]. 

He went on to work at the newly opened [[St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] in 1725. Later on, he was a tutor to the later Tsar [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]] in 1728.  In 1742 he entered the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;element&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosen|first=Kenneth H.|title=Elementary Number Theory, Fifth Edition|year=2004|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0321237072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
Goldbach is most noted for his correspondence with Leibniz, Euler, and Bernoulli, especially in his 1742 letter to Euler stating his [[Goldbach's Conjecture]]. He also studied and proved some theorems on [[perfect power]]s, such as the [[Goldbach-Euler theorem]], and made several notable contributions to analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;element&quot;/&gt;

{{Politics of Ancient Rome}}

The censor was an officer in ancient Rome who was responsible for maintaining the [[census]], supervising [[public morality]], and overseeing certain aspects of the government's finances.

The censors' regulation of public morality is the origin of the modern meaning of the words &quot;censor&quot; and &quot;censorship.&quot;

==Creation of the rank==
The ''census'' was first instituted by [[Servius Tullius]], sixth [[king of Rome]]. After the abolition of the monarchy and the founding of the  [[Republic]], the [[consul]]s had responsibility for the census until 443 BC.  In 442 BC, no consuls were elected, but [[military tribune]]s with consular power were appointed instead; this was a move by the [[plebeians]] to try to attain higher magistracies: only [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] could be elected consuls, while some military tribunes were plebeians.  To avoid the possibility of plebeians obtaining control of the census, the patricians removed the right to take the census from the consuls and tribunes, and appointed for this duty two magistrates, called ''censores'' (censors), elected exclusively from the patricians in Rome. &lt;!-- Why was taking the census so valuable? --&gt;

The magistracy continued to be controlled by patricians until 351 BC, when [[Gaius Marcius Rutilus]] was appointed the first plebeian censor.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Livy]]'' vii.22.&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve years afterwards in [[339 BC]], one of the [[Publilian laws]] required that one censor had to be a plebeian.&lt;ref&gt;Livy viii.12.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, no plebeian censor performed the solemn purification of the people (the &quot;''[[#Lustrum|lustrum]]''&quot;; ''Livy'' [[Periochae]] 13) until 280 BC. In 131 BC, for the first time, both censors were plebeians.

There were two censors, because the two consuls had previously taken the census together. If one of the censors died during his term of office, another was chosen to replace him, just as with consuls. This happened only once, in 393 BC. However the [[Gaul]]s captured Rome in that ''[[lustrum]]'' (five-year period), and the Romans thereafter regarded such replacement as &quot;an offense against religion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Livy v.31.&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, if one of the censors died, his colleague resigned, and two new censors were chosen to replace them.&lt;ref&gt;Livy vi.27, ix.34, xxiv.43, xxvii.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election==
The censors were elected in the [[Centuriate Assembly]], which met under the presidency of a consul.&lt;ref&gt;[[Auli Gellii]] xiii.15; ''Livy'' xl.45.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Barthold Niebuhr]] suggests that the censors were at first elected by the [[Curiate Assembly]], and that the Assembly's selections were confirmed by the Centuriate; but [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] believes that &quot;there is no authority for this supposition, and the truth of it depends entirely upon the correctness of &lt;nowiki&gt;[Niebuhr's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; views respecting the election of the consuls&quot;. Both censors had to be elected on the same day, and accordingly if the voting for the second was not finished in the same day, the election of the first was invalidated, and a new assembly had to be held.&lt;ref&gt;Livy ix.34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The assembly for the election of the censors was held under different [[auspice]]s from those at the election of the consuls and [[praetor]]s, so the censors were not regarded as their colleagues, although they likewise possessed the ''[[maxima auspicia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Gellii'' xiii.15.&lt;/ref&gt; The assembly was held by the new consuls shortly after they began their term of office;&lt;ref&gt;Livy xxiv.10, xxxix.41.&lt;/ref&gt; and the censors, as soon as they were elected and the censorial power had been granted to them by a decree of the Centuriate Assembly (''lex centuriata''), were fully installed in their office.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[de Lege Agraria]]'' ii.11; ''Livy'' xl.45.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general principle, the only ones eligible for the office of censor were those who had previously been consuls, but there were a few exceptions. At first, there was no law to prevent a person being censor twice, but the only person who was elected to the office twice was [[Gaius Marcius Rutilus]] in [[265 BC]].  In that year, he originated a law stating that no one could be elected censor twice.  In consequence of this, he received the [[cognomen]] of ''[[Marcius Censorinus|Censorinus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Life of Coriolanus]]'' 1; [[Valerius Maximus]] iv.1 §3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes==
The censorship differed from all other Roman magistracies in the length of office. The censors were originally chosen for a whole ''lustrum'' (the period of five years), but as early as ten years after its institution ([[433 BC]]) their office was limited to eighteen months by a law of the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy iv.24, ix.33.&lt;/ref&gt; The censors were also unique with respect to rank and dignity. They had no ''[[imperium]]'', and accordingly no [[lictor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Zonar''. vii.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Their rank was granted to them by the Centuriate Assembly, and not by the ''[[curia]]e'', and in that respect they were inferior in power to the consuls and praetors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''de Lege Agraria'' ii.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding this, the censorship was regarded as the highest dignity in the state, with the exception of the dictatorship; it was a &quot;sacred magistracy&quot; (''sanctus magistratus''), to which the deepest reverence was due.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''[[Life of Cato the Elder]]'' 16, ''[[Life of Flaminius]]'' 18, ''[[Life of Camillus]]'' 2, 14, ''[[Life of Aemilius]]'' 38; Cicero ''[[ad Familiares]]'' iii.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The high rank and dignity which the censorship obtained was due to the various important duties gradually entrusted to it, and especially to its possessing the ''regimen morum'', or general control over the conduct and the morals of the citizens.  In the exercise of this power, they were regulated solely by their own views of duty, and were not responsible to any other power in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Dionys. in ''Mai, Nova Coll.'' vol. ii p516; Livy iv.24, xxix.37; Valerius Maximus vii.2 §6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The censors possessed of course the &quot;[[curule chair]]&quot; (''sella curulis''),&lt;ref&gt;Livy xl.45.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is some doubt with respect to their official dress. A well-known passage of Polybius&lt;ref&gt;vi.53.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the use of the ''imagines'' at funerals; we may conclude that a consul or praetor wore the purple-bordered ''[[toga praetexta]]'', one who triumphed the embroidered ''[[toga picta]]'', and the censor a purple toga peculiar to him; but other writers speak of their official dress as being the same as that of the other higher magistrates.&lt;ref&gt;Zonar. vii.19; Athen. xiv. p660c.&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral of a censor was always conducted with great pomp and splendour, and hence a &quot;censorial funeral&quot; (''funus censorium'') was voted even to the emperors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]] ''[[Annales]]'' iv.15, xiii.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition==
The censorship continued in existence for 421 years, from [[443 BC]] to [[22 BC]]; but during this period many ''lustra'' passed by without any censor being chosen at all. According to one statement, the office was abolished by [[Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla]].&lt;ref&gt;Schol. Gronov. ''ad Cic. Div. in Caecil.'' 3, p384, ed. [[Johann Caspar Orelli]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the authority on which this statement rests is not of much weight, the fact itself is probable, since there was no census during the two ''lustra'' which elapsed from Sulla's dictatorship to [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey)]]'s first consulship ([[82 BC|82]]&amp;ndash;[[70 BC]]), and any strict &quot;imposition of morals&quot; would have been found inconvenient to the aristocracy that supported Sulla.

If the censorship was done away with by Sulla, it was at any rate restored in the consulship of Pompey and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]. Its power was limited by one of the laws of the tribune [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] ([[58 BC]]), which prescribed certain regular forms of proceeding before the censors in expelling a person from the [[Roman Senate]], and required that the censors be in agreement to exact this punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]] xxxviii.13; Cicero ''[[pro Sestio]]'' 25, ''de Prov. Cons.'' 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This law, however, was repealed in the third consulship of Pompey in [[52 BC]], on the urging of his colleague [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica|Caecilius Metellus Scipio]],&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio xl.57.&lt;/ref&gt; but the office of the censorship never recovered its former power and influence.

During the [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]] which followed soon afterwards, no censors were elected; it was only after a long interval that they were again appointed, namely in [[22 BC]], when [[Augustus]] caused [[Lucius Munatius Plancus]] and [[Aemilius Lepidus Paullus]] to fill the office.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] ''[[Life of Augustus]]'' 37, ''[[Life of Claudius]]'' 16; Cassius Dio liv.2.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last time that such magistrates were appointed; the emperors in future discharged the duties of their office under the name of [[Praefectura Morum]] (&quot;prefect of the morals&quot;).

Some of the emperors sometimes took the name of censor when they held a census of the Roman people; this was the case with [[Claudius]], who appointed the elder [[Vitellius]] as his colleague,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius ''[[Life of Claudius]]'' 16; Tacitus Annales xii.4, [[Histories (Tacitus)|Historia]] i.9.&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Vespasian]], who likewise had a colleague in his son [[Titus]].&lt;ref&gt;Suet. Vesp. 8, Tit. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domitian]] assumed the title of &quot;perpetual censor&quot; (''censor perpetuus''),&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio liii.18.&lt;/ref&gt; but this example was not imitated by succeeding emperors. In the reign of [[Decius]] we find the elder [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] nominated to the censorship,&lt;ref&gt;Symmach. ''Ep.'' iv.29, v.9)&lt;/ref&gt; but Valerian was never actually elected censor.

==Duties==
The duties of the censors may be divided into three classes, all of which were closely connected with one another: 

#The ''[[Roman census|Census]]'', or register of the citizens and of their property, in which were included the reading of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]'s lists (''lectio senatus'') and the recognition of who qualified for [[Equites|equestrian]] rank (''recognitio equitum'');
#The ''Regimen Morum'', or keeping of the public morals; and
#The administration of the finances of the state, under which were classed the superintendence of the public buildings and the erection of all new public works.

The original business of the censorship was at first of a much more limited kind, and was restricted almost entirely to taking the census,&lt;ref&gt;Livy iv.8.&lt;/ref&gt; but the possession of this power gradually brought with it fresh power and new duties, as is shown below. A general view of these duties is briefly expressed in the following passage of Cicero&lt;ref&gt;''[[De legibus]]'' iii.3.&lt;/ref&gt;: &quot;Censores populi aevitates, soboles, familias pecuniasque censento: urbis templa, vias, aquas, aerarium, vectigalia tuento: populique partes in tribus distribunto: exin pecunias, aevitates, ordines patiunto: equitum, peditumque prolem describunto: caelibes esse prohibento: mores populi regunto: probrum in senatu ne relinquunto.&quot; &lt;!-- Needs translation! --&gt; This can be translated roughly as: &quot;The Censors are to determine the generations, origins, families, and properties of the people; they are to (watch over/protect) the city's temples, roads, waters, treasury, and taxes; they are to divide the people into three parts; next, they are to (allow/approve) the properties, generations, and ranks [of the people]; they are to describe the offspring of knights and footsoldiers; they are to forbid being unmarried; they are to guide the behavior of the people; they are not to overlook abuse in the Senate.&quot; &lt;!-- This translation is imperfect, if anyone can do it better please do --&gt;


===Census===
The Census, the first and principal duty of the censors, was always held in the [[Campus Martius]], and from the year [[435 BC]] onwards, in a special building called [[Villa Publica]], which was erected for that purpose by the second pair of censors, [[Gaius Furius Pacilus]] and [[Marcus Geganius Macerinus]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy iv.22; [[Varro]] ''[[de Re Rustica]]'' iii.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

An account of the formalities with which the census was opened is given in a fragment of the ''[[Tabulae Censoriae]]'', preserved by Varro.&lt;ref&gt;''De lingua Latina'' vi.86, 87, ed. Müller.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[auspices]] had been taken, the citizens were summoned by a public crier to appear before the censors. Each tribe was called up separately,&lt;ref&gt;Dionys. v.75.&lt;/ref&gt; and the names in each tribe were probably taken according to the lists previously made out by the tribunes of the tribes. Every [[paterfamilias]] had to appear in person before the censors, who were seated in their [[curule chair]]s, and those names were taken first which were considered to be of good omen, such as [[Valerius]], [[Salvius]], [[Statorius]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Festus, ''s.v. Lacus Lucrinus''; Schol. Bob. ''ad Cic. pro Scaur.'' p374, ed. Orelli.&lt;/ref&gt;

The census was conducted according to the judgment of the censor (''ad arbitrium censoris''), but the censors laid down certain rules,&lt;ref&gt;Livy iv.8, xxix.15.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called ''leges censui censendo'',&lt;ref&gt;Liv. xliii.14.&lt;/ref&gt; in which mention was made of the different kinds of property subject to the census, and in what way their value was to be estimated. According to these laws, each citizen had to give an account of himself, of his family, and of his property upon oath, &quot;declared from the heart&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] iv.15; Livy xliii.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

First he had to give his full name ([[praenomen]], [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]], and [[cognomen]]) and that of his father, or if he were a ''[[Libertus]]'' (&quot;freedman&quot;) that of his [[Patronus|patron]], and he was likewise obliged to state his age. He was then asked, &quot;You, declaring from your heart, do you have a wife?&quot; and if married he had to give the name of his wife, and likewise the number, names, and ages of his children, if any.&lt;ref&gt;Gell. iv.20; Cicero ''[[de Oratore]]'' ii.64; Tab. Heracl. 142 (68); ''[[Digesta Iustiniani]]'' 50 tit.15 s3.&lt;/ref&gt; Single women and orphans were represented by their guardians; their names were entered in separate lists, and they were not included in the sum total of heads.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Livy iii.3, ''[[Periochae]]'' 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a citizen had stated his name, age, family, etc., he then had to give an account of all his property, so far as it was subject to the census. Only such things were liable to the census (''censui censendo'') as were property according to the [[Quiritarian]] law. At first, each citizen appears to have merely given the value of his whole property in general without entering into details;&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius iv.15; Cicero ''[[de Legibus]]'' iii.3; Festus, s.v. ''Censores''.&lt;/ref&gt; but it soon became the practice to give a minute specification of each article, as well as the general value of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Cicero ''pro Flacc.'' 32; Gell. vii.11; Plutarch ''[[Life of Cato the Elder]]'' 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Land formed the most important article of the census, but public land, the possession of which only belonged to a citizen&lt;!-- ??? --&gt;, was excluded as not being [[Quiritarian]] property. If we may judge from the practice of the imperial period, it was the custom to give a most minute specification of all such land as a citizen held according to the Quiritarian law. He had to state the name and location of the land, and to specify what portion of it was arable, what meadow, what vineyard, and what olive-ground: and of the land thus described, he had to give his assessment of its value.&lt;ref&gt;''Digesta Iustiniani'' 50 tit.15 s4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavery|Slave]]s and cattle formed the next most important item. The censors also possessed the right of calling for a return of such objects as had not usually been given in, such as clothing, jewels, and carriages.&lt;ref&gt;Livy xxxix.44; Plutarch ''Life of Cato the Elder'' 18.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been doubted by some modern writers whether the censors possessed the power of setting a higher valuation on the property than the citizens themselves gave, but when we recollect the discretionary nature of the censors' powers, and the necessity almost that existed, in order to prevent fraud, that the right of making a surcharge should be vested in somebody's hands, we can hardly doubt that the censors had this power. It is moreover expressly stated that on one occasion they made an extravagant surcharge on articles of luxury;&lt;ref&gt;Livy xxxix.44; Plutarch ''Life of Cato the Elder'' 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and even if they did not enter in their books the property of a person at a higher value than he returned it, they accomplished the same end by compelling him to pay a tax upon the property at a higher rate than others. The tax was usually one per thousand upon the property entered in the books of the censors, but on one occasion the censors compelled a person to pay eight per thousand as a punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Livy iv.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who voluntarily absented himself from the census was considered ''incensus'' and subject to the severest punishment. [[Servius Tullius]] is said to have threatened such individuals with imprisonment and death,&lt;ref&gt;Livy i.44.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] period he might be sold by the state as a slave&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''[[pro Caecina Oratio]]'' 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In the later times of the republic, a person who was absent from the census might be represented by another, and be thus registered by the censors.&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''De lingua Latina'' vi.86.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the soldiers who were absent on service had to appoint a representative is uncertain. In ancient times, the sudden outbreaks of war prevented the census from being taken,&lt;ref&gt;Livy vi.31.&lt;/ref&gt; because a large number of the citizens would necessarily be absent. It is supposed from a passage in Livy&lt;ref&gt;xxix.37.&lt;/ref&gt; that in later times the censors sent commissioners into the provinces with full powers to take the census of the Roman soldiers there, but this seems to have been a special case. It is, on the contrary, probable from the way in which Cicero pleads the absence of Archias from [[Rome]] with the army under [[Lucullus]], as a sufficient reason for his not having been enrolled in the census,&lt;ref&gt;''[[pro Licinio Archia]]'' 5.&lt;/ref&gt; that service in the army was a valid excuse for absence.

After the censors had received the names of all the citizens with the amount of their property, they then had to make out the lists of the tribes, and also of the classes and centuries; for by the legislation of Servius Tullius the position of each citizen in the state was determined by the amount of his property (Comitia Centuriata). These lists formed a most important part of the Tabulae Censoriae, under which name were included all the documents connected in any way with the discharge of the censors' duties.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero de Legibus iii.3; Liv. xxiv.18; Plut. Cat. Maj. 16; Cic. de Leg. Agr. i.2.&lt;/ref&gt; These lists, insofar as they were connected with the finances of the state, were deposited in the aerarium, which was the temple of Saturn;&lt;ref&gt;Liv. xxix.37.&lt;/ref&gt; but the regular depositary for all the archives of the censors was in earlier times the Atrium Libertatis, near the Villa publica,&lt;ref&gt;Liv. xliii.16, xlv.15.&lt;/ref&gt; and in later times the temple of the Nymphs.&lt;ref&gt;Cic. pro Mil. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the division of the citizens into tribes, centuries, and classes, the censors had also to make out the lists of the [[Roman Senate|senators]] for the ensuing five years, or till new censors were appointed; striking out the names of such as they considered unworthy, and making additions to the body from those who were qualified. In the same manner they held a review of the [[Equites|Equestrian]]s who received a horse from public funds (''equites equo publico''), and added and removed names as they judged proper. They also confirmed the [[princeps senatus]], or appointed a new one. The princeps himself had to be a former censor.

After the lists had been completed, the number of citizens was counted up, and the sum total announced.  Accordingly, we find that in the account of a census, the number of citizens is likewise usually given. They are in such cases spoken of as ''capita'' (&quot;heads&quot;), sometimes with the addition of the word ''civium'' (&quot;of the citizens&quot;), and sometimes not.  Hence, to be registered in the census was the same thing as &quot;having a head&quot; (''caput habere'').

====Census beyond Rome====
A census was sometimes taken in the provinces, even under the republic.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''[[In Verrem]]'' ii.53, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor sent into the provinces special officers called Censitores to take the census;&lt;ref&gt;Dig. 50 tit.15 s4 § 1; Cassiod. Var. ix.11; Orelli, Inscr. No. 3652.&lt;/ref&gt; but the duty was sometimes discharged by the Imperial legati.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]] Ann. i.31, ii.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Censitores were assisted by subordinate officers, called Censuales, who made out the lists, &amp;c.&lt;ref&gt;Capitol. Gordian. 12; Symmach. Ep. x.43; Cod. Theod. 8 tit.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, the census was still taken under the empire, but the old ceremonies connected with it were no longer performed, and the ceremony of the lustration was not performed after the time of Vespasian. The jurists Paulus and [[Ulpian]] each wrote works on the census in the imperial period; and several extracts from these works are given in a chapter in the ''Digest'' (50 15). &lt;!-- Could we link this digest? --&gt;

====Other uses of census====
The word ''census'', besides the conventional meaning of &quot;valuation&quot; of a person's estate, has other meaning in Rome; it could refer to: 
*the amount of a person's property (hence we read of ''census senatorius'', the estate of a senator; ''census equestris'', the estate of an [[eques]]).
*the lists of the censors.
*the tax which depended upon the valuation in the census. The Lexicons will supply examples of these meanings. &lt;!-- Huh? What does this second sentence mean? --&gt;

===''Regimen morum''===
Keeping the public morals (''regimen morum'', or in the [[Roman Empire|empire]] ''cura morum'' or ''praefectura morum'') was the second most &lt;!-- I say second most, since conducting the census was the first most important duty, as I read up above. --&gt; important branch of the censors' duties, and the one which caused their office to be one of the most revered and the most dreaded in the Roman state; hence they were also known as ''Castigatores'' (&quot;chastisers&quot;). It naturally grew out of the right which they possessed of excluding  persons from the lists of citizens; for, as has been well remarked, &quot;they would, in the first place, be the sole judges of many questions of fact, such as whether a citizen had the qualifications required by law or custom for the rank which he claimed, or whether he had ever incurred any judicial sentence, which rendered him infamous: but from thence the transition was easy, according to Roman notions, to the decisions of questions of right; such as whether a citizen was really worthy of retaining his rank, whether he had not committed some act as justly degrading as those which incurred the sentence of the law.&quot; &lt;!-- A source for this quote would be nice. --&gt;

In this manner, the censors gradually assumed at least nominal complete superintendence over the whole public and private life of every citizen. They were constituted as the conservators of public morality; they were not simply to prevent crime or particular acts of immorality, but rather to maintain the traditional Roman character, ethics, and habits (''mos majorum'')—''regimen morum'' also encompassed this protection of traditional ways,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''de Legibus'' iii.3; Livy iv.8, xxiv.18, xl.46, xli.27, xlii.3; Suetonius ''Life of Augustus'' 27.&lt;/ref&gt; which was called in the times of the [[Roman Empire|empire]] ''cura'' (&quot;supervision&quot;) or ''praefectura'' (&quot;command&quot;). The punishment inflicted by the censors in the exercise of this branch of their duties was called ''nota'' (&quot;mark, letter&quot;) or ''notatio'', or ''animadversio censoria'' (&quot;censorial reproach&quot;). In inflicting it, they were guided only by their conscientious convictions of duty; they had to take an oath that they would act biased by neither partiality nor favour; and, in addition to this, they were bound in every case to state in their lists, opposite the name of the guilty citizen, the cause of the punishment inflicted on him, ''Subscriptio censoria''.&lt;ref&gt;Livy xxxix.42; Cicero ''[[pro Cluentio Oratio]]'' 42‑48; Gell. iv.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

This part of the censors' office invested them with a peculiar kind of jurisdiction, which in many respects resembled the exercise of public opinion in modern times; for there are innumerable actions which, though acknowledged by every one to be prejudicial and immoral, still do not come within the reach of the positive laws of a country; as often said, &quot;immorality does not equal illegality&quot;. Even in cases of real crimes, the positive laws frequently punish only the particular offence, while in public opinion the offender, even after he has undergone punishment, is still incapacitated for certain honours and distinctions which are granted only to persons of unblemished character.

Hence the Roman censors might brand a man with their &quot;censorial mark&quot; (''nota censoria'') in case he had been convicted of a crime in an ordinary court of justice, and had already suffered punishment for it. The consequence of such a nota was only ''[[ignominia]]'' and not ''[[infamia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''[[de Re Publica]]'' iv.6.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Infamia'' and the censorial verdict was not a ''judicium'' or ''res judicata'',&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''pro Cluentio Oratio'' 42.&lt;/ref&gt; for its effects were not lasting, but might be removed by the following censors, or by a ''[[lex]]'' (roughly &quot;law&quot;). A censorial mark was moreover not valid unless both censors agreed. The ''ignominia'' was thus only a transitory reduction of status, which does not even appear to have deprived a magistrate of his office,&lt;ref&gt;(Livy xxiv.18.&lt;/ref&gt; and certainly did not disqualify persons labouring under it for obtaining a magistracy, for being appointed as ''[[Judex|judices]]'' by the [[praetor]], or for serving in the [[Roman army|Roman armies]]. [[Mamercus Aemilius]] was thus, notwithstanding the reproach of the censors (''animadversio censoria''), made [[Roman dictator|dictator]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy iv.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

A person might be branded with a censorial mark in a variety of cases, which it would be impossible to specify, as in a great many instances it depended upon the discretion of the censors and the view they took of a case; and sometimes even one set of censors would overlook an offence which was severely chastised by their successors.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''[[de Senectute]]'' 12.&lt;/ref&gt; But the offences which are recorded to have been punished by the censors are of a threefold nature.
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Such as occurred in the private life of individuals, e.g.
&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Living in celibacy at a time when a person ought to be married to provide the state with citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus ii.9 §1.&lt;/ref&gt; The obligation of marrying was frequently impressed upon the citizens by the censors, and the refusal to fulfil it was punished with a fine (''[[aes uxorium]]'').
&lt;li&gt;The dissolution of matrimony or betrothment in an improper way, or for insufficient reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus ii.9 §2.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improper conduct towards one's wife or children, as well as harshness or too great indulgence towards children, and disobedience of the latter towards their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Life of Cato the Elder'' 17; cf. Cicero ''de Re Publica'' iv.6; Dionys. xx.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inordinate and luxurious mode of living, or an extravagant expenditure of money. A great many instances of this kind are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Livy ''Periochae'' 14, xxxix.4; Plutarch ''Life of Cato the Elder'' 18; Gellius, iv.8; Valerius Maximus ii.9 §4.&lt;/ref&gt; At a later time the ''[[Sumptuary laws|leges sumtuariae]]'' were made to check the growing love of luxuries.
&lt;li&gt;Neglect and carelessness in cultivating one's fields.&lt;ref&gt;Auli Gellii iv.12; Pliny ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' xviii.3.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Cruelty towards slaves or clients.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius xx.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The carrying on of a disreputable trade or occupation,&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius, l.c.&lt;/ref&gt; such as acting in theatres.&lt;ref&gt;Livy vii.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legacy-hunting, defrauding orphans, &amp;c.&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offences committed in public life, either in the capacity of a public officer or against magistrates,
&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a magistrate acted in a manner not befitting his dignity as an officer, if he was accessible to bribes, or forged auspices.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''[[de Senectute]]'' 12; Livy xxxix. 42; Valerius Maximus ii. 9. § 3; Plutarch ''Cato Major'' 17; Cicero ''[[De Divinatione]]'' i. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improper conduct towards a magistrate, or the attempt to limit his power or to abrogate a law which the censors thought necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Livy iv. 24; Cicero ''[[de Oratore]]'' ii. 64; Valerius Maximus ii. 9. § 5; Gellius, iv. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perjury.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''[[de Oratore]]'' i. 13; Livy xxiv. 18; Gellius vii. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neglect, disobedience, and cowardice of soldiers in the army.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximux ii. 9. § 7; Livy. xxiv. 18, xxvii. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The keeping of the [[equus publicus]] in bad condition.&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A variety of actions or pursuits which were thought to be injurious to public morality, might be forbidden by an edict,&lt;ref&gt;Gellius, xv.11.&lt;/ref&gt; and those who acted contrary to such edicts were branded with the nota and degraded. For an enumeration of the offences that might be punished by the censors with ''ignominia'', see Niebuhr.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Rome'', vol. ii p399, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

A person who had been branded with a ''nota censoria'', might, if he considered himself wronged, endeavour to prove his innocence to the censors,&lt;ref&gt;''causam agere apud censores'', Varro ''de re Rustica'' i.7.&lt;/ref&gt; and if he did not succeed, he might try to gain the protection of one of the censors, that he might intercede on his behalf.

====Punishments====
The punishments inflicted by the censors generally differed according to the station which a man occupied, though sometimes a person of the highest rank might suffer all the punishments at once, by being degraded to the lowest class of citizens. But they are generally divided into four classes:

#''Motio'' (&quot;removal&quot;) or ''ejectio e senatu'' (&quot;ejection from the Senate&quot;), or the exclusion of a man from the ranks of senators. This punishment might either be a simple exclusion from the list of senators, or the person might at the same time be excluded from the tribes and degraded to the rank of an aerarian.&lt;ref&gt;Liv. xxiv.18.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter course seems to have been seldom adopted; the ordinary mode of inflicting the punishment was simply this: the censors in their new lists omitted the names of such senators as they wished to exclude, and in reading these new lists in public, quietly omitted the names of those who were no longer to be senators. Hence the expression ''praeteriti senatores'' (&quot;senators passed over&quot;) is equivalent to ''e senatu ejecti'' (those removed from the senate).&lt;ref&gt;Livy xxxviii.28, xxvii.11, xxxiv.44; Festus, s.v. Praeteriti.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/br&gt;In some cases, however, the censors did not acquiesce to this simple mode of proceeding, but addressed the senator whom they had noted, and publicly reprimanded him for his conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Livy xxiv.18.&lt;/ref&gt; As, however, in ordinary cases an ex-senator was not disqualified by his ''ignominia'' for holding any of the magistracies which opened the way to the senate, he might at the next census again become a senator.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''pro Cluentio Oratio'' 42, Plutarch ''Life of Cicero'' 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The ''ademptio equi'', or the taking away the publicly-funded horse from an [[eques]]trian. This punishment might likewise be simple, or combined with the exclusion from the tribes and the degradation to the rank of an [[aerarian]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy xxiv.18, 43, xxvii.11, xxix.37, xliii.16.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The ''motio e tribu'', or the exclusion of a person from his tribe. This punishment and the degradation to the rank of an aerarian were originally the same; but when in the course of time a distinction was made between the rural or rustic tribes and the urban tribes, the ''motio e tribu'' transferred a person from the rustic tribes to the less respectable city tribes, and if the further degradation to the rank of an aerarian was combined with the ''motio e tribu'', it was always expressly stated.&lt;ref&gt;Liv. xlv.15, Plin. H.N. xviii.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The fourth punishment was called ''referre in aerarios''&lt;ref&gt;Livy xxiv.18; Cicero ''pro Cluentio Oratio'' 43.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''facere aliquem aerarium'',&lt;ref&gt;Livy xliii.43.&lt;/ref&gt; and might be inflicted on any person who was thought by the censors to deserve it. This degradation, properly speaking, included all the other punishments, for an equestrian could not be made an ''aerarius'' unless he was previously deprived of his horse, nor could a member of a rustic tribe be made an ''aerarius'' unless he was previously excluded from it.&lt;ref&gt;Livy iv.24, xxiv.18, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was this authority of the Roman censors which eventually developed into the modern meaning of &quot;[[Censor]]&quot; and &quot;[[censorship]]&quot;—i.e., officials who review published material and forbid the publication of material judged to be contrary to &quot;public morality&quot; as the term is interpreted in a given political and social environment.

===Administration of the finances of the state===
The administration of the state's finances was another part of the censors' office. In the first place the ''[[tributum]]'', or property-tax, had to be paid by each citizen according to the amount of his property registered in the census, and, accordingly, the regulation of this tax naturally fell under the jurisdiction of the censors.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Livy xxxix.44.&lt;/ref&gt; They also had the superintendence of all the other revenues of the state, the ''[[vectigalia]]'', such as the tithes paid for the public lands, the [[salt]] works, the mines, the customs, etc.

The censors typically auctioned off to the highest bidder for the space of a ''lustrum'' the collection of the tithes and taxes ([[tax farming]]). This auctioning was called ''venditio'' or ''locatio'', and seems to have taken place in the month of March,&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]] ''[[Macrobius#Saturnalia|Saturnalia]]'' i.12.&lt;/ref&gt; in a public place in Rome&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''de Lege Agraria'' i.3, ii.21.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms on which they were let, together with the rights and duties of the purchasers, were all specified in the ''leges censoriae'', which the censors published in every case before the bidding commenced.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''ad Qu. Fr.'' i.1 §12, ''[[In Verrem]]'' iii.7, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' iii.19, Varro ''de re rustica'' ii.1.&lt;/ref&gt; For further particulars see [[Publicani]].

The censors also possessed the right, though probably not without the assent of the Senate, of imposing new ''vectigalia'',&lt;ref&gt;Livy xxix.37, xl.51.&lt;/ref&gt; and even of selling the land belonging to the state.&lt;ref&gt;Livy xxxii.7.&lt;/ref&gt; It would thus appear that it was the duty of the censors to bring forward a budget for a five-year period, and to take care that the income of the state was sufficient for its expenditure during that time. In part, their duties resembled those of a modern [[minister of finance]]. The censors, however, did not receive the revenues of the state. All the public money was paid into the ''[[aerarium]]'', which was entirely under the jurisdiction of the senate; and all disbursements were made by order of this body, which employed the [[quaestor]]s as its officers.

In one important department the censors were entrusted with the expenditure of the public money, though the actual payments were no doubt made by the quaestors. The censors had the general superintendence of all the public buildings and works (''opera publica''), and to meet the expenses connected with this part of their duties, the senate voted them a certain sum of money or certain revenues, to which they were restricted, but which they might at the same time employ according to their discretion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]] vi.13; Livy xl.46, xliv.16.&lt;/ref&gt; They had to see that the temples and all other public buildings were in a good state of repair,&lt;ref&gt;''[[aedes]] sacras tueri'' and ''sarta tecta exigere'', Livy xxiv.18, xxix.37, xlii.3, xlv.15.&lt;/ref&gt; that no public places were encroached upon by the occupation of private persons,&lt;ref&gt;''loca tueri'', Livy xlii.3, xliii.16.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueduct]], roads, drains, etc. were properly attended to.

The repairs of the public works and the keeping of them in proper condition were let out by the censors by [[public auction]] to the lowest bidder, just as the ''vectigalia'' were let out to the highest bidder. These expenses were called ''[[ultrotributa]]'', and hence we frequently find ''vectigalia'' and ''ultrotributa'' contrasted with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Livy xxxix.44, xliii.16.&lt;/ref&gt; The persons who undertook the contract were called ''conductores'', ''mancipes'', ''redemptores'', ''susceptores'', etc.; and the duties they had to discharge were specified in the [[Leges Censoriae]]. The censors had also to superintend the expenses connected with the worship of the gods, even for instance the feeding of the sacred geese in the Capitol; these various tasks were also let out on contract.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''[[Roman Questions]]'' 98; Pliny ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' x.22; Cicero ''[[pro Sexto Roscio Amerino Oratio]]'' 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides keeping existing public buildings and facilities in a proper state of repair, the censors were also in charge of constructing new ones, either for ornament or utility, both in Rome and in other parts of Italy, such as temples, [[basilica]]e, [[theatre]]s, porticoes, [[Roman Forum|fora]], walls of towns, [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]], harbours, bridges, cloacae, roads, etc. These works were either performed by them jointly, or they divided between them the money, which had been granted to them by the senate.&lt;ref&gt;Liv. xl.51, xliv.16.&lt;/ref&gt; They were let out to contractors, like the other works mentioned above, and when they were completed, the censors had to see that the work was performed in accordance with the contract: this was called ''opus probare'' or ''in acceptum referre''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''In Verrem'' i.57; Livy iv.22, xlv.15; Lex Puteol. p73, Spang.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aedile]]s had likewise a superintendence over the public buildings, and it is not easy to define with accuracy the respective duties of the censors and aediles, but it may be remarked in general that the superintendence of the aediles had more of a police character, while that of the censors were more financial in subject matter.

===Lustrum===
After the censors had performed their various duties and taken the five-yearly census, the ''[[lustrum]]'', a solemn purification of the people, followed. When the censors entered upon their office, they drew lots to see which of them should perform this purification;&lt;ref&gt;''lustrum facere'' or ''condere'', Varro ''De lingua Latina'' vi.86; Livy xxix.37, xxxv.9, xxxviii.36, xlii.10.&lt;/ref&gt; but both censors were of course obliged to be present at the ceremony.

Long after the Roman census was no longer taken, the Latin word ''lustrum'' has survived, and been adopted in some modern languages, in the derived sense of a period of five years, i.e. half a decennium.

The entire line segment lies in the interior of the convex set|A convex set.]]
[[Image:Convex polygon illustration2.png|right|thumb|alt=Illustration of a non-convex set, which looks somewhat like a boomerang or wedge. A (green) non-convex convex set contains the (black) line-segment joining the points x and y. Part of the line segment lies outside of the (green) non-convex set.|A non-convex set, with a line-segment outside the set.]]
In [[Euclidean space]], an object is '''convex''' if for every pair of points within the object, every point on the [[straight line]] segment that joins them is also within the object. For example, a solid [[cube (geometry)|cube]] is convex, but anything that is hollow or has a dent in it, for example, a [[crescent]] shape, is not convex.

The notion can be generalized to other spaces as described below.

== In vector spaces ==
[[Image:Convex supergraph.png|right|thumb|A [[convex function|function]] is convex if and only if the region (in green) above its [[graph of a function|graph]] (in blue) is a convex set.]]
Let ''S'' be a [[vector space]] over the [[real number]]s, or, more generally, some [[ordered field]]. This includes Euclidean spaces. A [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''C'' in ''S'' is said to be '''convex''' if, for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''C'' and all ''t''   in the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,1], the point 

:(1 &amp;minus; ''t''   ) ''x'' + ''t y''

is in ''C''. In other words, every point on the [[line segment]] connecting ''x'' and ''y'' is in ''C''. This implies that a convex set in a [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] [[topological vector space]] is [[path-connected]], thus [[connected space|connected]].

A set ''C'' is called [[absolutely convex]] if it is convex and [[balanced set|balanced]].

The convex [[subset]]s of '''R''' (the set of real numbers) are simply the intervals of '''R'''.
Some examples of convex subsets of [[Euclidean space|Euclidean 2-space]] are [[regular polygon]]s and [[curve of constant width|bodies of constant width]].
Some examples of convex subsets of [[Euclidean space|Euclidean 3-space]] are the [[Archimedean solid]]s and the [[Platonic solid]]s. The [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]] are examples of non-convex sets.

== Properties ==

If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a convex set, for any &lt;math&gt;u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_r&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and any [[negative number|nonnegative number]]s &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_r &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\cdots+\lambda_r=1&lt;/math&gt;, then the vector
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^r\lambda_k u_k&lt;/math&gt;
is in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  A vector of this type is known as a [[convex combination]] of &lt;math&gt;u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_r&lt;/math&gt;.

===Intersections and unions===

The collection of convex subsets of a vector space has the following properties:&lt;ref name=&quot;Soltan&quot; &gt; 
Soltan, Valeriu, ''Introduction to the Axiomatic Theory of Convexity'', Ştiinţa, [[Chişinău]], 1984 (in Russian).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer&quot; &gt;
{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Ivan|title=Abstract convex analysis|series=Canadian Mathematical Society series of monographs and advanced texts|publisher=John Wiley&amp;nbsp;&amp;&amp;nbsp;Sons, Inc.|location=New&amp;nbsp;York|year= 1997|pages=xxii+491|isbn=0-471-16015-6|id={{MR|1461544}}|}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[empty set]] and the whole vector-space are convex.
#The intersection of any collection of convex sets is convex.
#The ''[[union (sets)|union]]'' of a [[Total order#Chain|non-decreasing]] [[net (mathematics)|sequence]] of convex&amp;nbsp;subsets is a convex&amp;nbsp;set.
For the preceding property of unions of non-decreasing sequences of convex sets, the restriction to nested sets was important: The union of two convex&amp;nbsp;sets need ''not'' be convex.

===Convex hulls===
Every subset ''A'' of the vector space is contained within a smallest convex set (called the [[convex hull]] of ''A''), namely the intersection of all convex sets containing&amp;nbsp;''A''.
The convex-hull operator Conv() has the characteristic properties of a [[closure operator|hull operator]]:
:{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|-
| ''extensive''
| S&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;Conv(S),
|-
| ''[[Monotone_function#Monotonicity_in_order_theory|non-decreasing]]''
| S&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;T implies&amp;nbsp;that Conv(S)&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;Conv(T), and
|-
| ''[[idempotence|idempotent]]''
| Conv(Conv(S)) = Conv(S).
|}
The convex-hull operation is needed for the set of convex sets to form a &lt;!-- complete  --&gt;[[lattice (order)|lattice]], in which the [[join and meet|&quot;''join''&quot; operation]] is the convex hull of the union of two convex sets
: Conv(S)∨Conv(T) = Conv( S&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;T ) = Conv(&amp;nbsp;Conv(S)&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;Conv(T)&amp;nbsp;).
The intersection of any collection of convex sets is itself convex, so the convex subsets of a (real or complex) vector space form a complete [[lattice (order)|lattice]].

===Minkowski addition===
{{Main|Minkowski addition}}
[[File:Minkowski sum.png|thumb|alt=Three squares are shown in the nonnegative quadrant of the Cartesian plane. The square Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=[0,1]×[0,1] is green. The square Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=[1,2]×[1,2] is brown, and it sits inside the turquoise square Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=[1,3]×[1,3].|[[Minkowski addition]] of sets. The &lt;!-- [[Minkowski addition|Minkowski]]&amp;nbsp; --&gt;[[sumset|sum]] of the squares&amp;nbsp;Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=[0,1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and&amp;nbsp;Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=[1,2]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the square&amp;nbsp;Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=[1,3]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.]]

* In a real vector-space, the ''[[Minkowski addition|Minkowski&amp;nbsp;sum]]'' of two (non-empty) sets&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be the [[sumset|set]] S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formed by the addition of vectors element-wise from the summand-sets
: S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; }.
More generally, the ''Minkowski&amp;nbsp;sum'' of a finite&amp;nbsp;family of (non-empty) sets&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;!-- defined to be --&gt; the set &lt;!-- of vectors --&gt; formed by element-wise addition of vectors&lt;!--  from the summand-sets --&gt;
: ∑&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = { ∑&amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; }.

For Minkowski&amp;nbsp;addition, the ''zero set''&amp;nbsp;{0} containing only the [[null vector|zero&amp;nbsp;vector]]&amp;nbsp;0 has [[identity element|special importance]]: For every non-empty subset&amp;nbsp;S of a vector space
: S&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{0} = S;
in algebraic terminology, the zero&amp;nbsp;vector&amp;nbsp;0 is the [[identity element]] of Minkowski addition (on the collection of non-empty sets).&lt;ref&gt;
The [[empty set]] is important in Minkowski addition, because the empty&amp;nbsp;set annihilates every other subset: For every  subset&amp;nbsp;S of a vector space, its sum with the empty set is empty
: S+∅ = ∅. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Convex hulls of Minkowski sums====

Minkowski addition behaves well with respect to the operation of taking convex hulls, as shown by the following proposition: 
* For all subsets&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of a real vector-space, the [[convex hull]] of their Minkowski&amp;nbsp;sum is the Minkowski&amp;nbsp;sum of their convex hulls
: Conv(&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;) = Conv(&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;) + Conv(&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;).
This result holds more generally for each finite&amp;nbsp;collection of non-empty sets
: Conv(&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;∑&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp;) = ∑&amp;nbsp;Conv(&amp;nbsp;S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;).
In mathematical terminology, the [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s of Minkowski summation and of forming [[convex hull]]s are [[commutativity|commuting]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem&amp;nbsp;3 (pages&amp;nbsp;562–563): {{cite article|first1=M.|last1=Krein|authorlink1=Mark Krein|first2=V.|last2=Šmulian|year=1940|title=On regularly convex sets in the space conjugate to a Banach space|journal=Annals of Mathematics&amp;nbsp;(2), Second series|volume=41|pages=556–583|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1968735|doi=10.2307/1968735|id={{MR|2009}}.{{jstor|1968735}}|}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;&gt; For the commutativity of [[Minkowski sum|Minkowski addition]] and [[convex hull|convexification]], see Theorem&amp;nbsp;1.1.2 (pages&amp;nbsp;2–3) in Schneider; this reference discusses much of the literature on the [[convex hull]]s of [[Minkowski addition|Minkowski]] [[sumset]]s in its &quot;Chapter&amp;nbsp;3 Minkowski addition&quot; (pages&amp;nbsp;126–196): {{cite book|last=Schneider|first=Rolf|title=Convex bodies: The Brunn–Minkowski theory|series=Encyclopedia of mathematics and its applications|volume=44|publisher=Cambridge&amp;nbsp;University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1993|pages=xiv+490 |isbn=0-521-35220-7|id={{MR|1216521}}|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closed convex sets===
[[closed set|Closed]] convex sets can be characterised as the intersections of ''closed [[half-space]]s'' (sets of point in space that lie on and to one side of a [[hyperplane]]). From what has just been said, it is clear that such intersections are convex, and they will also be closed sets. To prove the converse, i.e., every convex set may be represented as such intersection, one needs the [[supporting hyperplane theorem]] in the form that for a given closed convex set ''C'' and point ''P'' outside it, there is a closed half-space ''H'' that contains ''C'' and not ''P''. The supporting hyperplane theorem is a special case of the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] of [[functional analysis]].

The Minkowski sum of two compact convex sets is closed, as is the sum of a compact convex set and a closed convex set.&lt;ref&gt; [[R. T. Rockafellar]], ''Convex analysis,'' Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1970. Reprint: 1997.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations and extensions for convexity==

The notion of convexity in the Euclidean space may be generalized by modifying the definition in some or other aspects. The common name &quot;generalized convexity&quot; is used, because the resulting objects retain certain properties of convex sets. 

===Star-convex sets===
{{main|Star domain}}
Let ''C'' be a set in a real or complex vector space. ''C'' is '''star convex''' if there exists an &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; in ''C'' such that the line segment from &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; to any point ''y'' in ''C'' is contained in ''C''. Hence a non-empty convex set is always star-convex but a star-convex set is not always convex.

===Orthogonal convexity===
{{main|Orthogonal convex hull}}
An example of generalized convexity is '''orthogonal convexity'''. &lt;ref&gt;Rawlins G.J.E. and Wood D, &quot;Ortho-convexity and its generalizations&quot;,  in: ''Computational Morphology'', 137-152. [[Elsevier]], 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

A set ''S'' in the Euclidean space is called '''orthogonally convex''' or '''orthoconvex''', if any segment parallel to any of the coordinate axes connecting two points of ''S'' lies totally within ''S''. It is easy to prove that an intersection of any collection of orthoconvex sets is orthoconvex. Some other properties of convex sets are  valid as well.

=== Non-Euclidean geometry ===

The definition of a convex set and a convex hull extends naturally to  [[non-Euclidean geometry]] by defining a [[geodesic convexity|geodesically convex set]] to be one that contains the [[geodesic]]s joining any two points in the set.

=== Order topology ===

Convexity can be extended for a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; endowed with the [[order topology]], using the [[total order]] &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; of the space.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Munkres|Munkres, James]]; ''Topology'', Prentice Hall; 2nd edition (December 28, 1999). ISBN 0-13-181629-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;Y\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;. The subspace &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a convex set if for each pair of points &lt;math&gt;a,b\in Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;, the interval &lt;math&gt;\left( a,b \right) = \left\{ x \in X:a&lt;x&lt;b \right\}&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is convex if and only if &lt;math&gt; \forall a,b\in Y, a&lt;b \Rightarrow \left(a,b\right)\subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Convexity spaces ===

The notion of convexity may be generalised to other objects, if certain properties of convexity are selected as [[axiom]]s. 

Given a set ''X'', a '''convexity''' over ''X'' is a collection &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; of subsets of ''X'' satisfying the following axioms:&lt;ref name=&quot;Soltan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer&quot;/&gt;

#The empty set and ''X'' are in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;
#The intersection of any collection from &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.
#The union of a [[Total order|chain]] (with respect to the [[inclusion relation]]) of elements of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

The elements of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; are called convex sets and the pair (''X'', &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;) is called a '''convexity space'''. For the ordinary convexity, the first two axioms hold, and the third one is trivial.

For an alternative definition of abstract convexity, more suited to [[discrete geometry]], see the ''convex geometries'' associated with [[antimatroid]]s.

Cairo was founded by the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid dynasty]] in the 10th Century, but the land composing the present-day city was the site of national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of [[Old Cairo]]. Cairo is also associated with [[Ancient Egypt]] due to its proximity to the ancient cities of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], [[Giza]] and [[Fustat]] which are nearby to the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]] and the [[Giza Necropolis|pyramids of Giza]].

The English and French names for the city (&quot;Cairo&quot;, and &quot;Le Caire&quot; respectively) are [[Corruption (linguistics)|corruptions]] of its [[Arabic]] name &quot;Al-Qahira&quot;.

===Initial settlements===

The area around present-day Cairo, especially [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], had long been a focal point of [[Ancient Egypt]] due to its strategic location just upstream from the [[Nile Delta]]. However, the origins of the modern city are generally traced back to a series of settlements in the first millennium. Around the turn of the 4th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hawass|Brock|2003|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Memphis was continuing to decline in importance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2009 |title=Memphis (Egypt) |encyclopedia=Encarta |publisher=Microsoft |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573551/memphis_(egypt).html |accessdate=24 July 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQXIiNw|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] established a fortress town along the east bank of the [[Nile]]. This fortress, known as [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon]], remains the oldest structure in the city. It is also situated at the nucleus of Egypt's [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christian]] community, which separated from the Roman and Byzantine church in the late 4th century. Many of Cairo's oldest Coptic churches, including [[The Hanging Church]], are located along the fortress walls in a section of the city known as [[Coptic Cairo]].

After the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] in 641, [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] commander [['Amr ibn al-'As]] established [[Fustat]] just north of Cairo and Babylon. At Caliph [[Umar|Umar's]] request, the Egyptian capital was moved from [[Alexandria]] to the new city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Butler|2008|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fustat also became a regional centre of [[Islam]] and home to the [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]], the first [[mosque]] in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Butler|2008|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] usurped the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] in 750, they moved the capital to [[al-Askar]], which they had built just north of Fustat. In 868, under the [[Tulunids]], Egypt's capital was moved further north to their own settlement, [[al-Qatta'i]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=23–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither al-Askar nor al-Qatta'i achieved the prominence of Fustat; al-Askar had become indistinguishable from Fustat by the end of the 9th century, and al-Qatta'i was destroyed by the Abbasids when they recaptured Egypt in 905. With the Abbasids' second conquest, Fustat once again became the capital of Egypt. According to [[Encyclopædia Americana]], the city was founded by the second caliph, [[Omar ibn al-Khattāb]].&lt;ref name=Umar&gt;[http://www.agepedia.org/wiki/OMAR_I The American Encyclopedia of 1851]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation and expansion===
{{See|History of Arab Egypt}}
{{See also|Saladin in Egypt}}

[[File:Muizz Street 2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Muizz Street]], stretching from the [[Bab al-Fotouh|Northern Gates]] of Cairo to the [[Bab Zuweila|Southern Gates]] of the Newly Created city, was the city's first paved street, and the largest street as well.]]

In 969, led by General [[Gawhar al-Siqilli]], the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] conquered [[Egypt]] from [[Tunisia]] and established a new fortified city northeast of [[Fustat]]. It took four years for Jawhar to build the city, initially known as al-Manṣūriyyah,&lt;ref name=&quot;glsm96&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later took its Modern name, Al-Qahira (Cairo) which was to serve as the new capital of the caliphate. During that time, Jawhar also commissioned the construction of [[al-Azhar Mosque]], which developed into the third-oldest university in the world. Cairo would eventually became a centre of learning, with the library of Cairo containing hundreds of thousands of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meri|Bacharach|2006|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Caliph [[Al-Muizz Lideenillah|al-Mu'izz li Din Allah]] finally arrived from the old Fatimid capital of [[Mahdia]] in [[Tunisia]] in 973, the city was given its present name, ''al-Qahira'' (&quot;The Victorious&quot;), in reference to the caliph.&lt;ref name=&quot;glsm96&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Cairo-citadel-1800s.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Cairo Citadel]], seen above in the late 19th century, was built between 1176 and 1183|alt=A multi-domed mosque dominates the walled Citadel, with ruined tombs and a lone minaret in front.]]
For nearly two hundred years after Cairo was established, the administrative centre of Egypt remained in [[Fustat]]. However, in 1168, the Fatamids, under the leadership of [[Vizier]] [[Shawar]], set fire to Fustat to prevent Cairo's capture by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daly|Petry|1998|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt's capital was permanently moved to Cairo, which eventually expanded to include the ruins of Fustat and the previous capitals of [[al-Askar]] and [[al-Qatta'i]]. While the Fustat fire successfully protected the city of Cairo, a continuing power struggle between Shawar, [[List of Kings of Jerusalem|King]] [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]], and [[Greater Syria|Syrian]] general [[Shirkuh]] led to the downfall of the Fatimid establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daly|Petry|1998|pp=213–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1169, [[Saladin]] was appointed as the new vizier of Egypt and, two years later, he would seize power from the family of the last Fatimid caliph, [[Al-'Āḍid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daly|Petry|1998|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the first [[Sultan of Egypt]], Saladin established the [[Ayyubid dynasty]], based in Cairo , and aligned Egypt with the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], who were based in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign, Saladin also constructed the [[Cairo Citadel|Citadel]], which served as the seat of Egyptian government until the mid-19th century.

In 1250, slave soldiers, known as the [[Mamluk]]s, seized Egypt and, like many of their predecessors, established Cairo as the capital of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|their new dynasty]]. Continuing a practice started by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]], much of the land occupied by former [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] palaces was sold and replaced by newer buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction projects initiated by the Mamluks pushed the city outward while also bringing new infrastructure to the centre of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=120–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Cairo flourished as a centre of [[Islamic studies|Islamic scholarship]] and a crossroads on the [[spice trade]] route between Europe and Asia. By 1340, Cairo had a population of close to half a million, making it the largest city west of [[China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sh199&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it avoided [[Europe|Europe's]] stagnation during the [[Late Middle Ages]], Cairo could not escape the [[Black Death]], which struck the city more than fifty times between 1348 and 1517.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shoshan|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its initial, and most deadly, waves, approximately 200,000 people were killed by the plague,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryne|2004|pp=104–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, by the 15th century, Cairo's population had been reduced to between 150,000 and 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shoshan|2002|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's status was further diminished after [[Vasco da Gama]] discovered a sea route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]], thereby allowing spice traders to avoid Cairo.&lt;ref name=&quot;sh199&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Cairo Panoramic View 03.png|thumb|left|Cairo during the sunset, minutes before the maghrib Prayer, from the Azhar park, with the Iconic Ottoman Mosque of Muhammed Ali in 2010]]

Cairo's political influence diminished significantly after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] supplanted [[Mamluk]] power over [[Egypt]] in 1517. Ruling from [[Istanbul]], [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Selim I]] relegated Egypt to a mere [[province]], with Cairo as its capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;sh447&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=447}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the history of Cairo during Ottoman times is often described as inconsequential, especially in comparison to other time periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;sh199&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://menic.utexas.edu/cairo/history/ottoman/ottoman.html |publisher=The University of Texas Center for Middle Eastern Studies |title=Ottoman Cairo |year=1995 |last=Rose |first=Christopher |coauthors=Linda Boxberger |work=Cairo: Living Past, Living Future |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wi225&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|1992|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the 16th and 17th centuries, Cairo remained an important economic and cultural centre. Although no longer on the spice route, the city facilitated the transportation of [[Yemen]]i [[coffee]] and [[India]]n [[textile]]s, primarily to [[Anatolia]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Balkans]]. Cairene merchants were instrumental in bringing goods to the barren [[Hejaz]], especially during the annual [[hajj]] to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wi225&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|İnalcık|Faroqhi|Quataert|McGowan|1997|pp=507–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this same period that [[al-Azhar University]] reached the predominance among Islamic schools that it continues to hold today;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|2004|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daly|Petry|1998|pp=94–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; pilgrims on their way to hajj often attested to the superiority of the institution, which had become associated with Egypt's body of [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|2004|pp=115–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century, Cairo also had [[Tower block|high-rise]] [[apartment|apartment building]]s where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were [[renting|rented]] out to [[Leasehold estate|tenants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Traditional Islamic principles of built environment|first=Hisham|last=Mortada|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2003|isbn=0700717005|page=viii|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Ottomans, Cairo expanded south and west from its nucleus around the [[Cairo Citadel|Citadel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|1992|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was the second-largest in the empire, behind only Istanbul, and, although migration was not the primary source of Cairo's growth, twenty percent of its population at the end of the 18th century consisted of religious minorities and foreigners from around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wi2267&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|1992|pp=226–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, when [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] arrived in Cairo in 1798, the city's population was less than 300,000, forty percent lower than it was at the height of Mamluk—and Cairene—influence in the mid-14th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;sh199&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wi2267&quot; /&gt;

The [[Campaign of Egypt|French occupation]] was short-lived as [[British Empire|British]] and Ottoman forces, including a sizable [[Albanians|Albanian]] contingent, recaptured the country in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sicker|2001|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British vacated Egypt two years later, leaving the Ottomans, the Albanians, and the long-weakened [[Mamluk]]s jostling for control of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sicker|2001|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Afaf Lutfi Sayyid-Marsot|1984|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued civil war allowed an Albanian named [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] to ascend to the role of [[commander]] and eventually, with the approval of the [[ulema|religious establishment]], viceroy of Egypt in 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sicker|2001|pp=104–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
{{See|History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty|History of modern Egypt}}
Until his death in 1848, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] instituted a number of social and economic reforms that earned him the title of founder of modern Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Afaf Lutfi Sayyid-Marsot|1984|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGregor|2006|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Muhammad Ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; those reforms had minimal effect on Cairo's landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=291, 302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bigger changes came to Cairo under [[Isma'il Pasha]] (r. 1863–1879), who continued the modernization processes started by his grandfather. Drawing inspiration from [[Paris]], Isma'il environs a city of maidans and wide avenues; due to financial constraints, only some of them, in the area now composing [[Downtown Cairo]], came to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=313–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isma'il also sought to modernize the city, which was merging with neighboring settlements, by establishing a [[public works]] ministry, bringing [[natural gas|gas]] and lighting to the city, and opening a theater and opera house.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=311–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abu-Lughod|1965|pp=436–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cairo Nile Towers.png|left|thumb|Today, high-rise buildings line the eastern edge of the Nile in central Cairo|alt=High-rises, including a multi-storey white building in the foreground, dominate a sunset view of Cairo alongside the Nile, which is shown flowing under a bridge carrying a busy street]]
[[File:Cairo - Garden City - Four Seasons Hotel from the Nile.JPG|right|thumb|Four Seasons Hotel in Cairo]]
The immense debt resulting from Isma'il's projects provided a pretext for increasing European control, which culminated with the [[1882 Anglo-Egyptian War|British invasion]] in 1882.&lt;ref name=&quot;sh199&quot; /&gt; The city's economic centre quickly moved west toward the [[Nile]], away from the historic [[Islamic Cairo]] section and toward the contemporary, European-style areas built by Isma'il.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abu-Lughod|1965|pp=429–31, 455–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hokhwi317&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hourani|Khoury|Wilson|2004|p=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans accounted for five percent of Cairo's population at the end of the 19th century, by which point they held most top governmental positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abu-Lughod|1965|p=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The British occupation was intended to be temporary, but it lasted well into the 20th century. Nationalists staged [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|large-scale demonstrations]] in Cairo in 1919,&lt;ref name=&quot;sh199&quot; /&gt; five years after Egypt had been declared a British [[protectorate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hokhwi317&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hourani|Khoury|Wilson|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, while this led to Egypt's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|independence in 1922]], British troops remained in the country until 1956. During this time, urban Cairo, spurred by new bridges and transport links, continued to in expand to include the upscale neighborhoods of [[Garden City (Cairo)|Garden City]], [[Zamalek]], and [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=326–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1882 and 1937, the population of Cairo more than tripled – from 347,000 to 1.3 million&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and its area increased from {{convert|1000|ha|km2 mi2|0|lk=in}} to {{convert|16300|ha|km2 mi2|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was devastated during the 1952 [[Cairo Fire]], also known as Black Saturday, which saw the destruction of nearly 700 shops, movie theatres, casinos and hotels in Downtown Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ahram.org.eg/433/2011/02/04/457/55/Malafat.aspx |title=خسائر الحريق |date=12 May 2010 |journal=[[Al-Ahram]] |trans_title=The Fire Damage |language=Arabic |accessdate=2011-02-04 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British departed Cairo following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], but the city's rapid growth showed no signs of abating. Seeking to accommodate the increasing population, [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] redeveloped [[Midan Tahrir]] and the Nile [[Corniche]], and improved the city's network of bridges and highways.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|p=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, additional controls of the Nile fostered development within the island of [[Gezira Island|Gezira]] and along the city's waterfront. The metropolis began to encroach on the fertile [[Nile Delta]], prompting the government to build desert [[satellite town]]s and devise incentives for city-dwellers to move to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raymond|2000|pp=343–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these efforts, Cairo's population has doubled since the 1960s, reaching close to seven million (with an additional ten million in its [[urban area]]). Concurrently, Cairo has established itself as a political and economic hub for [[North Africa]] and the [[Arab world|Arab World]], with many multinational businesses and organizations, including the [[Arab League]], operating out of the city.

In 1992, Cairo was hit by a [[1992 Cairo earthquake|damaging earthquake]], that caused 545 deaths, 6512 injuries and left 50,000 people homeless.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGDC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?eq_0=5339&amp;t=101650&amp;s=13&amp;d=22,26,13,12&amp;nd=display|title=NGDC page on the Cairo earthquake|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|right|Cairo's focal point, the [[Nile]], adjacent to the European-inspired districts near the city's centre|alt=A sharp blue river divides the cityscape, which is primarily greenery and sparse low-rise buildings in the foreground, and dense with several modern high-rises in the background]]
Cairo is located in northern [[Egypt]], known as [[Lower Egypt]], {{convert|165|km|mi|-1}} south of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and {{convert|120|km|mi}} west of the [[Gulf of Suez]] and [[Suez Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=cairo+to+suez |work=WolframAlpha |publisher=Wolfram Research |accessdate=10 September 2009 |title=Cairo to Suez}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is along the [[Nile|Nile River]], immediately south of the point where the river leaves its desert-bound valley and branches into the low-lying [[Nile Delta]] region. Although the Cairo metropolis extends away from the Nile in all directions, the city of Cairo resides only on the east bank of the river and two islands within it on a total area of {{convert|453|km2|mi2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cairo.gov.eg/C17/C8/Cairo%20Maps/default.aspx|publisher=Cairo Governorate|accessdate=10 September 2009|title=Cairo Maps}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;citypop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Egypt.html |publisher=City Population |last=Brinkhoff |first=Thomas |accessdate=12 September 2009 |title=Egypt: Governorates &amp; Cities}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cairo Nile River.jpg|thumb|right|The river [[Nile]] flows through Cairo, here contrasting ancient customs of daily life with the modern city of today.]]

Until the mid-19th century, when the river was tamed by dams, levees, and other controls, the Nile in the vicinity of Cairo was highly susceptible to changes in course and surface level. Over the years, the Nile gradually shifted westward, providing the site between the eastern edge of the river and the [[Mokattam]] highlands on which the city now stands. The land on which Cairo was established in 969 (present-day [[Islamic Cairo]]) was located underwater just over three hundred years earlier, when [[Fustat]] was first built.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2002|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low periods of the Nile during the 11th century continued to add to the landscape of Cairo; a new island, known as ''Geziret al-Fil'', first appeared in 1174, but eventually became connected to the mainland. Today, the site of ''Geziret al-Fil'' is occupied by the [[Shubra]] district. The low periods created another island at the turn of the 14th century that now composes [[Zamalek]] and [[Gezira Island|Gezira]]. [[Land reclamation]] efforts by the [[Mamluk]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] further contributed to expansion on the east bank of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|2002|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Islamic-cairo-street.jpg|left|thumb|The streets of [[Islamic Cairo]], adorned by [[Islamic architecture]], are narrower and older than those in the city centre|alt=Several people walk down a small empty lane overshadowed on both sides by three-story buildings with shrouded balconies and windows of Islamic style]]
Because of the Nile's movement, the newer parts of the city – [[Garden City (Cairo)|Garden City]], [[Downtown Cairo]], and Zamalek – are located closest to the riverbank. The areas, which are home to most of Cairo's [[diplomatic mission|embassies]], are surrounded on the north, east, and south by the older parts of the city. [[Old Cairo]], located south of the centre, holds the remnants of [[Fustat]] and the heart of Egypt's [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christian]] community, [[Coptic Cairo]]. The [[Boulaq]] district, which lies in the northern part of the city, was born out of a major 16th-century port and is now a major industrial centrer. The [[Cairo Citadel|Citadel]] is located east of the city centre around [[Islamic Cairo]], which dates back to the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] era and the foundation of Cairo. While western Cairo is dominated by wide boulevards, open spaces, and [[modern architecture]] of European influence, the eastern half, having grown haphazardly over the centuries, is dominated by small lanes, crowded tenements, and [[Islamic architecture]].

Northern and extreme eastern parts of Cairo, which include [[satellite town]]s, are among the most recent additions to the city, as they developed in the late-20th and early-21st centuries to accommodate the city's rapid growth. The western bank of the Nile is commonly included within the urban area of Cairo, but it composes the city of [[Giza]] and the [[Giza Governorate]]. Giza has also undergone significant expansion over recent years, and today the city, although still a [[suburb]] of Cairo, has a population of 2.7 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;citypop&quot; /&gt; The Cairo Governorate is just north of the [[Helwan Governorate]], which was created in 2008 when some of Cairo's southern districts, including [[Maadi]] and [[New Cairo]], were split off and annexed into the new [[governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/894/eg6.htm |publisher=al-Ahram Weekly |last=Leila |first=Reem |number=894 |date=24–30 April 2008 |accessdate=12 September 2009 |title=Redrawing the Map}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{wide image|Panocairo1.jpg|900px|A panorama of the Nile showing Cairo tower in the middle and two major bridges on the far right and left.}}
In Cairo, and along the Nile River Valley, the climate is a [[desert climate]] (''BWh'' according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |title=World Map of Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification |publisher=Köppen-Geiger |date= |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but often with high humidity due to the river valley's effects. Wind storms can be frequent, bringing [[Mineral dust|Saharan dust]] into the city during the months of March and April. High temperatures in winter range from {{convert|13|°C|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|19|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while night-time lows drop to below {{convert|8|°C|0|abbr=on}}, often to {{convert|5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. In summer, the highs rarely surpass {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}}, and lows drop to about {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Rainfall is sparse, but sudden showers do cause harsh flooding. In [[New Cairo]], a place of higher elevation than down town Cairo, the temperatures often drop below zero during winter causing morning frost. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Health===
{{See also|List of hospitals in Egypt}}
Cairo, as well as neighbouring Giza, has been established as Egypt's main centre for medical treatment, and despite some exceptions, has the most advanced level of [[Health care|medical care]] in the country. Cairo's hospitals include the [[Joint Commission|JCI]]-accredited As-Salam International Hospital - Corniche El Nile; Maadi (Egypt's largest [[private hospital]] with 350 beds), [[Ain Shams University]] Hospital, Dar El Fouad Hospital, as well as [[Kasr El Aini Hospital|Qasr El Ainy General Hospital]].

===Education===
Cairo has long been the hub of education and educational services for Egypt and the region.
Today, Cairo is the centre for many government offices governing the [[Education in Egypt|Egyptian educational system]], has the largest number of educational schools, and [[Egyptian universities|higher learning institutes]] among other cities and governorates of Egypt.

[[File:Ramsesst.jpg|thumb|Ramses Street, one of Cairo's main arteries]]Transportation in Cairo comprises an extensive road network, [[rail system]], [[Rapid transit|subway system]], and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses, and [[Microbus#Van conversions|Cairo microbuses]]. Cairo, specifically Ramses Square, is the centre of almost the entire Egyptian [[transport network|transportation network]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The subway system, officially called &quot;Metro (مترو)&quot;, is a fast and efficient way of getting around Cairo. It can get very crowded during [[rush hour]]. Two train cars (the fourth and fifth ones) are reserved for women only, although women may ride in any car they want.

An extensive road network connects Cairo with other Egyptian cities and villages. There is a new [[Ring road|Ring Road]] that surrounds the outskirts of the city, with exits that reach outer Cairo districts. There are flyovers and bridges, such as the Sixth of October bridge that, when the traffic is not heavy, allow fast {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} [[Mode of transport|means of transportation]] from one side of the city to the other.

Cairo traffic is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/779/feature.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly &amp;#124; Features &amp;#124; Reaching an impasse |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date=2006-02-01 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traffic moves at a relatively fluid pace.

===Sports===
[[File:Cairo International Stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Cairo International Stadium]] with 75,100 seats]]

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular Sport in Egypt, and Cairo has a number of sporting teams that compete in national and regional leagues. The best known teams are [[Al-Ahly]] and [[Zamalek SC|El Zamalek]], whose annual football tournament is perhaps the most watched sports event in Egypt as well as the African and Arabian World. Both teams are known as the &quot;rivals&quot; of Egyptian football, and are the first and the second champions in the African continent and the Arab World. Both teams play their home games at [[Cairo International Stadium]] or Naser Stadium, which is Egypt's 2nd largest stadium, Cairo's largest one and one of the largest stadiums in the world.

The [[Cairo International Stadium]] was built in 1960 and its multi-purpose sports complex that houses the main football stadium, an indoor stadium, several satellite fields that held several regional, continental and global games, including the [[All-Africa Games|African Games]], U17 Football World Championship and was one of the stadiums scheduled that hosted the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|2006 African Nations Cup]] which was played in January, 2006 Egypt later won the competition and went on to win the next edition In Ghana (2008) making the Egyptian and Ghanaian national teams the only teams to win the African cup of nations Back to back which resulted in Egypt winning the title for a record number of six times in African Continental Competition's history. This was followed by a third consecutive win in Angola 2010, making Egypt the only country with a record 3-consecutive and 7-total Continental Football Competition winner. This achievement had also placed the Egyptian football team as the #12 best team in the world's FIFA rankings.

Cairo failed at the applicant stage when bidding for the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympic Games]], which was hosted in Beijing, China. However, Cairo did host the 2007 [[Pan Arab Games|Pan-Arab Games]].

There are several other sports teams in the city that participate in several sports including el Gezira [[Sports club|Sporting Club]], el Shams Club, el Seid Club, Heliopolis Club and several smaller clubs, but the biggest clubs in Egypt (not in area but in sports) are [[Al-Ahly|Al Ahly]] &amp; [[Zamalek|Al Zamalek]]. They have the two biggest football teams in Egypt.

Most of the sports federations of the country are also located in the city suburbs, including the [[Egyptian Football Association]]. The headquarters of the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF) was previously located in Cairo, before relocating to its new headquarters in [[6th of October City|6 October City]], a small city away from Cairo's crowded districts.

On October 2008, the Egyptian Rugby Federation was officially formed and granted membership into the [[International Rugby Board]].

Egypt is internationally known for the excellence of its squash players who excel in both professional and junior divisions. Gizira Club in Zamalek is where former world #1 Amr Shabana and former world #1 Karim Darwish practice. The Heliopolis Club in Heliopolis is the home of current world #1 Ramy Ashour and his brother, world #24, Hisham Ashour. Other major squash-playing venues are The Shooting Club (Nadi el Seid) in Dokki, The Maadi Club in Maadi and Wadi Degla in Degla.

==Culture==
[[File:Tulun mosque.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]], one of the oldest mosques in Cairo]]

Over the ages, and as far back as four thousand years, Egypt stood as the land where [[civilization]]s have always met. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The [[Pharaoh]]s together with the [[Greeks]], [[Babylonians]] and the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] have left their imprints here. [[Muslim]]s from the Arabian Peninsula, led by [['Amr ibn al-'As|Amr ibn al-A'as]], introduced [[Islam]] into Egypt. [[Khedive]] [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammad Ali]], with his Albanian family roots, put Egypt on the road to modernity. If anything, the cultural mix in this country is natural, given its heritage. Egypt can be likened to an open museum with monuments of the different historical periods on display everywhere.

===Cairo Opera House===
{{Main|Cairo Opera House}}
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Cairo Opera House ByDay.jpg|thumb|[[Cairo Opera House]]: one of six in Africa (three in Egypt and three in [[South Africa]])]] --&gt;

President Mubarak inaugurated the new Cairo Opera House of the Egyptian National Cultural Centres on October 10, 1988, 17 years after the Royal Opera House had been destroyed by fire. The National Cultural Centre was built with the help of JICA, the Japan International Co-operation Agency and stands as a prominent feature for the Japanese-Egyptian co-operation and the friendship between these two nations.

Egypt is proud to be the only state in the region which built two [[opera house]]s within a century.

===Khedivial Opera House===
{{Main|Khedivial Opera House}}

The [[Khedivial Opera House]] or Royal Opera House was the original opera house in Cairo, Egypt. It was dedicated on November 1, 1869 and burned down on October 28, 1971. After the original opera house was destroyed, Cairo was without an opera house for nearly two decades until the opening of the new Cairo Opera House in 1988.

===Cairo International Film Festival===
{{Main|Cairo International Film Festival}}
Egypt's love of the arts in general can be traced back to the rich heritage bequeathed by the Pharaohs. In modern times, Egypt has enjoyed a strong cinematic tradition since the art of filmmaking was first developed, early in the 20th century. A natural progression from the active theatre scene of the time, cinema rapidly evolved into a vast motion picture industry. This together with the much older music tradition, raised Egypt to become [[Hollywood]] Middle East and the [[cultural capital]] of the Arab world.

For more than 500 years of [[recorded history]], Egypt has fascinated the West and inspired its creative talents from play writer [[William Shakespeare]], poet and dramatist [[John Dryden]], and novelist and poet [[Lawrence Durrell]] to film producer [[Cecil B. DeMille|Cecil B. de Mille]]. Since the [[silent film|silent movies]] Hollywood has been capitalising on the [[box office|box-office]] returns that come from combining Egyptian stories with visual effects.

Egypt has also been a fount of [[Arabic literature]], producing some of the 20th century's greatest Arab writers such as [[Taha Hussein]] and [[Tawfiq el-Hakim|Tawfiq al-Hakim]] to [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureate]], novelist [[Naguib Mahfouz]]. Each of them has written for the cinema.

With these credentials, it was clear that Cairo should aim to hold an international [[film festival]]. This dream came true on Monday August 16, 1976, when the first [[Cairo International Film Festival]] was launched by the Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics, headed by [[Kamal El-Mallakh]]. The Association ran the festival for seven years until 1983.

This achievement lead to the President of the Festival again contacting the [[FIAPF]] with the request that a competition should be included at the 1991 Festival. The request was granted.

In 1998, the Festival took place under the presidency of one of Egypt's leading actors, [[Hussein Fahmy]], who was appointed by the [[Culture minister|Minister of Culture]], [[Farouk Hosny|Farouk Hosni]], after the death of Saad El-Din Wahba.

Four years later, the journalist and writer Cherif El-Shoubashy became president.

For 33 years The International Festival has awarded dozens of international superstars, including [[John Malkovich]], [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Bud Spencer]], [[Gina Lollobrigida]], [[Ornella Muti]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Claudia Cardinale]], [[Victoria Abril]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Shashi Kapoor]], [[Alain Delon]], [[Goldie Hawn|Goldy Hawn]], [[Kurt Russell]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Greta Scacchi]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Julia Ormond]], [[Mira Sorvino]], [[Stuart Townsend]], [[Alicia Silverstone]], [[Priscilla Presley]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Irene Papas]], [[Marcello Mastroianni]], [[Salma Hayek]], [[Lucy Liu|Lucy liu]], [[Samuel L. Jackson|Samuel Jackson]], [[Tom Berenger]] and [[Omar Sharif]], as well as directors like [[Robert Wise]], [[Elia Kazan]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Oliver Stone]], [[Roland Joffé|Roland Joffe]], [[Carlos Saura]], [[Ismail Merchant]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], in an annual celebration and examination of the state of cinema in the world today. The presidents of the Festival since it was founded in 1976 are [[Saad El-Din Wahba]], [[Hussein Fahmy]] and [[Sherif El Shoubashy]]. This year the festival a milestone of 30 years in an annual celebration and examination of the state of cinema in the world today.

===Cairo Geniza===
{{Main|Cairo Geniza}}

The [[Cairo Geniza]] is an accumulation of almost 200,000 Jewish manuscripts that were found in the genizah of the [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ben Ezra]] synagogue (built 882) of Fostat, Egypt (now Old Cairo), the Basatin cemetery east of Old Cairo, and a number of old documents that were bought in Cairo in the later 19th century. These documents were written from about 870 to as late as 1880 AD and have now been archived in various American and European libraries. The Taylor-Schechter collection in [[University of Cambridge|the University of Cambridge]] runs to 140,000 manuscripts; there are a further 40,000 manuscripts at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]].

==Economy==
[[File:ColArchCairo.jpg|thumb|Old buildings in Downtown Cairo. In the centre is the statue of [[Talaat Harb|Talaat Pasha Harb]], the father of the modern Egyptian economy]]

Cairo is also in every respect the centre of Egypt, as it has been almost since its founding in 969 AD. The majority of the nation's commerce is generated there, or passes through the city. The great majority of [[publishing|publishing houses]] and media outlets and nearly all [[Movie studio|film studio]]s are there, as are half of the nation's hospital beds and universities. This has fueled rapid construction in the city—one building in five is less than 15 years old.

This astonishing growth until recently surged well ahead of [[Municipal services|city services]]. Homes, roads, electricity, telephone and sewer services were all suddenly in short supply. Analysts trying to grasp the magnitude of the change coined terms like &quot;[[hyper-urbanization]]&quot;.

===Tahrir Square===
{{Main|Tahrir Square}}
[[Tahrir Square]] was founded during the mid 19th century with the establishment of modern down-town Cairo. It was first named Ismailia Square, after the 19th-century ruler [[Khedive Ismail]], who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the Nile' design. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] the square became widely known as Tahrir (Liberation) Square. Several notable buildings surround the square including, [[The American University in Cairo]]'s down-town campus, the [[Mogamma]] governmental administrative Building, the headquarters of the [[Arab League]], the Nile Ritz Carlton Hotel, the headquarters of the [[National Democratic Party]], and the [[Egyptian Museum]]. Being at the heart of Cairo, the square witnessed several major protests over the years. However, the most notable event in the square was being the focal point of the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]] against former president [[Hosni Mubarak]].

==Pollution==
Cairo is an expanding city, which has led to many environmental problems. The [[air pollution]] in Cairo is a matter of serious concern. Greater Cairo's volatile [[aromatic hydrocarbon]] levels are higher than many other similar cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Khoder |first=M.I. |title=Ambient levels of volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere of Greater Cairo |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=554–566 |publisher=Air Pollution Research Department, [[National Research Centre]], Dokki, Giza |month=January | year=2007 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VH3-4M69JXB-2/2/78a7f549b20e2c16b3cf7a2f5659e467 |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.08.051 |id=ISSN: 1352-2310 |ref=harv |accessdate=2007-01-01 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air quality measurements in Cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of [[lead]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[sulfur dioxide|sulphur dioxide]], and [[particulate|suspended particulate matter]] concentrations due to decades of unregulated [[vehicle emissions control|vehicle emissions]], urban industrial operations, and chaff and trash burning. There are over 4,500,000 cars on the streets of Cairo, 60% of which are over 10 years old, and therefore lack modern emission cutting features like [[catalytic converter]]s. Cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect.
A mysterious [[Smog|black cloud]] (as Egyptians refer to it) [[Inversion (meteorology)|appears over Cairo every fall]] and causes serious respiratory diseases and eye irritations for the city's citizens. Tourists who are not familiar with such high levels of pollution must take extra care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Black cloud reappears over Cairo|journal=Middle East online|date= |first= |last= |coauthors= |volume=41|issue= 3|page=554|id= |url= |accessdate= |ref=harv|doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.08.051|author=Khoder, M|postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairo also has many unregistered lead and [[copper]] [[smelter]]s which heavily pollute the city. The results of this has been a permanent haze over the city with particulate matter in the air reaching over three times normal levels. It is estimated that 10,000 to 25,000 people a year in Cairo die due to air pollution-related diseases. Lead has been shown to cause harm to the [[central nervous system]] and neurotoxicity particularly in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Lead neurotoxicity in children: basic mechanisms and clinical correlates|journal=Brain|volume=126|issue=1|pages=5–19|month=January | year=2003|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/126/1/5|accessdate=2008-04-19|doi=10.1093/brain/awg014|author=Lidsky, T. I.|pmid=12477693|ref=harv|last2=Schneider|first2=JS|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the first environmental acts were introduced and the situation has seen some improvement with 36 air monitoring stations and [[Emissions testing|emissions tests]] on cars. 20,000 buses have also been commissioned to the city to improve congestion levels, which are very high.

The city also suffers from a high level of [[pollution|land pollution]]. Cairo produces 10,000 tons of waste material each day, 4,000 tons of which is not [[Waste collection|collected]] or [[Waste management|managed]]. This once again is a huge [[health|health hazard]] and the Egyptian Government is looking for ways to combat this. The Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Agency was founded to collect and recycle the waste; however, they also work with the [[Zabbaleen]] (or [[Zabbaleen|Zabaleen]]), a community that has been collecting and recycling Cairo's waste since the turn of the 20th century and live in an area known locally as [[Manshiyat naser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/06/03/MNGKOJ82991.DTL |title=From Cairo's trash, a model of recycling / Old door-to-door method boasts 85% reuse rate |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2006-06-03 |accessdate=2009-05-05 | first=Jack | last=Epstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are working together to pick up as much waste as possible within the city limits, though it remains a pressing problem.

The city also suffers from [[water pollution]] as the [[sewer system]] tends to fail and overflow. On occasion, [[sewage]] has escaped onto the streets to create a health hazard. This problem is hoped to be solved by a new sewer system funded by [[European Union|the European Union]], which could cope with the demand of the city. The dangerously high levels of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in the city's water system has [[global health]] officials concerned over related health risks. There is also more concern about [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]] among Egyptians than before. There is now general awareness and some projects are laid down to help make the public aware of the importance of a clean environment.

'''Chaos theory''' is a field of study in [[applied mathematics]], with applications in several disciplines including [[physics]], [[economics]], [[biology]], and [[philosophy]]. Chaos theory studies the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s that are highly sensitive to initial conditions; an effect which is popularly referred to as the [[butterfly effect]]. Small differences in initial conditions (such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes for chaotic systems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H. Kellert, ''In the Wake of Chaos: Unpredictable Order in Dynamical Systems'', University of Chicago Press, 1993, p 32, ISBN 0-226-42976-8.&lt;/ref&gt; This happens even though these systems are [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]], meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no [[randomness|random]] elements involved.&lt;ref&gt;Kellert, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable.&lt;ref&gt;Kellert, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WerndlCharlotte&quot;&gt;Werndl, Charlotte (2009). ''[http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/60/1/195 What are the New Implications of Chaos for Unpredictability?]''. The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 60, 195-220.&lt;/ref&gt;  This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply ''[[chaos]]''.

Chaotic behavior can be observed in many natural systems, such as the weather.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sneyers&quot;&gt;Raymond Sneyers (1997) &quot;Climate Chaotic Instability: Statistical Determination and Theoretical Background&quot;, ''Environmetrics'', vol. 8, no. 5, pages 517–532.&lt;/ref&gt;  Explanation of such behavior may be sought through analysis of a chaotic [[mathematical model]], or through analytical techniques such as [[recurrence plot]]s and [[Poincaré map]]s.

Chaotic behavior has been observed in the laboratory in a variety of systems including [[electrical circuits]], [[lasers]], [[Oscillation#Chemical|oscillating]] [[chemical reactions]], [[fluid dynamics]], and mechanical and magneto-mechanical devices, as well as computer models of chaotic processes. Observations of chaotic behavior in nature include changes in weather,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sneyers&quot;/&gt; the dynamics of satellites in the [[solar system]], the time evolution of the [[magnetic field of celestial bodies]], population growth in [[ecology]], the dynamics of the [[action potentials]] in [[neuron]]s, and [[molecular vibration]]s.

A successful application of chaos theory is in ecology where dynamical systems such as the [[Ricker model]] have been used to show how population growth under density dependence can lead to chaotic dynamics{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

Chaos theory is also currently being applied to medical studies of [[epilepsy]], specifically to the prediction of seemingly random seizures by observing initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Comdig.org, [http://www.comdig.org/index.php?id_issue=1999.06#194 Complexity Digest 199.06]&lt;/ref&gt;

The motion of ''N'' stars in response to their self-gravity (the [[N-body problem|gravitational ''N''-body problem]]) is generically chaotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In electrical engineering, chaotic systems are used in communications, random number generators, and encryption systems.

In [[numerical analysis]], the [[Newton-Raphson]] method of approximating the [[root of a function|roots]] of a function can lead to chaotic iterations if the function has no real roots.&lt;ref&gt;Strang, Gilbert, &quot;A chaotic search for ''i'',&quot; ''The College Mathematics Journal'' 22(1), January 1991, 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, &quot;[[chaos]]&quot; means &quot;a state of disorder&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of {{linktext|chaos}} at [[Wiktionary]];&lt;/ref&gt; However, in chaos theory, the term  is defined more precisely. Although there is no universally accepted mathematical definition of chaos, a commonly used definition says that, for a dynamical system to be classified as chaotic, it must have the following properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A First Course in Dynamics: With a Panorama of Recent Developments|last=Hasselblatt|first=Boris|coauthors=Anatole Katok|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521587506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#it must be sensitive to initial conditions;
#it must be [[topological mixing|topologically mixing]]; and
#its [[periodic orbit]]s must be [[dense set|dense]].

The requirement for sensitive dependence on initial conditions implies that there is a set of initial conditions of positive measure which do not converge to a cycle of any length.

===Sensitivity to initial conditions===
''Sensitivity to initial conditions'' means that each point in such a system is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points with significantly different future trajectories. Thus, an arbitrarily small perturbation of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behaviour.  However, it has been shown that the last two properties in the list above actually imply sensitivity to initial conditions&lt;ref&gt;Saber N. Elaydi, ''Discrete Chaos'', Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC, 1999, page 117, ISBN 1-58488-002-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William F. Basener, ''Topology and its applications'', Wiley, 2006, page 42, ISBN 0-471-68755-3,&lt;/ref&gt; and if attention is restricted to [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]], the second property implies the other two&lt;ref&gt;Michel Vellekoop; Raoul Berglund, &quot;On Intervals, Transitivity = Chaos,&quot; ''The American Mathematical Monthly'', Vol. 101, No. 4. (April, 1994), pp. 353–355 [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2975629]&lt;/ref&gt; (an alternative, and in general weaker, definition of chaos uses only the first two properties in the above list&lt;ref&gt;Alfredo Medio and Marji Lines, ''Nonlinear Dynamics: A Primer'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, page 165, ISBN 0-521-55874-3.&lt;/ref&gt;). It is interesting that the most practically significant condition, that of sensitivity to initial conditions, is actually redundant in the definition, being implied by two (or for intervals, one) purely [[Topology|topological]] conditions, which are therefore of greater interest to mathematicians.

Sensitivity to initial conditions is popularly known as the &quot;[[butterfly effect]]&quot;, so called because of the title of a paper given by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1972 to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Washington, D.C. entitled ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly’s Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?'' The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events leading to large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different.

A consequence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that if we start with only a finite amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system will no longer be predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead.&lt;ref name=&quot;RGW&quot;&gt;Robert G. Watts, ''Global Warming and the Future of the Earth'', Morgan &amp; Claypool, 2007, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lyapunov exponent]] characterises the extent of the sensitivity to initial conditions. Quantitatively, two [[trajectory|trajectories]] in [[phase space]] with initial separation &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{Z}_0&lt;/math&gt; diverge

:&lt;math&gt; | \delta\mathbf{Z}(t) | \approx e^{\lambda t} | \delta \mathbf{Z}_0 |\ &lt;/math&gt;

where λ is the Lyapunov exponent.  The rate of separation can be different for different orientations of the initial separation vector. Thus, there is a whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents — the number of them is equal to the number of dimensions of the phase space. It is common to just refer to the largest one, i.e. to the Maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE), because it determines the overall predictability of the system. A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic.

There are also measure-theoretic mathematical conditions (discussed in ergodic theory) such as mixing or being a K-system which relate to sensitivity of initial conditions and chaos &lt;ref name=&quot;WerndlCharlotte&quot; /&gt;

===Topological mixing===
[[File:Chaos Topological Mixing.png|thumb|right|200px|The map defined by ''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'') and ''y'' → ''x'' + ''y'' if ''x'' + ''y'' &lt; 1 (''x'' + ''y'' – 1 otherwise) also displays [[topological mixing]]. Here the blue region is transformed by the dynamics first to the purple region, then to the pink and red regions, and eventually to a cloud of points scattered across the space.]]
''[[Topological mixing]]'' (or topological ''transitivity'') means that the system will evolve over time so that any given region or [[open set]] of its phase space will eventually overlap with any other given region. This mathematical concept of &quot;mixing&quot; corresponds to the standard intuition, and the mixing of colored [[dye]]s or fluids is an example of a chaotic system.

Topological mixing is often omitted from popular accounts of chaos, which equate chaos with sensitivity to initial conditions. However, sensitive dependence on initial conditions alone does not give chaos. For example, consider the simple dynamical system produced by repeatedly doubling an initial value. This system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions everywhere, since any pair of nearby points will eventually become widely separated. However, this example has no topological mixing, and therefore has no chaos. Indeed, it has extremely simple behaviour: all points except 0 tend to infinity.

===Density of periodic orbits===
''[[Dense set|Density]] of [[periodic orbit]]s'' means that every point in the space is approached arbitrarily closely by periodic orbits. Topologically mixing systems failing this condition may not display sensitivity to initial conditions, and hence may not be chaotic.  For example, an irrational rotation of the circle is topologically transitive, but does not have dense periodic orbits, and hence does not have sensitive dependence on initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Devaney, Robert L.| title=An Introduction to Chaotic Dynamical Systems, 2nd ed| publisher=Westview Press| year=2003| isbn=0-8133-4085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by ''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'') is one of the simplest systems with density of periodic orbits.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5+\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt; (or approximately 0.3454915 → 0.9045085 → 0.3454915) is an (unstable) orbit of period 2, and similar orbits exist for periods 4, 8, 16, etc. (indeed, for all the periods specified by [[Sharkovskii's theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Alligood, K. T., Sauer, T., and Yorke, J.A.| title=Chaos: an introduction to dynamical systems| publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC| year=1997| isbn=0-387-94677-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharkovskii's theorem is the basis of the Li and Yorke&lt;ref&gt;[[Tien-Yien Li|Li, T. Y.]] and [[James A. Yorke|Yorke, J. A.]] &quot;Period Three Implies Chaos.&quot; [[American Mathematical Monthly]] 82, 985–92, 1975.[http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; (1975) proof that any one-dimensional system which exhibits a regular cycle of period three will also display regular cycles of every other length as well as completely chaotic orbits.

===Strange attractors===
[[File:TwoLorenzOrbits.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Lorenz attractor]] displays chaotic behavior.  These two plots demonstrate sensitive dependence on initial conditions within the region of phase space occupied by the attractor.]]
Some dynamical systems, like the one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by ''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x''), are chaotic everywhere,  but in many cases chaotic behaviour is found only in a subset of phase space. The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behaviour takes place on an [[attractor]], since then a large set of initial conditions will lead to orbits that converge to this chaotic region.

An easy way to visualize a chaotic attractor is to start with a point in the [[basin of attraction]] of the attractor, and then simply plot its subsequent orbit. Because of the topological transitivity condition, this is likely to produce a picture of the entire final attractor, and indeed both orbits shown in the figure on the right give a picture of the general shape of the Lorenz attractor.  This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the [[Edward Lorenz|Lorenz]] weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known chaotic system diagrams, probably because it was not only one of the first, but it is also one of the most complex and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern which looks like the wings of a butterfly.

Unlike [[Attractor#Fixed point|fixed-point attractors]] and ''[[limit cycle]]s'', the attractors which arise from chaotic systems, known as ''[[strange attractor]]s'', have great detail and complexity.  Strange attractors occur in both [[continuous function|continuous]] dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] systems (such as the [[Hénon map]]). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a [[Julia set]] which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points – Julia sets can be thought of as strange ''repellers''. Both strange attractors and Julia sets typically have a [[fractal]] structure, and a [[fractal dimension]] can be calculated for them.

===Minimum complexity of a chaotic system===
[[File:LogisticMap BifurcationDiagram.png|300px|thumb|right|[[Bifurcation diagram]] of the [[logistic map]] ''x'' → ''r'' ''x'' (1 – ''x'').  Each vertical slice shows the attractor for a specific value of ''r''.  The diagram displays [[Period-doubling bifurcation|period-doubling]] as ''r'' increases, eventually producing chaos.]]
Discrete chaotic systems, such as the logistic map, can exhibit strange attractors whatever their [[dimension]]ality.  However, the [[Poincaré-Bendixson theorem]] shows that a strange attractor can only arise in a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] dynamical system (specified by [[differential equation]]s) if it has three or more dimensions.  [[Dimension (vector space)|Finite dimensional]] [[linear system]]s are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behaviour it has to be either [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]], or infinite-dimensional.

The [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] states that a two dimensional differential equation has very regular behavior. The Lorenz attractor discussed above is generated by a system of three differential equations with a total of seven terms on the right hand side, five of which are linear terms and two of which are quadratic (and therefore nonlinear). Another well-known chaotic attractor is generated by the [[Rossler map|Rossler equations]] with seven terms on the right hand side, only one of which is (quadratic) nonlinear. Sprott&lt;ref&gt;

The reason is, simply put, that solutions to such systems are asymptotic to a two dimensional surface and therefore solutions are well behaved.

While the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem means that a continuous dynamical system on the Euclidean [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] cannot be chaotic, two-dimensional continuous systems with [[non-Euclidean geometry]] can exhibit chaotic behaviour.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Perhaps surprisingly, chaos may occur also in linear systems, provided they are infinite-dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

An early proponent of chaos theory was [[Henri Poincaré]]. In the 1880s, while studying the [[three-body problem]], he found that there can be orbits which are nonperiodic, and yet not forever increasing nor approaching a fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;Jules Henri Poincaré (1890) &quot;Sur le problème des trois corps et les équations de la dynamique. Divergence des séries de M.

Much of the earlier theory was developed almost entirely by mathematicians, under the name of [[ergodic theory]]. Later studies, also on the topic of nonlinear differential equations, were carried out by [[George David Birkhoff|G.D. Birkhoff]],&lt;ref&gt;George D.
